"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

with more than 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries , numerous events and prominent german literati , the leipzig book fair , which opens thursday , is hoping to become a major player on the international book scene . the annual frankfurt book fair may still be germany 's seminal event in the international world of books , but in recent years it 's been facing stiff competition from leipzig , the up-and-comming city in former communist eastern germany . this year is no different with leipzig , seemingly under the motto " bigger is better , " kicking off its annual book trade show with an even greater slew of exhibitors and events . book industry optimistic over 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries set up their stands in the cavernous trade center on the outskirts of the city .
oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair , said the number of exhibitors rose five percent compared to the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig book fair " an appearance in leipzig offers in particular small publishers an unrivalled price advantage , " said zille , who added he expected more than 100,000 visitors to the fair by sunday .
indeed , the opportunity to attract nation-wide media attention in germany and win new readers and buyers at a reasonable budget is increasingly luring new exhibitors to saxony 's second city . dieter schormann , director of a german book industry trade organization , said the positive news coming from leipzig is a sign of upturn in the ailing book trade and publishing industry , which has been plagued by crisis in the past two years . " a lot has happened in the publishing houses .
we have new collections and modernized retail stores that have adapted to market changes .
that 's why i 'm an optimist and think that i 'll be able to announce a growth rate of at least three percent by the end of the year , could be four , " schormann said . " leipzig reads " set to dazzle but away from the optimistic business aspect of the fair , the leipzig book fair is also gearing up for its literary event " leipzig reads " - an inseparable part of the annual trade that aims to show the city can lay claim to the slogan , " the biggest literature festival in europe . "

" leipzig has a significantly more familiar atmosphere than frankfurt .
there 's more reading involved , " author and journalist wibke bruhns told the daily newspaper handelsblatt . audio book a hit another continuing highlight at this year 's leipzig book fair remains the audio book .
" the audio book has a permanent place now in book fair happenings .
this dynamically expanding market also registered a profit last year of an impressive 10 percent , " said wolfgang marzin , chairman of the leipziger book fair . the leipzig book fair , which made the audio book a focus four years ago , now has over 100 exhibitors specializing in audio books .
the fair has become an important meeting point for the entire national audio book publishing industry . building literary bridges in addition to its usual attractions which include children 's and travel literature , the spring show will continue with other traditional features , in particular its role in attempting to build a literary bridge towards central and eastern europe .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said , " we have not ruled out the possibility of a compromise based on the principle of a double majority .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .

but it 's in the opposition 's best interest to cooperate ahead of the 2006 elections . anyone with visions should go see a doctor , former german chancellor helmut schmidt once said .
his successor , gerhard schröder , seems to think so as well .
it 's been a year since the chancellor stood before parliament and announced his so-called " agenda 2010 , " his social welfare , health care and labor market reform package . taking stock on thursday , schröder seemed much more sober : it 's the right thing to do , even though not everything happened the way it was supposed to .
we 've done a bad job conveying the message to the people . overall , the government 's not done too well with the reforms and that 's why there 's no time for visions any more .
schröder does n't say it like that , but it 's tangible .
the chancellor knows that he doesn ’ t have much time left to regain the public 's trust until the next general elections in 2006 .
he also knows how little progress there has been in terms of structural change . shooting the messenger still - since introducing agenda 2010 , the government 's got something that it was missing before : a common theme .
painful reforms are necessary even if they 're unpopular .
the government 's massive drop in public opinion ratings is n't only a result of the fact that people like to shoot the messenger . it also has to do with the fact that not all groups within german society have been asked to make sacrifices to the same extent .
horrible technical mistakes , such as those during the rebuilding of germany 's federal labor office or the truck toll system , also play a role .
they 're contributing to an image of the government 's inner conflicts and lack of orientation . on thursday , schröder established a framework for bringing about his reforms : we have to react to globalization , we 've been doing well for a long time , but we do n't want to lose everything to a blind neo-liberalism .
the chancellor clearly drew a line between himself and the opposition , who want to do away with job protection measures . waiting in the wings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right .
but what about christian democratic leader angela merkel ?
she must have been tempted to tear the government apart .
instead , she lauded schröder 's agenda as a first , albeit too small step in the right direction .
she signalled a willingness to cooperate .
merkel knows , how difficult it is to introduce reforms in a country which has been used to distributing surplus for the past 50 years . merkel 's the favorite in the polls right now : the more painful reforms get done until 2006 , the better , she might think .
cooperation seems better than confrontation in that situation .
germany 's recent health care reform has shown that negative aspects of a compromise reached between government and opposition will be blamed on the former .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said , " we have not ruled out the possibility of a compromise based on the principle of a double majority .

with more than 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries , numerous events and prominent german literati , the leipzig book fair , which opens thursday , is hoping to become a major player on the international book scene . the annual frankfurt book fair may still be germany 's seminal event in the international world of books , but in recent years it 's been facing stiff competition from leipzig , the up-and-comming city in former communist eastern germany . this year is no different with leipzig , seemingly under the motto " bigger is better , " kicking off its annual book trade show with an even greater slew of exhibitors and events . book industry optimistic over 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries set up their stands in the cavernous trade center on the outskirts of the city .
oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair , said the number of exhibitors rose five percent compared to the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig book fair " an appearance in leipzig offers in particular small publishers an unrivalled price advantage , " said zille , who added he expected more than 100,000 visitors to the fair by sunday .
indeed , the opportunity to attract nation-wide media attention in germany and win new readers and buyers at a reasonable budget is increasingly luring new exhibitors to saxony 's second city . dieter schormann , director of a german book industry trade organization , said the positive news coming from leipzig is a sign of upturn in the ailing book trade and publishing industry , which has been plagued by crisis in the past two years . " a lot has happened in the publishing houses .
we have new collections and modernized retail stores that have adapted to market changes .
that 's why i 'm an optimist and think that i 'll be able to announce a growth rate of at least three percent by the end of the year , could be four , " schormann said . " leipzig reads " set to dazzle but away from the optimistic business aspect of the fair , the leipzig book fair is also gearing up for its literary event " leipzig reads " - an inseparable part of the annual trade that aims to show the city can lay claim to the slogan , " the biggest literature festival in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american writer jeffrey eugenides in over 1,200 events round the clock in bars , cafes and theatres in the city , famous authors such as christa wolf , christoph hein , adolf muschg , current pulitzer prize winner jeffrey eugenides -lrb- photo -rrb- , actors and politicians like helmut kohl and angela merkel will read from their works and hold discussions . it 's an aspect that marks out the leipzig book fair from the cool professionalism of the frankfurt book show .
" leipzig has a significantly more familiar atmosphere than frankfurt .
there 's more reading involved , " author and journalist wibke bruhns told the daily newspaper handelsblatt . audio book a hit another continuing highlight at this year 's leipzig book fair remains the audio book .
" the audio book has a permanent place now in book fair happenings .
this dynamically expanding market also registered a profit last year of an impressive 10 percent , " said wolfgang marzin , chairman of the leipziger book fair . the leipzig book fair , which made the audio book a focus four years ago , now has over 100 exhibitors specializing in audio books .
the fair has become an important meeting point for the entire national audio book publishing industry . building literary bridges in addition to its usual attractions which include children 's and travel literature , the spring show will continue with other traditional features , in particular its role in attempting to build a literary bridge towards central and eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of leipzig book fair the works of new upcoming authors from the ten mainly former communist eastern countries that are poised to join the eu on may 1 , will be introduced in dozens of events that will initiate debates on the role of an expanded european union . dieter schormann is confident that an enlarged eu will bestow further importance on the leipzig book fair .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .
" we regard the reintegration of libya into the community of nations as a good move .

but it 's in the opposition 's best interest to cooperate ahead of the 2006 elections . anyone with visions should go see a doctor , former german chancellor helmut schmidt once said .
his successor , gerhard schröder , seems to think so as well .
it 's been a year since the chancellor stood before parliament and announced his so-called " agenda 2010 , " his social welfare , health care and labor market reform package . taking stock on thursday , schröder seemed much more sober : it 's the right thing to do , even though not everything happened the way it was supposed to .
we 've done a bad job conveying the message to the people . overall , the government 's not done too well with the reforms and that 's why there 's no time for visions any more .
schröder does n't say it like that , but it 's tangible .
the chancellor knows that he doesn ’ t have much time left to regain the public 's trust until the next general elections in 2006 .
he also knows how little progress there has been in terms of structural change . shooting the messenger still - since introducing agenda 2010 , the government 's got something that it was missing before : a common theme .
painful reforms are necessary even if they 're unpopular .
the government 's massive drop in public opinion ratings is n't only a result of the fact that people like to shoot the messenger . it also has to do with the fact that not all groups within german society have been asked to make sacrifices to the same extent .
horrible technical mistakes , such as those during the rebuilding of germany 's federal labor office or the truck toll system , also play a role .
they 're contributing to an image of the government 's inner conflicts and lack of orientation . on thursday , schröder established a framework for bringing about his reforms : we have to react to globalization , we 've been doing well for a long time , but we do n't want to lose everything to a blind neo-liberalism .
the chancellor clearly drew a line between himself and the opposition , who want to do away with job protection measures . waiting in the wings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right .
but what about christian democratic leader angela merkel ?
she must have been tempted to tear the government apart .
instead , she lauded schröder 's agenda as a first , albeit too small step in the right direction .
she signalled a willingness to cooperate .
merkel knows , how difficult it is to introduce reforms in a country which has been used to distributing surplus for the past 50 years . merkel 's the favorite in the polls right now : the more painful reforms get done until 2006 , the better , she might think .
cooperation seems better than confrontation in that situation .
germany 's recent health care reform has shown that negative aspects of a compromise reached between government and opposition will be blamed on the former .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .
" we regard the reintegration of libya into the community of nations as a good move .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii .

britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii .

britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2004 opinion : no time for visions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no options , really reforms of germany 's social welfare state have gotten under way and are certainly not contributing to the government 's popularity .
but it 's in the opposition 's best interest to cooperate ahead of the 2006 elections . anyone with visions should go see a doctor , former german chancellor helmut schmidt once said .
his successor , gerhard schröder , seems to think so as well .
it 's been a year since the chancellor stood before parliament and announced his so-called " agenda 2010 , " his social welfare , health care and labor market reform package . taking stock on thursday , schröder seemed much more sober : it 's the right thing to do , even though not everything happened the way it was supposed to .
we 've done a bad job conveying the message to the people . overall , the government 's not done too well with the reforms and that 's why there 's no time for visions any more .
schröder does n't say it like that , but it 's tangible .
the chancellor knows that he doesn ’ t have much time left to regain the public 's trust until the next general elections in 2006 .
he also knows how little progress there has been in terms of structural change . shooting the messenger still - since introducing agenda 2010 , the government 's got something that it was missing before : a common theme .
painful reforms are necessary even if they 're unpopular .
the government 's massive drop in public opinion ratings is n't only a result of the fact that people like to shoot the messenger . it also has to do with the fact that not all groups within german society have been asked to make sacrifices to the same extent .
horrible technical mistakes , such as those during the rebuilding of germany 's federal labor office or the truck toll system , also play a role .
they 're contributing to an image of the government 's inner conflicts and lack of orientation . on thursday , schröder established a framework for bringing about his reforms : we have to react to globalization , we 've been doing well for a long time , but we do n't want to lose everything to a blind neo-liberalism .
the chancellor clearly drew a line between himself and the opposition , who want to do away with job protection measures . waiting in the wings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right .
but what about christian democratic leader angela merkel ?
she must have been tempted to tear the government apart .
instead , she lauded schröder 's agenda as a first , albeit too small step in the right direction .
she signalled a willingness to cooperate .
merkel knows , how difficult it is to introduce reforms in a country which has been used to distributing surplus for the past 50 years . merkel 's the favorite in the polls right now : the more painful reforms get done until 2006 , the better , she might think .
cooperation seems better than confrontation in that situation .
germany 's recent health care reform has shown that negative aspects of a compromise reached between government and opposition will be blamed on the former .
the more germans associate the current problems with the coalition of social democrats and greens , the better . " you might be on top now , but just hold your breath , " was the chancellor 's silent message .
" that might be true , but we 're on our guard , " the opposition leader countered .
it 's clear that the reforms can not be avoided .
but at the moment , that 's the best news coming from crisis country germany . jens thurau -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder defends reform agenda in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the u.s. but were n't enacted by all members . in addition , summit is expected to address the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solution to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government . romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- , president of the european commission said in an interview with the financial times on wednesday , " force alone can not win the fight against terrorism , " and added that " europe 's response must be more wide-ranging than the american reaction . " divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- eu ministers call for anti-terror czar following madrid attacks europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc .
-lrb- march 20 , 2004 -rrb- germany to revamp domestic intelligence service federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week .
-lrb- march 18 , 2004 -rrb- security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the u.s. but were n't enacted by all members . in addition , summit is expected to address the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solution to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government . romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- , president of the european commission said in an interview with the financial times on wednesday , " force alone can not win the fight against terrorism , " and added that " europe 's response must be more wide-ranging than the american reaction . " divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said , " we have not ruled out the possibility of a compromise based on the principle of a double majority .

schröder does n't say it like that , but it 's tangible .
the chancellor knows that he doesn ’ t have much time left to regain the public 's trust until the next general elections in 2006 .
he also knows how little progress there has been in terms of structural change . shooting the messenger still - since introducing agenda 2010 , the government 's got something that it was missing before : a common theme .
painful reforms are necessary even if they 're unpopular .
the government 's massive drop in public opinion ratings is n't only a result of the fact that people like to shoot the messenger . it also has to do with the fact that not all groups within german society have been asked to make sacrifices to the same extent .
horrible technical mistakes , such as those during the rebuilding of germany 's federal labor office or the truck toll system , also play a role .
they 're contributing to an image of the government 's inner conflicts and lack of orientation . on thursday , schröder established a framework for bringing about his reforms : we have to react to globalization , we 've been doing well for a long time , but we do n't want to lose everything to a blind neo-liberalism .
the chancellor clearly drew a line between himself and the opposition , who want to do away with job protection measures . waiting in the wings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right .
but what about christian democratic leader angela merkel ?
she must have been tempted to tear the government apart .
instead , she lauded schröder 's agenda as a first , albeit too small step in the right direction .
she signalled a willingness to cooperate .
merkel knows , how difficult it is to introduce reforms in a country which has been used to distributing surplus for the past 50 years . merkel 's the favorite in the polls right now : the more painful reforms get done until 2006 , the better , she might think .
cooperation seems better than confrontation in that situation .
germany 's recent health care reform has shown that negative aspects of a compromise reached between government and opposition will be blamed on the former .
the more germans associate the current problems with the coalition of social democrats and greens , the better . " you might be on top now , but just hold your breath , " was the chancellor 's silent message .
" that might be true , but we 're on our guard , " the opposition leader countered .
it 's clear that the reforms can not be avoided .
but at the moment , that 's the best news coming from crisis country germany . jens thurau -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder defends reform agenda in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said , " we have not ruled out the possibility of a compromise based on the principle of a double majority .

oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair , said the number of exhibitors rose five percent compared to the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig book fair " an appearance in leipzig offers in particular small publishers an unrivalled price advantage , " said zille , who added he expected more than 100,000 visitors to the fair by sunday .
indeed , the opportunity to attract nation-wide media attention in germany and win new readers and buyers at a reasonable budget is increasingly luring new exhibitors to saxony 's second city . dieter schormann , director of a german book industry trade organization , said the positive news coming from leipzig is a sign of upturn in the ailing book trade and publishing industry , which has been plagued by crisis in the past two years . " a lot has happened in the publishing houses .
we have new collections and modernized retail stores that have adapted to market changes .
that 's why i 'm an optimist and think that i 'll be able to announce a growth rate of at least three percent by the end of the year , could be four , " schormann said . " leipzig reads " set to dazzle but away from the optimistic business aspect of the fair , the leipzig book fair is also gearing up for its literary event " leipzig reads " - an inseparable part of the annual trade that aims to show the city can lay claim to the slogan , " the biggest literature festival in europe . "

" leipzig has a significantly more familiar atmosphere than frankfurt .
there 's more reading involved , " author and journalist wibke bruhns told the daily newspaper handelsblatt . audio book a hit another continuing highlight at this year 's leipzig book fair remains the audio book .
" the audio book has a permanent place now in book fair happenings .
this dynamically expanding market also registered a profit last year of an impressive 10 percent , " said wolfgang marzin , chairman of the leipziger book fair . the leipzig book fair , which made the audio book a focus four years ago , now has over 100 exhibitors specializing in audio books .
the fair has become an important meeting point for the entire national audio book publishing industry . building literary bridges in addition to its usual attractions which include children 's and travel literature , the spring show will continue with other traditional features , in particular its role in attempting to build a literary bridge towards central and eastern europe .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the u.s. but were n't enacted by all members . in addition , summit is expected to address the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solution to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government . romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- , president of the european commission said in an interview with the financial times on wednesday , " force alone can not win the fight against terrorism , " and added that " europe 's response must be more wide-ranging than the american reaction . " divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .
-lrb- march 22 , 2004 -rrb- eu ministers call for anti-terror czar following madrid attacks europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc .
-lrb- march 20 , 2004 -rrb- germany to revamp domestic intelligence service federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week .
-lrb- march 18 , 2004 -rrb- security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .

britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii .

britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years .

gent was the figure behind vodaphone 's € 154 billion -lrb- $ 188 billion -rrb- takeover of mannesmann in 2000 .
prosecutors allege that bonuses in the millions paid to former mannesmann executives were excessive and amounted to bribes to overcome resistance to the vodaphone takeover .
esser received a bonus of € 16 million .
six former mannesmann executives are now on trial ; all deny any wrongdoing .
" never once were severance payments or retention payments mentioned by esser or myself before his agreement to the takeover , " gent told the court in düsseldorf on thursday .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the u.s. but were n't enacted by all members . in addition , summit is expected to address the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solution to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government . romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- , president of the european commission said in an interview with the financial times on wednesday , " force alone can not win the fight against terrorism , " and added that " europe 's response must be more wide-ranging than the american reaction . " divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

with more than 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries , numerous events and prominent german literati , the leipzig book fair , which opens thursday , is hoping to become a major player on the international book scene . the annual frankfurt book fair may still be germany 's seminal event in the international world of books , but in recent years it 's been facing stiff competition from leipzig , the up-and-comming city in former communist eastern germany . this year is no different with leipzig , seemingly under the motto " bigger is better , " kicking off its annual book trade show with an even greater slew of exhibitors and events . book industry optimistic over 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries set up their stands in the cavernous trade center on the outskirts of the city .
oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair , said the number of exhibitors rose five percent compared to the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig book fair " an appearance in leipzig offers in particular small publishers an unrivalled price advantage , " said zille , who added he expected more than 100,000 visitors to the fair by sunday .
indeed , the opportunity to attract nation-wide media attention in germany and win new readers and buyers at a reasonable budget is increasingly luring new exhibitors to saxony 's second city . dieter schormann , director of a german book industry trade organization , said the positive news coming from leipzig is a sign of upturn in the ailing book trade and publishing industry , which has been plagued by crisis in the past two years . " a lot has happened in the publishing houses .
we have new collections and modernized retail stores that have adapted to market changes .
that 's why i 'm an optimist and think that i 'll be able to announce a growth rate of at least three percent by the end of the year , could be four , " schormann said . " leipzig reads " set to dazzle but away from the optimistic business aspect of the fair , the leipzig book fair is also gearing up for its literary event " leipzig reads " - an inseparable part of the annual trade that aims to show the city can lay claim to the slogan , " the biggest literature festival in europe . "

" leipzig has a significantly more familiar atmosphere than frankfurt .
there 's more reading involved , " author and journalist wibke bruhns told the daily newspaper handelsblatt . audio book a hit another continuing highlight at this year 's leipzig book fair remains the audio book .
" the audio book has a permanent place now in book fair happenings .
this dynamically expanding market also registered a profit last year of an impressive 10 percent , " said wolfgang marzin , chairman of the leipziger book fair . the leipzig book fair , which made the audio book a focus four years ago , now has over 100 exhibitors specializing in audio books .
the fair has become an important meeting point for the entire national audio book publishing industry . building literary bridges in addition to its usual attractions which include children 's and travel literature , the spring show will continue with other traditional features , in particular its role in attempting to build a literary bridge towards central and eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of leipzig book fair the works of new upcoming authors from the ten mainly former communist eastern countries that are poised to join the eu on may 1 , will be introduced in dozens of events that will initiate debates on the role of an expanded european union . dieter schormann is confident that an enlarged eu will bestow further importance on the leipzig book fair .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

the report , citing unidentified u.s. officials , said the pentagon draft plan would shift emphasis in europe to smaller bases in romania and possibly bulgaria , and training bases would be set up in poland .
u.s. officials have said in the past that troop reductions in germany were in the cards , but the extent of the cuts was unknown up to now .
in asia , some 15,000 of the 100,000 troops stationed in the region would be withdrawn .
the newspaper reported that some of the troops overseas would be brought home and important equipment would be dispersed in a wider area to allow for a quicker dispatch of solders when the need arises . more briefs 25.03.2004 -pipe- east german spy christel guillaume dies 24.03.2004 -pipe- police probe internet spread of right-wing music 24.03.2004 -pipe- schily wants easier deportation of " suspect " foreigners 23.03.2004 -pipe- beleaguered bayern set to wield salary axe 23.03.2004 -pipe- famous romantic painting finds home in berlin 23.03.2004 -pipe- manhunt for suspected family killer 22.03.2004 -pipe- peta alters ' holocaust ' campaign in germany 19.03.2004 -pipe- " rosewood " spy files open for researchers radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

" let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .
" we regard the reintegration of libya into the community of nations as a good move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2004 schröder defends reform agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is hoping germany is receiving his message .
in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said , " we have not ruled out the possibility of a compromise based on the principle of a double majority .

but it 's in the opposition 's best interest to cooperate ahead of the 2006 elections . anyone with visions should go see a doctor , former german chancellor helmut schmidt once said .
his successor , gerhard schröder , seems to think so as well .
it 's been a year since the chancellor stood before parliament and announced his so-called " agenda 2010 , " his social welfare , health care and labor market reform package . taking stock on thursday , schröder seemed much more sober : it 's the right thing to do , even though not everything happened the way it was supposed to .
we 've done a bad job conveying the message to the people . overall , the government 's not done too well with the reforms and that 's why there 's no time for visions any more .
schröder does n't say it like that , but it 's tangible .
the chancellor knows that he doesn ’ t have much time left to regain the public 's trust until the next general elections in 2006 .
he also knows how little progress there has been in terms of structural change . shooting the messenger still - since introducing agenda 2010 , the government 's got something that it was missing before : a common theme .
painful reforms are necessary even if they 're unpopular .
the government 's massive drop in public opinion ratings is n't only a result of the fact that people like to shoot the messenger . it also has to do with the fact that not all groups within german society have been asked to make sacrifices to the same extent .
horrible technical mistakes , such as those during the rebuilding of germany 's federal labor office or the truck toll system , also play a role .
they 're contributing to an image of the government 's inner conflicts and lack of orientation . on thursday , schröder established a framework for bringing about his reforms : we have to react to globalization , we 've been doing well for a long time , but we do n't want to lose everything to a blind neo-liberalism .
the chancellor clearly drew a line between himself and the opposition , who want to do away with job protection measures . waiting in the wings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right .
but what about christian democratic leader angela merkel ?
she must have been tempted to tear the government apart .
instead , she lauded schröder 's agenda as a first , albeit too small step in the right direction .
she signalled a willingness to cooperate .
merkel knows , how difficult it is to introduce reforms in a country which has been used to distributing surplus for the past 50 years . merkel 's the favorite in the polls right now : the more painful reforms get done until 2006 , the better , she might think .
cooperation seems better than confrontation in that situation .
germany 's recent health care reform has shown that negative aspects of a compromise reached between government and opposition will be blamed on the former .
the more germans associate the current problems with the coalition of social democrats and greens , the better . " you might be on top now , but just hold your breath , " was the chancellor 's silent message .

with more than 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries , numerous events and prominent german literati , the leipzig book fair , which opens thursday , is hoping to become a major player on the international book scene . the annual frankfurt book fair may still be germany 's seminal event in the international world of books , but in recent years it 's been facing stiff competition from leipzig , the up-and-comming city in former communist eastern germany . this year is no different with leipzig , seemingly under the motto " bigger is better , " kicking off its annual book trade show with an even greater slew of exhibitors and events . book industry optimistic over 2,000 exhibitors from 29 countries set up their stands in the cavernous trade center on the outskirts of the city .
oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair , said the number of exhibitors rose five percent compared to the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig book fair " an appearance in leipzig offers in particular small publishers an unrivalled price advantage , " said zille , who added he expected more than 100,000 visitors to the fair by sunday .
indeed , the opportunity to attract nation-wide media attention in germany and win new readers and buyers at a reasonable budget is increasingly luring new exhibitors to saxony 's second city . dieter schormann , director of a german book industry trade organization , said the positive news coming from leipzig is a sign of upturn in the ailing book trade and publishing industry , which has been plagued by crisis in the past two years . " a lot has happened in the publishing houses .
we have new collections and modernized retail stores that have adapted to market changes .
that 's why i 'm an optimist and think that i 'll be able to announce a growth rate of at least three percent by the end of the year , could be four , " schormann said . " leipzig reads " set to dazzle but away from the optimistic business aspect of the fair , the leipzig book fair is also gearing up for its literary event " leipzig reads " - an inseparable part of the annual trade that aims to show the city can lay claim to the slogan , " the biggest literature festival in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american writer jeffrey eugenides in over 1,200 events round the clock in bars , cafes and theatres in the city , famous authors such as christa wolf , christoph hein , adolf muschg , current pulitzer prize winner jeffrey eugenides -lrb- photo -rrb- , actors and politicians like helmut kohl and angela merkel will read from their works and hold discussions . it 's an aspect that marks out the leipzig book fair from the cool professionalism of the frankfurt book show .
" leipzig has a significantly more familiar atmosphere than frankfurt .
there 's more reading involved , " author and journalist wibke bruhns told the daily newspaper handelsblatt . audio book a hit another continuing highlight at this year 's leipzig book fair remains the audio book .
" the audio book has a permanent place now in book fair happenings .
this dynamically expanding market also registered a profit last year of an impressive 10 percent , " said wolfgang marzin , chairman of the leipziger book fair . the leipzig book fair , which made the audio book a focus four years ago , now has over 100 exhibitors specializing in audio books .
the fair has become an important meeting point for the entire national audio book publishing industry . building literary bridges in addition to its usual attractions which include children 's and travel literature , the spring show will continue with other traditional features , in particular its role in attempting to build a literary bridge towards central and eastern europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of leipzig book fair the works of new upcoming authors from the ten mainly former communist eastern countries that are poised to join the eu on may 1 , will be introduced in dozens of events that will initiate debates on the role of an expanded european union . dieter schormann is confident that an enlarged eu will bestow further importance on the leipzig book fair .
" when we have the eastern expansion in a few weeks from now , then leipzig will gain more importance as a book fair in the future , as a meeting place for readers , buyers , intellectuals and fair visitors , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the u.s. but were n't enacted by all members . in addition , summit is expected to address the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solution to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government . romano prodi -lrb- photo -rrb- , president of the european commission said in an interview with the financial times on wednesday , " force alone can not win the fight against terrorism , " and added that " europe 's response must be more wide-ranging than the american reaction . " divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

european union leaders will meet in brussels on thursday to discuss improving intelligence joint gathering and coordinating counterterrorism measures in the wake of the madrid train bombings . the two-day summit is set to be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid on march 11 that killed 190 people and injured more than 1,800 .
the attacks , the worst in europe since the 1998 pan am bombing over lockerbie , scotland , have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified and coordinated counterterrorism policy . irish prime minister bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , urged his counterparts to " act decisively and in a spirit of solidarity " to tackle terrorism .
" the terrible acts in madrid … are a chilling reminder that the threat posed by terrorism affects all of us and requires a common eu response , " ahern said in a letter to eu leaders on wednesday . making progress on combating terror a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week saw the member states making progress on agreeing to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to better combat terrorism and pre-empt further attacks . thursday 's summit is expected to see the appointment of dutchman gijs de vries , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and once a member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first " anti-terrorism czar . " leaders will sign a declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance - including military aid - to any member state attacked by terrorists .
they will also warn developing nations that aid and trade benefits with the eu could be lost if they do not cooperate in the war on terrorism . the 25 european leaders are also expected to commit their governments to a june 30 deadline to implement counterterrorism measures , some which were adopted after the sept .

" divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it . both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could play into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda . the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has also suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services . germany lags but this week germany called for delays on measures to fight terrorism across the european union on account of its decentralized system , which slows decision-making . berlin said it wanted to drop the june deadlines for implementing the european arrest warrant , the creation of joint eu investigative teams , improving police and judicial cooperation and measures to counter money laundering as well as the tracking and freezing of terrorism funds . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gets tough on terror with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week .

in a speech before germany 's parliament , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday justified his government 's reform course and called on opposition members to support plans to increase funding for education and research . saying that germany 's future success depended first and foremost on the education of its children , the social democratic chancellor asked christian democrats to support the abolishment of a subsidy for homeowners that 's no longer necessary as germany is n't suffering from a housing shortage and put the money into the education sector instead . " i ask you to invest this money , which is no longer needed as a subsidy , in the future of our country , " schröder said .
he added that this could free up about € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.85 billion -rrb- the federal and state governments could invest in education .
municipalities would also receive about € 700 million that they could use to improve child care . christian democrats , who would have to back such a shift in the parliament 's upper house , which they control , have so far opposed abolishing the subsidy completely . the chancellor also expressed his support for a proposal to sell some of germany 's gold reserves and use the money for education and research funding .
" investing in research and development is vital for a country that relies on technology like ours , " schröder said . schröder took to the floor of germany 's lower house , the bundestag , to spell out his government 's legislative agenda for the remaining two years of its term . but his speech was also an attempt to rally public support for painful economic measures and welfare cuts that have caused his social democrats to slump in opinion polls to all-time lows . earlier , schröder had defended his government 's social welfare and labor market reforms , saying that they were already showing results . " today , germany is doing much better than it was 12 months ago , " he said , adding that the german economy would grow for the first time in three years in 2004 . new eu measures to combat terrorism schröder also said he believed germany 's opposition to the war in iraq had been the right decisions .
" we did the right thing back then and we 're doing the right thing today , " he said , adding that 7,000 german soldiers were participating in peacekeeping missions around the world . referring to the fight against terrorism , the chancellor said he supported greater cooperation between security agencies in europe .
he added that eu leaders were planning to adopt new measures to combat terrorism at their meeting later on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic leader angela merkel criticized schröder 's speech , saying that he had failed to present any new proposals to deal with the country 's problems .
while she said that schröder 's resignation and new elections would be the best thing for germany , merkel offered to participate in further reform plans . she added that christian democrats were willing to talk about far-reaching tax reforms .
" we 're ready to begin negotiations tomorrow , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?

european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .
first on the agenda is an action plan to combat terrorism . eu leaders arrived in brussels on thursday evening for their annual spring meeting to discuss europe 's most pressing matters .
the two-day summit will be dominated by security concerns following the deadly train bombings in madrid .
the attacks have lent a new urgency to the eu 's efforts to forge a unified counter-terrorism policy , and the leaders agreed on an ambitious new action plan during their first round of meetings .
but while the events in madrid pushed anti-terror measures to the top of the agenda , some eu leaders arrived with a sense of optimism that progress would be made on another problematic eu issue , the stalled constitution .
making progress on combating terror at a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers last week , the member states made progress on a deal to pool their resources and facilitate the sharing of information on threat groups to pre-empt further attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries has been named eu " anti-terrorism czar " .
on thursday evening , the leaders appointed dutchman gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- , former deputy minister in the dutch foreign ministry and an erstwhile member of the european parliament , as the eu 's first anti-terrorism czar - europe 's answer to washington 's department of homeland security . leaders also signed a nato-style declaration of solidarity pledging automatic assistance , including military aid , to any member state attacked by terrorists .
in addition , they addressed the underlying causes of terrorism by underlining the need to find solutions to global crises including the arab-israeli conflict and speeding up the transfer of power to a sovereign iraqi government .
divisions persist despite widespread agreement on the need to coordinate efforts to tackle terrorism , differences still need to be ironed out among member states on the best way to go about it .
both french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have misgivings about sharing sensitive intelligence with all 25 current and soon-to-be eu members .
the two fear that such a move would invariably lead to damaging information leaks that could fall into the hands of terrorist outfits like al qaeda .
the two leaders are also opposed to establishing a european intelligence agency , modeled after the cia as proposed by belgium and austria .
france has suggested that information-swapping be limited to a small core group of the five largest eu states , including italy , spain and germany , which have the largest intelligence services .
an agreement on the constitution in sight ?
the ongoing saga over the eu constitution has not been entirely pushed off the radar screen by security concerns .
upon arriving in brussels , many eu leaders expressed optimism that progress would be made .
the spanish and polish governments have signaled that their positions have softened , making the possibility of a compromise before the end of the irish presidency all the more likely .
according to pat cox , the president of the european parliament , a compromise is " within reach . "
the row has pitted germany and france against spain and poland over voting rights .
germany and france wanted to change the system to require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population , while spain and poland wanted to retain the preferential voting rights they negotiated at the nice summit in 2000 .
now both are considering the " double majority " system proposed by the irish presidency , which would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts and tip the scales - ever so slightly - in favor of smaller states .

british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .

where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .

"
british prime minister tony blair has held talks in libya , extending a " hand in partnership " to col. moammar gadhafi .
once a pariah in the west , the libyan leader is edging back into the international fold . once condemned as the " mad dog of the middle east " by u.s. president ronald reagan , gadhafi 's historic handshake with britain 's tony blair on thursday is a further step in his efforts to gain acceptance by the western leaders , who have spurned him for decades as a backer of terrorists . before he left for tripoli on thursday , blair said he will not " forget the pain of the past , " referring to the bombing of a pan am airliner over lockerbie that killed 270 and accusations that gadhafi armed ira guerillas , but added that countries that agreed to cooperate with the international community should be embraced . " let us offer to states that want to renounce terrorism and the development of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons our hand in partnership to achieve it as libya has rightly and courageously decided to do , " blair told reporters in lisbon before he left for tripoli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nose section of the pan am boeing 747 after crashing near lockerbie , scotland .
in december , libya announced it would abandon efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction , a further step in mending ties with the west after it agreed to take pay damages for the 1988 lockerbie bombing -lrb- photo -rrb- . blair will meet with gadhafi in a tent outside the capital tripoli , the first british leader to visit libya since winston churchill did so in world war ii . " i believe in dealing with these issues in whatever way we can , " blair told reporters on wednesday .
" when we have to take action , we take action .
where we can by diplomacy and negotiation bring people to a more sensible strategy for the future , let us also do that . " unhappy history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial to british police officer yvonne fletcher .
britain has had a series of grievances with the north african country .
it broke off diplomatic relations with libya in 1984 after a british policewoman , yvonne fletcher , was killed by a shot fired from the libyan embassy in london . the lockerbie bombing in 1988 marked the low point of relations . but in 1999 , the two countries restored diplomatic ties after libya accepted responsibility for fletcher 's shooting , apologized and offered compensation to her family .
some in britain however want blair to press libya for further cooperation in the investigation into fletcher 's death . business eager to mend ties for many years libya was effectively off-limits for british business , since it was under un sanctions .
those sanctions were lifted after the lockerbie admission . now british companies , including shell and the british aerospace firm bae , have been looking for new business opportunities in the country . libya has a large oil and gas industry that is still undeveloped , with plentiful reserves that are largely untapped .
the country 's proximity to european markets also makes it attractive to european concerns , who are eager to get into the country before american competitors do . on thursday , shell has said it signed a preliminary agreement with libya for gas exploration rights .
a spokesman for blair told reuters earlier that the deal was worth $ 200 million -lrb- € 165 million -rrb- and possibly up to $ 1 billion -lrb- € 823 million -rrb- . bae is talking with libya about aviation projects , including possible aircraft sales . tourism development is also under consideration for the sun-drenched , largely desert country .
reports say a british firm is negotiating permission to build a 500 hectare -lrb- 1,235 acre -rrb- tourism complex , with a luxury marina , golf courses and fitness clubs . controversy over reasons for visit critics of the trip say blair 's visit is motivated more by business interests rather than politics , and have called it a misguided attempt at appeasement . the opposition conservative party has called the timing " highly questionable " since it comes one day after a memorial service in spain for the victims of the madrid train bombings . britain 's former ambassador to libya , oliver miles , told the bbc that he also questioned the timing and methods , but said while it was known that gadhafi supported a range of terrorist and national liberation groups , " he has n't done that in the last 10 years . " some relatives of victims of the lockerbie bombing welcomed the diplomatic milestone . " so long as libya is indeed turning her back on terrorism we feel this is a good thing , " jim swire , a spokesman for some of the lockerbie relatives , told reuters .
" we regard the reintegration of libya into the community of nations as a good move .

in a discussion paper , the imf said its surveillance had missed warning signs and had over-estimated growth and the success of economic reforms .
argentina 's debt default in 2001 triggered an economic crisis , pushing half the population into poverty .
the default cut off international lending until 2003 , when a fresh $ 13.3bn imf loan package was agreed .
many argentines still blame the imf for their continuing problems .
the country repaid the fund more than $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- in arrears earlier in march , clearing the way for a fresh $ 3.1bn loan .
over-optimism the imf 's examination of what happened in the runup to the implosion in 2001 says there was no single cause .
the deteriorating state of public debt as off-budget spending swelled combined with institutional weaknesses and the rigidities imposed by the pegging of the peso to the us dollar , it found .
it also said private lenders continued to pour money in despite evidence of mounting problems following the onset of recession in 1998 .
but the imf admitted it , too , failed to see the problems that lay ahead for a country which - till the meltdown - was often seen as an exemplar of imf-mandated economic reform .
one problem , the discussion paper acknowledges , is that it failed to see how the actual structure of the argentine economy was combining with the reform process .
lessons could be learnt to help the fund deal with future crises , it said , including paying more attention to the effect of exchange rates .
argentina still owes about $ 88bn to private foreign creditors , and negotiations are proceeding slowly despite imf pressure .

in a discussion paper , the imf said its surveillance had missed warning signs and had over-estimated growth and the success of economic reforms .
argentina 's debt default in 2001 triggered an economic crisis , pushing half the population into poverty .
the default cut off international lending until 2003 , when a fresh $ 13.3bn imf loan package was agreed .
many argentines still blame the imf for their continuing problems .
the country repaid the fund more than $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- in arrears earlier in march , clearing the way for a fresh $ 3.1bn loan .
over-optimism the imf 's examination of what happened in the runup to the implosion in 2001 says there was no single cause .
the deteriorating state of public debt as off-budget spending swelled combined with institutional weaknesses and the rigidities imposed by the pegging of the peso to the us dollar , it found .
it also said private lenders continued to pour money in despite evidence of mounting problems following the onset of recession in 1998 .
but the imf admitted it , too , failed to see the problems that lay ahead for a country which - till the meltdown - was often seen as an exemplar of imf-mandated economic reform .
one problem , the discussion paper acknowledges , is that it failed to see how the actual structure of the argentine economy was combining with the reform process .
lessons could be learnt to help the fund deal with future crises , it said , including paying more attention to the effect of exchange rates .
argentina still owes about $ 88bn to private foreign creditors , and negotiations are proceeding slowly despite imf pressure .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- talks over aviation job cuts bbc news / wales graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- magazine thursday , 25 march , 2004 , 06:54 gmt talks over aviation job cuts defence minister adam ingram has been asked for assurances over the future of aviation maintenance jobs in south wales , following news that 550 posts are to be axed .
vale of glamorgan mp john smith spoke to the minister on thursday about his concerns that many more jobs could be at risk at the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- , which is in his constituency .
the uk government agency employs 2,000 people at st athan , but it is losing work to the raf .
there are fears the cuts could undermine thousands more jobs planned for the site under project red dragon - a world-class aviation centre .
but speaking after the meeting mr smith said the other jobs were not necessarily under threat and he felt a " lot better " about the situation .
he said that mr ingram explained that the decision to cut the jobs was " exceptional " .
" he -lrb- mr ingram -rrb- took me through the circumstances and said they would not be repeated in the future , " he said .
" he also said he would publish the investment appraisal that was used to make that decision and he will also do so with future contracts .
" that re-assures me because it means that the workforce at st athan can see how they 're doing , " he added .
dara , which has two sites in wales , is the biggest government-owned aerospace repair facility in europe and its future had been under review for several months .
some of the losses announced on wednesday at the plant , which currently employs 2,000 people , are down to a decision to upgrade harrier jump-jets " in-house " by the raf at its base at cottesmore in leicestershire , instead of st athan .
the work in st athan is due to be succeeded by the £ 77m project red dragon - a world-class aviation centre complete with superhangar .
but the rest of the jobs losses are down to streamlining - mainly because project red dragon will be operated over a space of 100 acres where as dara currently works over a 1,000 acre site .
mr ingram also said on thursday that " up to " 550 jobs could be lost - rather than the whole figure .
" this is going to the trade unions for consultation and mr ingram said the figure was negotiable , " said mr smith .
" so i think there could well be a case for keeping some of the jobs on for when additional work comes to the site . "
defence secretary , geoff hoon , told the commons on thursday that the government was " absolutely committed " to the red dragon aviation project despite the job cuts there .
" we believe the people engaged in it have a significant role to play in the future , " he said .
welsh economic development minister andrew davies has admitted that many of the job losses were not unexpected .
" that dara would need to make efficiencies to become even more competitive in a tough market is a recognised fact , " he said .
" but clearly one that does not make this announcement any more welcome or any less of a blow to those directly affected . "
he said the development of project red dragon was " crucial " to maintaining the south wales aerospace cluster , and if successful , would create 5,000 jobs over 10 years .

vale of glamorgan mp john smith spoke to the minister on thursday about his concerns that many more jobs could be at risk at the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- , which is in his constituency .
the uk government agency employs 2,000 people at st athan , but it is losing work to the raf .
there are fears the cuts could undermine thousands more jobs planned for the site under project red dragon - a world-class aviation centre .
but speaking after the meeting mr smith said the other jobs were not necessarily under threat and he felt a " lot better " about the situation .
he said that mr ingram explained that the decision to cut the jobs was " exceptional " .
" he -lrb- mr ingram -rrb- took me through the circumstances and said they would not be repeated in the future , " he said .
" he also said he would publish the investment appraisal that was used to make that decision and he will also do so with future contracts .
" that re-assures me because it means that the workforce at st athan can see how they 're doing , " he added .
dara , which has two sites in wales , is the biggest government-owned aerospace repair facility in europe and its future had been under review for several months .
some of the losses announced on wednesday at the plant , which currently employs 2,000 people , are down to a decision to upgrade harrier jump-jets " in-house " by the raf at its base at cottesmore in leicestershire , instead of st athan .
contracts have been lost to the raf the work in st athan is due to be succeeded by the £ 77m project red dragon - a world-class aviation centre complete with superhangar .
but the rest of the jobs losses are down to streamlining - mainly because project red dragon will be operated over a space of 100 acres where as dara currently works over a 1,000 acre site .
mr ingram also said on thursday that " up to " 550 jobs could be lost - rather than the whole figure .
" this is going to the trade unions for consultation and mr ingram said the figure was negotiable , " said mr smith .
" so i think there could well be a case for keeping some of the jobs on for when additional work comes to the site . "
defence secretary , geoff hoon , told the commons on thursday that the government was " absolutely committed " to the red dragon aviation project despite the job cuts there .
" we believe the people engaged in it have a significant role to play in the future , " he said .
welsh economic development minister andrew davies has admitted that many of the job losses were not unexpected .
" that dara would need to make efficiencies to become even more competitive in a tough market is a recognised fact , " he said .
" but clearly one that does not make this announcement any more welcome or any less of a blow to those directly affected . "
he said the development of project red dragon was " crucial " to maintaining the south wales aerospace cluster , and if successful , would create 5,000 jobs over 10 years .

the project has incorporated the 12 volumes of the dictionary of the older scottish tongue and all 10 of the scottish national dictionary .

those behind the dundee university venture hope students , lecturers and other interested people throughout the world will use the new dictionary .
the resource , which was three years in the making , has also included snippets of speeches from the closing session of the scottish parliament in 1707 and the words spoken at the declaration of arbroath .
english lecturer victor skretkowicz , who led the project with lexicographer susan rennie victor , said : " for nearly a century , successive editors of the dictionary of the older scottish tongue and the scottish national dictionary laboured to create a historical and cultural record of scots , from 1200 to 1976 .

both dictionaries are essential resources for scholars of the language , history , and culture of scotland " john simpson oxford english dictionary " the 22 volumes contain hundreds of thousands of quotes describing all walks of life but now through a process of virtual integration the dictionary of the scots language brings their linguistic , historical and cultural records together and facilitates rapid searching of their contents .

the hike is due to rising demand in china which is threatening to create shortages in certain metals .
corus director scott macdonald said prices could rise by " up to 20 % in the rest of the eu " .
the company which has recently seen a narrowing of its losses had previously indicated it would raise prices by 10 % .
falling stocks but china 's rampant economic growth is putting huge pressure on the price of raw materials .
copper stocks are 25 % lower than two years ago , while platinum has doubled in price in the same timeframe .
" there are stocks ... but these are falling fast , " tony warwick-ching , a copper consultant at the commodities research unit told the bbc .
" the question now is are they going to run out ...
china is not particularly rich in natural resources so it is sucking in raw materials from the rest of the world . "
meanwhile , corus is reported to be seeking a joint venture for its aluminium business .

ryton was the only factory in the peugeot citroen group to operate on a four shift basis .
the shift was introduced in december 2002 to help the plant launch two new models , the 206 sw and gti 180 , which are only built at ryton .
the new three shift system will become operational from june .
the company begins a 90-day consultation period with employee representatives on thursday in an attempt to reduce the impact on the 700 workers affected .
workers have fought hard to keep the shift , agreeing to take a wage cut last year to protect jobs .
duncan simpson from amicus said it is a " real blow " to workers , but it is part of the agreement they signed up to .
the firm said they will also provide support to staff in their search for alternative employment .
ryton is the third largest car plant in the country , producing more than 200,000 peugeot 206s a year .

the timber was seized by customs officers after the consignment of afromosia arrived in the uk without the required export documents from zaire .
it has now been used to build a £ 2m centre at wakehurst place , ardingly .
andy jackson , head of wakehurst place , said the royal botanic gardens became involved over the implementation of plant conservation issues .
' beautiful timber ' conservation strategies are set out under the convention on international trade in endangered species - an international agreement to protect wild animals and plants from exploitation .
mr jackson said : " working with customs we carry out inspections of plant consignments to ensure conformity with the convention .
" after seizure we negotiate the final use of the plant material and hence our use of this beautiful timber . "
the wood was used to construct the end walls of the visitor centre which has a cafe and sells tickets , gifts and plants .
the estate is home to the £ 80m millennium seed bank and europe 's first reserve dedicated to rare mosses , lichens , liverworts and filmy ferns which grow on the rare sandstone outcrop at wakehurst .

assembly members have cried foul over pavement mess and have agreed to plans to treble fines from £ 25 to £ 75 .
it will also allow mean councils can keep the proceeds from the fines and reinvest in more dog wardens .
previously the cash went to the treasury .
the measures - part of labour 's attempts to reduce anti-social behaviour - were supported by ams when unveiled by environment minister carwyn jones .
he has warned that tourists could be put off visiting wales if pavements and roadsides were not kept clean .
' act responsibly ' he said : " people need to realise that dog-fouling and fly-tipping also have an economic impact in terms of attracting inward investment and tourism .
" few people and businesses are going to be attracted to visit or invest in places covered in litter and dog mess . "
dog fouling fines 393 owners caught in 2003 141 owners caught in 2002 tegryn jones , director of keep wales tidy , said dog fouling was an unpleasant problem and now dog owners needed to be aware that they faced tougher action .
he said : " what 's important with any fine is that it acts as a deterrent and then it needs to be implemented .
" i 've got a dog myself and when i walk it i make sure i clean up after it .
it does n't take very much effort at all to act responsibly . "
already , more dog owners are being caught by the £ 25 fixed penalties .

swansea council. which welcomed the move , has already issued 100 fixed penalty notices to dog owners in recent years .

a council spokesman said : " this is in addition to an education campaign to drive home the message that dog owners have the responsibility to clean-up after their pets and keep swansea free from dog mess . "
the authority , which spends £ 2.5m in total each year on street cleaning , is also looking closely at the issue of litter and is considering on-the-spot fines in the future .
mr jones , welcoming the new regulations , said they could only benefit communities .
he said : " we all want to see our environments improving and becoming safe places for everyone to live and play .
i hope that increasing these fixed penalties will help us to achieve this . "

ten years ago a poll found that 97 % of people supported keeping water in the public sector .
but research by the scottish consumer council -lrb- scc -rrb- suggested that the figure has now dropped to 70 % .
the scc said the majority of people questioned still want to see a publicly funded system , but about a third were unhappy with the current service .
the drop has been attributed to concerns about levels of investment and inefficiencies in the industry .
the council said many households had also seen a rise in water charges and that these increases were being used to keep the cost of water down for businesses .
however , the federation of small businesses argued that it was the other way around .

it added that it believes that in the next two years it will prove that the public sector model for water in scotland works .

cameras help the robots to score the robo-athletes in san francisco came in all shapes and sizes .
and they came from 11 different nations , including japan , germany and canada .
the event , hosted by the robotics society of america -lrb- rsa -rrb- , included robot football , maze-solving and even sumo wrestling .
" one of the goals is to cross-pollinate , so that a guy building a combat robot can meet a really good programmer who builds autonomous sumo robots , " said david calkins , president of the rsa .
robot combat proved a popular draw and involved two robots from the same weight class fighting for dominance in a boxing ring .
humans with remote controls directed the action from outside the ring .
cultural differences the competitions seemed to break down along cultural lines .
the japanese robots reigned supreme when it came to sumo-wrestling , while the european teams showed off their skills on the football pitch .
some robots are designed to intimidate as for the american machines , they specialised in demolishing the living hell out of each other in one-on-one robot combat .
california native pat lindstrom and his buddies have put us $ 25,000 of their own money , not to mention 3,000 hours of engineering , into their 340 pound , super-heavyweight , blue max .
the robot has got a flat , rectangular shape , with big tyres on the four corners .
a wedge on the front enhances blue max 's smashing potential .
a stencil on the back of pat lindstrom 's behemoth says it is a good day to die .
" our plan is to attack the guy at 20 or 30 miles per hour , and slam ' em into the wall , " said mr lindstrom .
balky 2 , a robot created by yayoi matsunaga was not made for fighting .
at 18 inches tall , it is designed to climb stairs , turn somersaults and be a bit more human .
" the combat robots are impressive but they ca n't be a part of human 's daily life , " she said .
" we 're trying to make robots that are a little more friendly , that are communicative , can make eye contact and things . "
doing it for themselves other robot builders at the robolympics were looking to creating autonomous robots that function largely outside of human control .
" you 'll stand back and turn on a switch and you hope to god that your robot does what it 's designed to do , " said canadian attendee david hrynkiw .
others are more friendly " you trust in the world of bit-gods and you 're trusting the robot to do it itself , " he added .
mr hrynkiw 's robots are mini-sumo wrestlers .
they weigh just over a pound , and are only a few inches tall .
they are not fat , and they do not throw salt into the ring before a match .
but like human sumo wrestlers , these guys take care of business quickly .
they wheel around the ring until they bump into each other .
one of them manages to push the other outside the tiny ring and that 's about it .
the robotic football competition is more complex .
teams of five autonomous robots play on a small field .
the robots are aided by cameras , hanging above the action .
" the info goes from the camera to the computer , so the program knows where each robot is , and it knows the ball is , where the speed is , and also the direction , " said marko wickrath , who is part of the german football team .
" it runs through strategies and calculates future positions .
then a transmitter gives the robots the positions . "
this kind of autonomous robot technology is already proving useful in the real world .
for example , some robots can be trained to search buildings for earthquake survivors .
but the contestants at the robolympics admit they would be more likely to settle for robots that can clear snow from the driveway or bring them a cold beer at the end of a long day of competition .

cameras help the robots to score the robo-athletes in san francisco came in all shapes and sizes .
and they came from 11 different nations , including japan , germany and canada .
the event , hosted by the robotics society of america -lrb- rsa -rrb- , included robot football , maze-solving and even sumo wrestling .
" one of the goals is to cross-pollinate , so that a guy building a combat robot can meet a really good programmer who builds autonomous sumo robots , " said david calkins , president of the rsa .
robot combat proved a popular draw and involved two robots from the same weight class fighting for dominance in a boxing ring .
humans with remote controls directed the action from outside the ring .
cultural differences the competitions seemed to break down along cultural lines .
the japanese robots reigned supreme when it came to sumo-wrestling , while the european teams showed off their skills on the football pitch .
some robots are designed to intimidate as for the american machines , they specialised in demolishing the living hell out of each other in one-on-one robot combat .
california native pat lindstrom and his buddies have put us $ 25,000 of their own money , not to mention 3,000 hours of engineering , into their 340 pound , super-heavyweight , blue max .
the robot has got a flat , rectangular shape , with big tyres on the four corners .
a wedge on the front enhances blue max 's smashing potential .
a stencil on the back of pat lindstrom 's behemoth says it is a good day to die .
" our plan is to attack the guy at 20 or 30 miles per hour , and slam ' em into the wall , " said mr lindstrom .
balky 2 , a robot created by yayoi matsunaga was not made for fighting .
at 18 inches tall , it is designed to climb stairs , turn somersaults and be a bit more human .
" the combat robots are impressive but they ca n't be a part of human 's daily life , " she said .
" we 're trying to make robots that are a little more friendly , that are communicative , can make eye contact and things . "
doing it for themselves other robot builders at the robolympics were looking to creating autonomous robots that function largely outside of human control .
" you 'll stand back and turn on a switch and you hope to god that your robot does what it 's designed to do , " said canadian attendee david hrynkiw .
others are more friendly " you trust in the world of bit-gods and you 're trusting the robot to do it itself , " he added .
mr hrynkiw 's robots are mini-sumo wrestlers .
they weigh just over a pound , and are only a few inches tall .
they are not fat , and they do not throw salt into the ring before a match .
but like human sumo wrestlers , these guys take care of business quickly .
they wheel around the ring until they bump into each other .
one of them manages to push the other outside the tiny ring and that 's about it .
the robotic football competition is more complex .
teams of five autonomous robots play on a small field .
the robots are aided by cameras , hanging above the action .
" the info goes from the camera to the computer , so the program knows where each robot is , and it knows the ball is , where the speed is , and also the direction , " said marko wickrath , who is part of the german football team .
" it runs through strategies and calculates future positions .

for example , some robots can be trained to search buildings for earthquake survivors .
but the contestants at the robolympics admit they would be more likely to settle for robots that can clear snow from the driveway or bring them a cold beer at the end of a long day of competition .

the prime minister 's strategy unit has spent the last year looking at whether british sea fishing has a long-term future as a profitable industry , or is doomed to a state of perpetual crisis .
the study 's conclusions are that it has the potential to make far more money than at present - but only if the industry embraces major change backed up by government reforms in the management of fish stocks .
tony blair 's advisers point out that parts of the fleet such as the mackerel boats in some areas and the shellfish sector already make decent profits .
but the big problem is with the trawlers , sailing mainly from scottish ports , chasing white fish such as north sea cod - said by marine scientists to be perilously close to a state of collapse .
cuts it is for this fleet which the strategy unit is recommending further cuts of 13 % to enable it to land fish at competitive prices without further damaging stocks .
given that the scottish industry has already scrapped around half of its fleet , it is not surprising that this recommendation is causing dismay amongst many groups in scotland .
the study is facing widespread criticism in scotland for being based on flawed research the strategy unit says that uk fishermen will face increasing competition from other parts of the world where major reforms have already taken place - and believes similar steps should be taken here .
in new zealand and iceland , for instance , quotas are attached to individual vessels rather than collective fleets , giving greater incentives for fishermen to look after the long-term health of the stocks - and to stick to the rules .
the report argues that the highly-centralised system of setting eu quotas from brussels should be replaced by regional fisheries management which would make decisions based on genuine conservation needs , rather than the annual bartering which takes place amongst ministers , often in the middle of the night .
and it favours a move towards a system operated in the faroe islands in which stocks are conserved through " effort control " - the number of days fishermen can spend at sea - rather than quotas based on tonnes of individual fish species .
market advantage that should help prevent the ludicrous situation in which large quantities of dead fish are thrown overboard because a vessel has reached the limit of its legal quota .
environmental groups are delighted at the conclusions of the report , especially its emphasis on the link between sustainable fishing and long-term profits .
the study points out that many big fisheries around the world are attempting to get their products certified with an " eco-label " from the marine stewardship council which guarantees to consumers that stocks are not being over-fished .
this can give a clear market advantage as supermarkets and producers of processed fish are keen to offer their customers the assurance that their products are not damaging the environment .
the strategy unit says key uk fish stocks should aspire to achieve msc certification by 2015 .
for thursday 's report to become anything more than a piece of theoretical research , its recommendations will need to be embraced not just by uk ministers and the devolved governments , but by the eu and crucially the industry itself .
judging by the furious reaction from scottish fishing groups ahead of its publication - as well as the scottish national party and the conservatives - that seems a tall order .
the study is facing widespread criticism in scotland for being based on flawed research - with many claiming that its recommendations would sound the death knell for the industry , rather than providing the lifeline claimed by its authors .
