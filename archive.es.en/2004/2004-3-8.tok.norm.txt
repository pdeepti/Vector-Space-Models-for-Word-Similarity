greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .
karamanlis said he would make those issues a priority . " we must make the best efforts so the olympic games are the best and safest ever held .
it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .
the greek side is due to join the european union in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek socialist leader george papandreou , center , casts his vote in a polling station in larissa , central greece on sunday march 7 , 2004 .
former foreign minister george papandreou , like karamanlis the scion of another important greek political family , was able to claw back some of the conservatives lead in recent weeks , but not enough to prevent the conservative new democracy -lrb- nd -rrb- from taking over . although papandreou remains popular in greece , he came to the election campaign late as outgoing premier costas simitis handed him the pasok leadership .
simitis and other top members of the socialist party are being blamed for torpedoing papandreou 's chances of retaining power . parties need at least three percent of the vote to enter parliament .
the greek communist party is expected to clear the threshold , and the left coalition is struggling to retain a seat .
some exit polls also showed a rise in votes for the ultra-nationalist and anti-immigrant party , laos . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greek , turkish cypriots reach deal on unifying island greek and turkish cypriot negotiators agreed to a u.n.-proposed plan to unify the divided island , ending marathon negotiations in new york .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .
a company spokesman said it will now look at extending workers ' hours at other sites . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de union and employers agree to wage deal germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .

daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .

" the nation will lose out , as joining the eu requires the new members to scrap their own bilateral trade agreements with non-eu states , " the officially-run paper wrote on monday .
unlike russia , as a member of the world trade organization , china is entitled to compensation under international trade rules .
the eu has been at loggerheads with russia , refusing to expand a bilateral trade and cooperation agreement to cover the new member states unless its demands are met .
china wants to see lower tariffs or perhaps increased quotas , the paper says .
the u.s. , japan and australia are also expected to apply for compensation .
eu-china trade was worth € 115 billion -lrb- $ 142.3 billion -rrb- in 2002 , with a chinese surplus of € 47 billion .

greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .
karamanlis said he would make those issues a priority . " we must make the best efforts so the olympic games are the best and safest ever held .
it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

simitis and other top members of the socialist party are being blamed for torpedoing papandreou 's chances of retaining power . parties need at least three percent of the vote to enter parliament .

it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc secret network prepares for norwegian eu battle initiated by center party leader , åslaug haga , the parliamentarian leader of norway ’ s ruling christian democratic party , jon lilletun and the socialist left party have met to gear up for the expected third battle over norwegian eu membership . " we are getting a forum established together with people from trade unions , agriculture , fisheries and the political parties , " haga explained to norwegian daily aftenposten .
" this is only the beginning , up to now there has mainly been contacts at the informal level . "
the issue is sensitive as the leader of the participating christian democratic party , kjell magne bondevik , is the prime minister of norway .
he is heading the current norwegian coalition government made up of the conservative party , the christian democratic party and the liberal left .
these three parties disagree on eu membership but have agreed not to raise the issue during this parliament .
lilletun dismissed the question of whether the christian democratic party would have to leave government when engaging actively on the no-side .
according to lilletun , the conservative party , which is also a member of the ruling coalition , has also been pushing the eu question lately .
he would not confirm whether the prime minister had been informed about the network .
norway has already held two referendums on eu membership , in 1972 and 1994 .
both ended with victory for the ' no ' side .
the discussion over eu membership is expected to heat up again in the run-up to the next election , which will be held in september 2005 .

" we are getting a forum established together with people from trade unions , agriculture , fisheries and the political parties , " haga explained to norwegian daily aftenposten .
" this is only the beginning , up to now there has mainly been contacts at the informal level . "
the issue is sensitive as the leader of the participating christian democratic party , kjell magne bondevik , is the prime minister of norway .
he is heading the current norwegian coalition government made up of the conservative party , the christian democratic party and the liberal left .
these three parties disagree on eu membership but have agreed not to raise the issue during this parliament .
lilletun dismissed the question of whether the christian democratic party would have to leave government when engaging actively on the no-side .
according to lilletun , the conservative party , which is also a member of the ruling coalition , has also been pushing the eu question lately .
he would not confirm whether the prime minister had been informed about the network .
norway has already held two referendums on eu membership , in 1972 and 1994 .
both ended with victory for the ' no ' side .
the discussion over eu membership is expected to heat up again in the run-up to the next election , which will be held in september 2005 .

" we are getting a forum established together with people from trade unions , agriculture , fisheries and the political parties , " haga explained to norwegian daily aftenposten .
" this is only the beginning , up to now there has mainly been contacts at the informal level . "
the issue is sensitive as the leader of the participating christian democratic party , kjell magne bondevik , is the prime minister of norway .
he is heading the current norwegian coalition government made up of the conservative party , the christian democratic party and the liberal left .
these three parties disagree on eu membership but have agreed not to raise the issue during this parliament .
lilletun dismissed the question of whether the christian democratic party would have to leave government when engaging actively on the no-side .
according to lilletun , the conservative party , which is also a member of the ruling coalition , has also been pushing the eu question lately .
he would not confirm whether the prime minister had been informed about the network .
norway has already held two referendums on eu membership , in 1972 and 1994 .
both ended with victory for the ' no ' side .
the discussion over eu membership is expected to heat up again in the run-up to the next election , which will be held in september 2005 .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .
a company spokesman said it will now look at extending workers ' hours at other sites . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de union and employers agree to wage deal germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday .

greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .
karamanlis said he would make those issues a priority . " we must make the best efforts so the olympic games are the best and safest ever held .
it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

simitis and other top members of the socialist party are being blamed for torpedoing papandreou 's chances of retaining power . parties need at least three percent of the vote to enter parliament .

greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .
karamanlis said he would make those issues a priority . " we must make the best efforts so the olympic games are the best and safest ever held .
it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

simitis and other top members of the socialist party are being blamed for torpedoing papandreou 's chances of retaining power . parties need at least three percent of the vote to enter parliament .
the greek communist party is expected to clear the threshold , and the left coalition is struggling to retain a seat .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .

on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .

karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .
karamanlis said he would make those issues a priority . " we must make the best efforts so the olympic games are the best and safest ever held .
it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .

daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .

other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .

greece 's opposition conservatives won the country 's general election on sunday , ending over a decade of rule by the socialists . greek voters decided to send the pan hellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- packing by giving the opposition new democracy party led by costas karamanlis a resounding victory . with 97 percent of votes counted , the conservatives were heading for 165 seats in the 300-member parliament and 45.5 percent of the vote , according to reuters .
the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .

unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.03.2004 germany struggles to close gender gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still mostly mommy 's job .
germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .

the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .

other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .

germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .

the socialists won around 40 percent of the vote .
under the greek electoral system , the winning party takes the lion 's share of seats . the election is being regarded as one of the most important in modern history .
aside from a three-year break , pasok has ruled the country since 1981 .
but greeks have become disenchanted with the socialists in recent years amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement .
this time they opted for new democracy and karamanlis , a 47-year-old u.s.-educated lawyer , who is the nephew of a former greek prime minister . the change in government comes only months ahead of athens hosting the olympic games , which has been plagued by construction delays , security concerns and other problems .

it is a great opportunity for greece to show its modern face , " he said , according to reuters . karamanlis promises change karamanlis has promised to slash bureaucracy and he wants tax cuts to fuel growth and cut an unemployment rate of about 9 percent .
although greece has one of the highest growth rates in the european union , at 4.7 percent , it is inflated by olympic projects .
karamanlis has also complained that greece 's economy could be stronger if the socialists had better managed eu funds aimed at improving its infrastructure . karamanlis will also have to tackle difficult talks on the future of cyprus , which remains split into greek and turkish halves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.03.2004 germany struggles to close gender gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still mostly mommy 's job .
germany joins the world in celebrating international women 's day on monday , but the country is still far from reaching gender equality : the income gap between german men and women is among the largest in europe . while women in the european union earn 16 percent less than their male colleagues on average , they get 20 percent less in germany , according to a recent eu report . part of the problem is that women often end up working in jobs with few possibilities for promotion , such as secretarial work , said ulrike liebert , a professor for european studies at bremen university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a fairly unusual sight in germany .
another reason for the gender gap is the time women spend raising children : with fewer years of work experience , they end up earning less money .
on top of that , a long career interruption because of children also makes it harder to return to work . still , many women with children end up leaving their jobs because they can not find adequate child care .
trying to combine work and family is becoming more and more difficult for young german women , according to liebert . " many in germany still have this idea that a woman , a mother , should stay at home with the children , " she said .
" they 're considered bad mothers if they sent their children to kindergarten before the age of three . " more child day care the key to equality ? germany 's lack of kindergarten spaces was also criticized by trade union representatives , who called it the biggest reason for continuing gender inequality .
" it 's alarming when every third woman decides not to have children because she 's afraid that she 'll have to give up her career , " said margret mönig-raane , a deputy leader of service sector union verdi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks child care facilities .
other union leaders criticized a 2001 agreement between the government and business leaders to work towards gender equality in the work place : since more than 70 percent of businesses ignore the agreement , the government should have insisted on a gender equality law rather than rely on a non-binding agreement . meanwhile , government and business leaders on monday were expected to unveil a new program to promote gender equality .
it calls on businesses to give employees more flexibility with taking breaks so that they can pick up their children from school or day care .
employees with children should also get first pick to take vacations during school holidays . smaller pensions for women worse career opportunities are n't the only result of women staying at home with their children .
they also get smaller pensions since they contribute less money to the funds during their working lives .
on average , they receive about 40 percent less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're probably getting less pension than men their age .
while there are ways to augment pensions by signing up with private insurers , many women choose not to do so , according to ulrike rust , who teaches labor law at bremen university . " many households in germany are hopelessly in debt and when i tell them , ' you have to decide between setting aside money for your pension and buying your kids new boots for christmas , ' women will most often go for the boots , " rust said .
" giving people the option of augmenting their pension is something for people who have a lot of money , but does n't really help those who are already in debt .

following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week . according to a poll by german business daily handelsblatt , engineering giant siemens , automaker porsche and other well-known names of german industry are considering lengthening the work week for employees in research and development departments to 40 hours .
daimlerchrysler was the first to announce it will take advantage of last month 's new collective wage agreement reached between employers and the powerful ig metall engineering and metal workers union that allows for the extension of working hours for some employees if the company 's workers ' council agrees to it .
before the latest agreement , the standard working week was set at 35 hours and no more than 18 percent of employees could work an additional five hours a week .
the current agreement allows that percentage to go up to 50 percent , provided that more than half of the total number of employees at a location are " especially qualified " and earn on average € 4,500 -lrb- $ 5,566 -rrb- per month .
the extended hours must be accompanied by compensatory wage increases .
in the town of sindelfingen , near stuttgart , daimlerchrysler has its largest german facility , where some 10,000 of the 40,000 employees there work in development and production planning .
daimlerchrysler management has said it will apply for all of these highly skilled employers to add an extra five hours to their weekly time cards .
the local worker 's council has said it will agree to the request .
during the wage agreement talks last month , employers and the ig metall union said the new rules would help secure existing jobs and create new ones .
unions are showing more flexibility in labor agreements in the face of high unemployment .
the jobless rate in germany rose dramatically in february to a seasonally adjusted rate of 10.3 percent .
economists have welcomed the new agreement , saying it will improve the competitiveness of german companies .
jumping on the bandwagon siemens is currently holding talks with its workers ' council , hoping to follow daimler 's lead .
the introduction of the 40-hour week will be decided at each plant location , as appropriate , according to a company spokesperson .
no decisions have yet been reached .
porsche has said it wants to extend the working week for 3,000 of its employees in its development center and plans on starting talks with its employees ' councils in the near future .
company head wendelin wiedeking is expected to introduce a fourth series to the porsche family , and a longer week would help with increased development needs .
other companies related to the auto industry , have expressed interest in the expanded hours .
tire maker continental and electronics company bosch , both subcontractors to the auto industry , are considering asking some workers to put in more hours .
some bosch employees at research and development locations already work a longer week , thanks to a special agreement the company hammered out with ig metall in 2002 .
a company spokesman said it will now look at extending workers ' hours at other sites . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de union and employers agree to wage deal germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday .

the yuan is fixed at 8.28 to the us dollar , a low rate which many in the us say costs us jobs .
but despite the us 's feverish diplomacy and loud complaints , the peg is here to stay for " a long time to come " , china 's top foreign exchange official said .
the announcement follows a shift in economic policy to slow down growth and focus on helping the rural poor .
the low level of the yuan is widely believed to have contributed to a blistering 9.1 % growth rate last year - a rate which the government now fears is overheating and imbalancing the economy .
a new target of 7 % for 2004 was set on friday by prime minister wen jiabao , in the hope of avoiding a " boom and bust " cycle .
' enormous price ' in comments quoted across the chinese media , state administration of foreign exchange head guo shuqing was scathing about the accusations that china 's trade is getting an unfair advantage from the yuan .

" china 's managed floating exchange rate system conforms to the realities of china , and it will continue for a long time to come . "
it was china 's low wages , not the cheapness of its currency , that gave it a head-start , he insisted .
he also warned companies betting on an early shift and buying that they would suffer for it .
" anyone betting on a yuan appreaciation is likely to pay an enormous price , " he said .

' enormous price ' in comments quoted across the chinese media , state administration of foreign exchange head guo shuqing was scathing about the accusations that china 's trade is getting an unfair advantage from the yuan .
new economic goals growth of 7 % , down from 9.1 % in 2003 cut taxes on farmers over next 5 years spend $ 1.2bn on schooling in poor west for military , develop new , high tech weaponry improve public health and sanitation " our study shows that the impact of the exchange rate on the economy and employment has been over-exaggerated , " he said .
" china 's managed floating exchange rate system conforms to the realities of china , and it will continue for a long time to come . "
it was china 's low wages , not the cheapness of its currency , that gave it a head-start , he insisted .
he also warned companies betting on an early shift and buying that they would suffer for it .
" anyone betting on a yuan appreaciation is likely to pay an enormous price , " he said .

the launch of alfa romeo 's crosswagon marked the start of a high visibility strategy that will involve a string of new models from this sporty italian over the next few years .
the car makes it clear that alfa is gunning for the upmarket sports utility vehicle segment which traditionally has been dominated by butch americans , brits and germans .
its approach , though , is different .
during the launch , alfa executive and engineer paolo massai insisted that the crosswagon was " beautiful and delicate on the outside " , leaving the impression that it would be devilish in bed with its " perfect balance between oversteering and understeering " .

fiat needs sorting out , and fast , having seen a sharp fall in customer loyalty in its key home market .
and it is not only the italians who are deserting fiat , lancia and alfa romeo .
across europe , the company 's market share has been on the slide for years .
last year alone , sales fell almost 9 % from the previous year which had also been very disappointing .
action it would be extreme to suggest that italy 's entire automotive industry is on the line , though clearly there is more at stake than mr demel 's career .
fiat trepiuno : art on wheels ?
mr demel was not even the first choice for the job .
mr demel replaced giancarlo boschetti in the top job after former ford executive martin leach was prevented from doing so due to an anti competition clause in his contract with the us car maker .
but he quickly went to work , reining in fiat 's european operations and ditching a string of national executives in the process .
germany and france were the first to feel the pinch , with spain and the uk expected to be next on his list as mr demel tightened the grip .
and judging by some of the latest models from fiat auto , it seems he is being effective on the car front too .
sex appeal take fiat 's retro styled trepiuno concept car which lovingly recreates the image of the 500 bubble car .
mr demel : cautiously optimistic this is art on wheels that brings high hopes for the car maker 's future .
and then there is lancia 's new musa people carrier which with its elegance should go a long way to win back the hearts and minds of the italian people .
lancia is aiming for 30,000 sales per year as it targets the high-end mpv market that has been carved out by german car makers , according to managing director fabrizio longo .
and it might just work , given that musa 's flamboyance should appeal to italian men in tailored suits who youthfully sport slightly long hair .
never before has it been this trendy to be a middle aged father with bundles of bambinos in the back of a small bus .
it seems even the comment made by miss switzerland 2003 , bianca sissing - who had been hired by lancia to bring glamour to their marque - failed to dent their confidence .
-lrb- she told journalists during press day that her favourite car was a jaguar . -rrb-
gloomy but the confidence displayed by the executive posturing at the show - where bespoke chaps were surrounded by scantily clad , drowsy eyed women - is far from matched at corporate level .
a slew of new models should indeed bring about a rise in sales , though not a massive one , predicted a somewhat sombre mr demel .
sales would rise " less than 10 % " this year , mr demel said in an unusual display of modesty , and certainly not one that is expected at a show where everyone else are banging their drums as best as they can .
surely , if you can not sex up your message at a motor show , then when can you step up on the soap box ?

and it might just work , given that musa 's flamboyance should appeal to italian men in tailored suits who youthfully sport slightly long hair .
never before has it been this trendy to be a middle aged father with bundles of bambinos in the back of a small bus .
it seems even the comment made by miss switzerland 2003 , bianca sissing - who had been hired by lancia to bring glamour to their marque - failed to dent their confidence .
-lrb- she told journalists during press day that her favourite car was a jaguar . -rrb-
gloomy but the confidence displayed by the executive posturing at the show - where bespoke chaps were surrounded by scantily clad , drowsy eyed women - is far from matched at corporate level .
a slew of new models should indeed bring about a rise in sales , though not a massive one , predicted a somewhat sombre mr demel .
sales would rise " less than 10 % " this year , mr demel said in an unusual display of modesty , and certainly not one that is expected at a show where everyone else are banging their drums as best as they can .
surely , if you can not sex up your message at a motor show , then when can you step up on the soap box ?

the firm , home of the airbus passenger jets , overtook us arch-rival boeing during the year for the first time in airbus ' three-decade history .
the achievement - driven by a late surge in deliveries - helped it to net profits of 152m euros -lrb- $ 188m ; £ 102m -rrb- .
eads and boeing both suffered following the 11 september attacks in the us , but eads has recovered more quickly .
operating profits , a closely-watched statistic in the business , was up 8 % to 1.54bn euros , well ahead of expectations .
change of fortunes the results show a sharp turnaround not only from 2002 , when results were hampered by heavy charges for restructuring , but also from the first half of 2003 .
the company delivered fewer planes between january and june than in the previous year , as the travel industry suffered both from concerns about the war in iraq and from the sars virus in asia .
but later that year the recovery came , with more than a third of its 305 aircraft being delivered between october and december .
in contrast , boeing has laid off thousands of staff and cut its production line back .
the year ahead , eads said , would be boosted by strong demand in defence - thanks to new helicopter and missile projects - and renewed strength in building satellites and space vehicles .

" i am therefore urging the scottish executive to conduct research to determine the number of trafficked women in scotland and to consider establishing dedicated refuge and support services for such women . "

about 350 workers at kellingley colliery near pontefract were on a 24-hour stoppage .
mine owners uk coal want to increase kellingley 's operating hours to accommodate 240 miners from the selby mines which will be shortly closed .
the national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- has called a similar 24-hour stoppage for thursday .
' flexible working ' when the strike date was announced , chris kitchen , the num branch secretary , told bbc look north : " the strike is the last-ditch attempt to try and get the company to ditch their plans for what they call ' flexible working ' .
" we did not want to go into this course of action . "
uk coal wants to increase kellingley 's operating hours from 95 to 145 a week .
the company said this would bring kellingley in line with the working arrangements currently used by miners at selby .
but the num says this would result in men working 12 hour shifts in " hostile conditions " underground .

the electoral commission launched its advertising campaign on monday to remind people of rolling registration , which means that the electoral register is updated monthly .
the closing date for registration is 8 april .
seamus magee of the electoral commission said young people , students and people with disabilities were being targeted in particular by the campaign .
it emerged last month that the new northern ireland electoral register was down by more than 28,000 electors compared to the one used in last year 's assembly elections .
just over one million people have registered .
negative impact a report in december last year said measures to combat voting fraud in northern ireland had a negative impact on young people and those in poorer areas .
the electoral commission said this measure tended to have an adverse impact on disadvantaged , marginalised and hard to reach groups .
the report also called for a review of the special hearings procedure for those who want to be added to the electoral register .
the need to register every year was brought in by the electoral fraud act 2002 .
in the past , one form was given to every household , but now everyone has to register individually .
the four main parties in northern ireland have now chosen their candidates to stand in the 10 june election .

stripping out the sales proceeds and other one-off items , profits were down 4 % to £ 3.38bn.

over the past year , lloyds tsb has sold the national bank of new zealand , many of its businesses in brazil and its french operations .
it has also sold its central american businesses and emerging markets portfolio .
" we have removed significant earnings volatility and are now more focused on our core franchises , " the bank said .
the re-emphasis on its core activities had resulted in " robust " results from its uk retail banking and mortgage business , the bank added .
pre-tax profits at the business were up 1 % to £ 1.02bn , and up 21 % if a £ 200m provision for customer compensation is excluded .
credit card balances were up 18 % and gross new mortgage lending jumped 27 % to an all-time high of £ 24.2bn.

uk trade unions have traditionally been strongest in the old manufacturing industries like steel , coal , printing , the docks , and engineering -lrb- e.g. car manufacture -rrb- .
biggest unions t & g 1980:2m 2000:0.7m * gmb 1980:0.9m 2000:0.7m * unison 1980:1.6m 2000:1.3m * significant mergers source : tuc but by the l970s these were all industries in decline , and the recession of the l980s accelerated their demise , with millions of manufacturing jobs lost .
according to richard hyman , professor of industrial relations at the london school of economics , " another factor was the tougher competitive environment in which an anti-union stance seemed an attractive option to employers " .
union membership peaked in 1979 , but in fact the number of strikes had been declining in the l970s as well , from around 5,000 a year in 1970 to 1,500 by l979 .
the difficult economic climate , and the decline of piecework bargaining -lrb- which had encouraged strikes -rrb- , all contributed to this decline .
militant clashes alienated public support since the late 1990s , the decline in union membership has levelled off , with new laws and a renewed organisational drive by the unions keeping their numbers at around 8 million .
new types of unions but it is a very different union movement from the 1970s , even if the numbers are about the same .
the biggest long-term change in the union movement has been the rise of the public sector unions , whose membership has been less affected by economic difficulties .
david bradbury of the office of national statistics says that the typical union member now is likely to be a skilled professional or technician working in the public sector .
union membership by occupation professional male 36 % female 60 % technical male 37 % female : 46 % skilled trades male 30 % female 25 % plant operatives male 38 % female 27 % sales male 13 % female 13 % personal service male : 37 % female : 30 % source : labour force survey , ons in 2002 , 29 % of the workforce was in unions , but 60 % of female professionals unionised , as compared to 38 % of male process plant workers .
the weakest sector for unionism , however , is the fast-growing private service sector , with only 13 % of sales and customer service workers in unions .
the change has meant that the big industrial unions like the transport and general workers union , the gmb and the aeeu suffered big membership losses , while unions in teaching , nursing , and local government have seen gains , despite a series of mergers among unions .
and in recent years it has been the public sector which has been the most militant in terms of strike action .
arthur scargill refused to compromise but fewer young people are in unions , with one-third of those over 50 in unions , compared to quarter of those aged 25 to 34 .
according to professor hyman , " being a union member has ceased to be the social norm , and a new generation has grown up who not only are not trade unionists , but whose parents have never been in unions either . "
new outlook another big change has been in the political and economic outlook of the unions .
as their bargaining power weakened , unions sought new means of influence , and the " new realism " took hold , looking for partnership rather than confrontation with employers .
and , according to professor hyman , this also weakened the power of local union activists like shop stewards , and unions adopted a more " strategic " use of power , where strike were the last resort , not the first course of action .
all these changes would have happened without the miners ' strike , according to professor hyman , but perhaps more slowly .
the unions have attempted to regain some of their influence within the labour party , but they have found that although they can win votes at party conferences , they can not necessarily change policy .
and their complex bargaining relationship with the government is paralleled by the complicated negotiations over additional union rights in the private sector .
although unions have gained some recognition rights and a minimum wage , tony blair 's labour party has made it clear that there will be no return to the legal immunities that they enjoyed before 1980 .
so it may be that it is in relation to the labour party , rather than in terms of industrial bargaining power , that the biggest changes have occurred .
politics , it seems , rather than economics , was always in the driving seat .

the miner 's strike has been seen as the decisive political moment in the confrontation between the conservative government of mrs thatcher and the power of militant trade unionism .
mrs thatcher 's careful preparation before confronting the miners led to an overwhelming victory , vindicating her policy of mine closures and privatisation .

the unions have attempted to regain some of their influence within the labour party , but they have found that although they can win votes at party conferences , they can not necessarily change policy .
and their complex bargaining relationship with the government is paralleled by the complicated negotiations over additional union rights in the private sector .
although unions have gained some recognition rights and a minimum wage , tony blair 's labour party has made it clear that there will be no return to the legal immunities that they enjoyed before 1980 .
