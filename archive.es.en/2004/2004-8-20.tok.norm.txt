program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2004 € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobless people may help out community organizations to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed . the program would be designed to help long-term unemployed facing benefit cuts to augment their monthly government check with extra income .
germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

three new brigades will come to germany despite plans for a broad withdrawal of cold war-era deployments . senior us commander general charles wald said the united states will keep its european command in germany , adding three new brigades - a new , mobile brigade using lighter stryker armored vehicles , a paratrooper brigade , and an expeditionary brigade .
each brigade will number between 3,000 and 5,000 troops . " the real issue is not the percentage of troops leaving , so much as there will still be a significant capability left here , and it will be transformed to be more mobile , more light , and more responsive , " wald said at a news conference at european command headquarters in stuttgart . wald also said some bases in germany , such as the ramstein air base in the west of the country , would be expanded , despite plans to withdraw some 30,000 troops currently stationed here .
another base at spangdahlem , home to two us f-16 squadrons , will remain as well , wald said . us president george w. bush announced the withdrawal on monday , as part of plans to completely restructure us military deployments around the world to better fight terrorism . stryker location to be decided wald said the location of the stryker brigade still needs to be negotiated with the german government , though there are rumors that it will be based at the us training range near the bavarian town of grafenwöhr . the withdrawal of thousands of soldiers from the two heavy divisions in germany - the 1st armored based in wiesbaden and the 1st infantry based in würzburg - will not happen before 2006 , so that the views of the german government can be heard , wald said . the news of the withdrawals caused dismay in many of the communities that evolved around the us army bases , as the livelihoods of many german residents depend on the soldiers ' presence . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing " the boys " the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .
on wednesday , he simply said , " germany has the right to a seat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .
on wednesday , he simply said , " germany has the right to a seat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .

combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .

he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .

but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .

germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .

though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?

his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?

his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .

the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .

clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "

prime minister medgyessy is likely to be replaced by peter kiss , a former labor minister and a senior figure in the ruling socialist party , according to reuters .
tensions between the two ruling groups in the hungarian government , the socialists and the liberal free democrats , grew in recent weeks , and wednesday the prime minister sacked three ministers , including economics minister istvan csillag a member of the junior coalition party .
the government has been divided over how to best govern the country after joining the european union .
the socialists lost heavily in june 's european parliament elections and many in the party want to see a more popular economic policy to catch up with the opposition conservatives , who are poised to win the next election in 2006 .

a survey looking at environment law in 2003 found there were 88 instances in which environment rules had not been made into national law on time .
" implementation of eu law is bad .
i hope the survey 's findings will give member states reason to improve their record , " environment commissioner margot wallström said .
france is the worst offender of the 15 " old " member states , which are the only ones covered by the report .
it 's at the bottom of the league both for missing deadlines and for incorrectly transposing eu environment law .
by contrast , nordic countries are the best behaved of the bunch .
at the top of the class is denmark , followed closely by sweden and finland .
the report said that laws relating to water , waste , nature protection and environmental impact assessments had been the most neglected by member states .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?

his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .

twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .

in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

three new brigades will come to germany despite plans for a broad withdrawal of cold war-era deployments . senior us commander general charles wald said the united states will keep its european command in germany , adding three new brigades - a new , mobile brigade using lighter stryker armored vehicles , a paratrooper brigade , and an expeditionary brigade .
each brigade will number between 3,000 and 5,000 troops . " the real issue is not the percentage of troops leaving , so much as there will still be a significant capability left here , and it will be transformed to be more mobile , more light , and more responsive , " wald said at a news conference at european command headquarters in stuttgart . wald also said some bases in germany , such as the ramstein air base in the west of the country , would be expanded , despite plans to withdraw some 30,000 troops currently stationed here .
another base at spangdahlem , home to two us f-16 squadrons , will remain as well , wald said . us president george w. bush announced the withdrawal on monday , as part of plans to completely restructure us military deployments around the world to better fight terrorism . stryker location to be decided wald said the location of the stryker brigade still needs to be negotiated with the german government , though there are rumors that it will be based at the us training range near the bavarian town of grafenwöhr . the withdrawal of thousands of soldiers from the two heavy divisions in germany - the 1st armored based in wiesbaden and the 1st infantry based in würzburg - will not happen before 2006 , so that the views of the german government can be heard , wald said . the news of the withdrawals caused dismay in many of the communities that evolved around the us army bases , as the livelihoods of many german residents depend on the soldiers ' presence . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing " the boys " the planned withdrawal of thousands of us troops from germany has many communities worried about the economic consequences .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .

germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .

" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .

a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .

his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .

with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .

they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2004 € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobless people may help out community organizations to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed . the program would be designed to help long-term unemployed facing benefit cuts to augment their monthly government check with extra income .
germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2004 € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobless people may help out community organizations to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed . the program would be designed to help long-term unemployed facing benefit cuts to augment their monthly government check with extra income .
germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .

clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution .

" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2004 € 1 jobs for germany 's unemployed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobless people may help out community organizations to ease the pain of its new unemployment benefit cuts , germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , has floated a proposal to create so-called one-euro community jobs for the long-term unemployed . the program would be designed to help long-term unemployed facing benefit cuts to augment their monthly government check with extra income .
germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .
" i 'm showing them that older people are still fit , still good-looking and still intelligent . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de help yourself before the state does how will germans live in 2020 ?

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso wants to expand the eu 's budget by € 43 billion incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan . on the eve of the first meeting of the incoming european commission , the body 's designated president said in a series of broad interviews that he will follow the policies of predecessor romano prodi , including plans to increase the eu budget .
his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .

but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?

his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .

germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .

manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .
" i 'm showing them that older people are still fit , still good-looking and still intelligent . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de help yourself before the state does how will germans live in 2020 ?

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .
on wednesday , he simply said , " germany has the right to a seat .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .

clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.08.2004 eu commission to focus on economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso wants to make europe no. 1 in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .
its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "
the commission 's main priority will be to promote the lisbon strategy , which aims to make europe the world 's most competitive economic bloc by 2010 .
european leaders agreed to the strategy at an eu summit in lisbon in 2000 .
the current commission has largely failed to spark the initiatives necessary to ensure lisbon 's success .
barroso and his new commission are hoping to change that , but the future president has said he was doubtful the goal could be achieved by 2010 .
though it is already planning its strategy , the incoming european commission still faces questions from the european parliament , which must still confirm the composition of the commission . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's budget could create rift with berlin incoming european commission president jose barroso says he wants to dramatically increase the eu 's budget , but berlin , struggling with its own budget deficit , has adamantly resisted the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .

even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .

germany 's new hartz v labor law does not stipulate how much workers should be paid for the jobs , but clement has suggested that welfare recipients be paid one to two euros per hour .
according to clement 's calculations , the jobs could help someone on reduced benefits earn an additional € 850 to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 985 to $ 1,230 -rrb- per month .
but some critics , including michael fertig , research coordinator at the rhine-westphalian institute for economic research in essen , believe clement 's numbers are " unrealistic . "
relief or a pipe dream ?
combined with the benefits that will remain in place , the jobs could help take some of the sting out of the planned welfare cuts , which have led hundreds of thousands of germans in the eastern part of the country to take to the streets in protest in recent weeks .
under the new law , long-term unemployed who refuse jobs can have their welfare benefits reduced .
if a person is under 25 years of age , the government can cut all support except the monthly housing reimbursement and non-cash benefits .
a person is required to take any legal job .
a special morality clause , however , ensures that unemployed will not be forced into prostitution - which is legal and regulated in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement is turning up every stone he can find in the desperate search for work for germany 's more than 4 million jobless the program envisions work being offered by community job creation companies and non-profit organizations .
clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said the jobs could include anything that would not put the organizations in direct competition with the local private economy and labor market .
he suggested aids in kindergartens , in gardening , landscaping or city clean-up work or care for the elderly as examples of possible one-euro jobs .
according to clement 's plan , the jobs would be limited to six months .
nevertheless , critics , like angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democratic union , warn that even those jobs will provide unwanted competition and create a shadow labor market that will pit itself against a " carefully established primary labor market . "
support from charity groups german charity organizations are already lining up behind the proposal , including caritas and the diakonisches werk of the protestant church , which have said they are interested in creating one-euro jobs .
" i 'm counting on a considerable strengthening of public work opportunities , " with as many as 20 percent -lrb- as many as 600,000 -rrb- of today 's long-term unemployed working in the program , an optimistic clement told the germany daily die welt earlier this week .
but the german association of municipalities found fault in the plan and dismissed it as " wishful thinking . "
a spokesman for the organization , franz-reinhard habbel , told the web site tagesschau.de that close to 350,000 germans are employed in the types of jobs clement has proposed and that he sees " little potential for further jobs . "
nonetheless , habbel said his organization would do what it could to find potential one-euro jobs .
" our members are going through their institutions to see where they can create additional jobs .
but it 's an illusion that every fifth long-term unemployed person is going to helped in this way , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

" it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2004 german hopes for un security council seat dampened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un might not make room for germany in its inner circle until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .
on wednesday , he simply said , " germany has the right to a seat .

his political course could throw him into a conflict path with germany .
in interviews with leading european newspapers on thursday , former portuguese prime minister jose barroso said : " my starting off point will be the proposal that the prodi commission made . "
in february , the commission suggested increasing the eu 's budget during the period between 2007 to 2013 from the current level of around € 100 billion annually to € 143.1 billion -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- .
the increase could represent an eu fee increase for germany in the double-digit billions , and berlin , as well as the other five so-called net payers of the eu have categorically refused the proposal .
net payers in the eu , like germany and the netherlands , pay more into brussels than they get back .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner günter verheugen in the lead-up to the meeting , germany 's eu commissioner , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , said on friday that he believed brussels and berlin would ultimately reach a compromise over the budget .
" the commission has produced its proposal for the upcoming budget , which forsees a considerable increase , " he said .
but , he added , the council of ministers is already negotiating what the exact figure will be and that there will " certainly be a compromise . "
bringing the east up to standard in his interviews , barroso said the additional spending was needed following the eu 's may expansion , which brought 10 new , mostly former eastern bloc countries , into the fold .
" we 're making a big mistake if we see money that is given to the new member states as lost , " barroso said , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
barroso also pointed to the stated eu goal of raising living standards in the new member states as justification for a budget increase .
" europe can not have ambitious policies with insufficient money , " he said , adding that politicians in the eu member states must explain to their constituents that everyone will profit from the increased budget spending .
in germany , some fear barroso could be on a conflict course with berlin that will present myriad conflicts of policy interest .
just last week , after barroso introduced the members and unveiled the competencies of his new commission , which takes office november 1 , chancellor gerhard schröder said he felt their would be fewer conflicts with the body , which is the eu 's executive .
fuel for deficit disputes ?
but barroso 's strong comments on the budget coupled with a coming battle over the reform of the stability and growth pact that regulates the euro , europe 's common currency , show that in reality , there could be rough waters ahead .
germany and france , along with other eu countries that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately have pleaded for a looser interpretation of the pact 's rules , which prohibit yearly budget deficits from exceeding 3 percent of a country 's gross domestic product .
the new commission president said he is also dedicated to promoting the eu 's plan to become the most competitive economic zone in the world by 2010 .
however , he said the deadline may have to get pushed back a bit .
" i think we should do as much as possible to come near that goal .
it was a very ambitious goal and many consider it too ambitious , " he said .
the eu member states committed themselves to the goal , cemented in the so-called lisbon agenda , at an eu summit four years ago .
now , barroso says he wants to make it a central issue of his presidency .
though barroso said there was " greater awareness of competitive problems than there was -lrb- in the past -rrb- , " he said he would still ask member states whether they want to postpone the target date .
" the goal of becoming the most competitive economy in the world is one we can achieve and we should not feel discouraged , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .
" i 'm showing them that older people are still fit , still good-looking and still intelligent . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de help yourself before the state does how will germans live in 2020 ?

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "

its policies will promote the economy , but its budget line could put it on a crash course with berlin . the european commission of jose manuel barroso may be new , but its disputes are the same as those of past commissions .
like his predecessor , romano prodi , barroso is demanding a dramatic increase in the european union 's annual budget .
in a newspaper interview published on friday , the day of the first meeting , the future president said member states should fork over 1.14 percent of their gross domestic product to brussels , a move that would increase the eu 's annual budget from today 's approximate € 100 billion -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- to € 140 billion by 2013 . such a change would require netpayer countries like germany to dig far deeper into their pockets .
on friday , germany 's member of the commission , günter verheugen , criticized the calls for additional money .
though he said he would respect the incoming president 's stance , he added that there was also a group of member states - together representing more than 70 percent of the -lrb- eu 's -rrb- budget resources - that would call for a reduction in the overall budget .
the commissioner said he predicted " long and difficult negotiations " but a compromise in the end .
berlin repeats call for budget freeze but so far , no agreement is in sight .
some officials in berlin have raised their eyebrows over barroso 's assertion that some of the eu 's netpayers are n't serious about their refusal to back the commission 's increased budget plans .
barroso told reporters several european leaders had signaled to him that the refusal was an act of tactical positioning and not to be taken too seriously .
six of the eu 's net payers , so called because they pay more into the union than they get back , have demanded the brussel 's budget be capped at 1 percent of gdp .
" i declare there is no reason to change anything about the position of the german government , which is also the position of the five other netpayers , france , great britain , sweden , the netherlands and austria , " said bela anda , spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
during their first meeting on friday , the 25 members of the new european commission agreed to a strict code of professional conduct that , among other things , prohibits commissioners from doing any other work outside the commission .
the current commission operates according to a similar code of conduct created following corruption scandal that triggered mass resignations in 1999 .
it 's the economy , stupid !
germany 's verheugen praised the set of priorities agreed to by the commission on friday .
" my impression of this meeting is that it 's extremely positive , " verheugen said .
" all of the participants are clear on the work that lies ahead of us , which is mainly to improve the reputation of the institutions , reduce its distance to the citizens of europe and to concentrate on several truly decisive issues - especially in areas involving the economy . "

now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . until this week , the possibility of germany gaining a permanent seat on the un security council looked good .
now , a plan to reform the international organization could put the brakes on that ambition . in march , german chancellor gerhard schröder made it perfectly clear that his country hoped to gain a permanent seat on the un security council when he said germany was ready to " take on more responsibility . "
a permanent seat would be the culmination of a dream to join the ranks of the world 's leading nations born at the time of german reunification in 1990 . the likelihood of achieving that goal was bolstered by un secretary general kofi annan 's intention to make institutional reform one of the top priorities of his time in office .
many thought germany 's hour had come .
as the third largest net contributor to the organization and the second largest contributor of troops to un-mandated missions , germany , many said , had a right to more of a say . however , this week rumors of a plan originating from a committee based in palo alto , california that was established to propose reforms has dampened hopes - much to the dismay of german experts and leadership . according to a report in the thursday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the committee - whose plans are due to be unveiled at the end of august - is gearing up to propose a three-tier model : the five current permanent members would remain in the top spot , while countries like germany and japan , who for years have been vying for membership in the first league of the international community , would alternately serve five-year terms on the security council .
the remaining members of the un would be relegated to the third rung - two-year stints on the body . a " sham " the plan is a " sham " that only scratches the surface of the exceptional position allotted to the permanent members with their veto powers , professor berthold meyer of the hessen-based endowment for peace and conflict studies told dw-world . manuel fröhlich of the german association for the united nations is was equally critical , calling the three-tier plan a " minimal solution . "
" this will annoy the majority of the members , including those ambitious countries with an eye on a permanent seat and the rest , who will be relegated to the third league , " he says .
fröhlich also predicted that the classic rivalry between german and italy would not be addressed . fröhlich harkened back to the original goal of the reform effort , which was intended to find a way to bestow more legitimacy on decisions by adding geographic diversity to the council .
this plan , he said , would relegate the southern hemisphere to the cheap seats , missing the point of reform entirely . alternative solutions the process of finding a plan all members will agree to is fraught with difficulties . as an alternative to the three-tier model , meyer favored the transfer of more competency to the general assembly in instances where the security council is at an impasse .
or , said meyer , a collective eu-seat could be created in the security council , though he admited that britain and france were not likely to trade their individual seats for a collective european one . fröhlich , in contrast , favored enlarging the security council to ten members , to the benefit of germany , japan and others from southeast asia , africa and latin america .
furthermore , he said the concept of the veto should be reconsidered .
" countries invoking the veto should be required to state and defend their reasons , or the veto of two members should be required to block a resolution , " said fröhlich . meanwhile , the chancellor has made his views on the three-tier plan perfectly clear .

but as germany 's population ages , advertisers are increasingly using older models to tap into a target group with money to spend - seniors . in the headquarters of the senior models berlin agency , there 's a poster on the wall featuring a vampire-like figure , eyes glazed over in a startling light blue .
" senior models is coming to get you , " reads the caption below the zombie . the poster sums up the business philosophy of the agency 's owner , nicola siegel , who opened senior models berlin last year . " the trend -lrb- towards senior models -rrb- is just starting .
over the next 10 to 20 years , judging from the demographic statistics , it 's only going to grow .
it 's good business , " she told dw-world . demographic revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society is ageing germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is under way .
with fewer babies being born and many young , qualified people moving abroad in search of jobs , experts predict that by the middle of the century , more than half the german population will be over the age of 65 . siegel says companies would be well-advised to start targeting their advertising campaigns at the population segment that now has the greatest economic power in germany - senior citizens . " the older people are the only generation with money in their pockets , " she explained .
" younger people are afraid of losing their jobs and are holding on to their money .
years ago , it was different - older people saved their money , and young people were out shopping and spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model with senior models berlin : proof that older women are still sexy on her desk , siegel has a red leather binder filled with the set cards of her models .
around 70 percent are actors , she says , because in the senior models business , clients want faces with character , not blank canvases with perfect features .
twenty percent are professional models , and the rest are what she calls " new faces " - ordinary people who flood her office with around 40 applications a day , looking to earn some extra cash as senior models . flipping through the set cards , there are some noticeable " senior " types - people with grey hair and wrinkles around the eyes .
but many do n't look a day over 29 .
that 's because they 're not .
in the youth-obsessed modelling industry , " senior " starts at 30 . " i have many attractive models from all over germany who are around 30 and were looking for a big agency .
they have good photos , but all the agencies told them they were too old .
so these models are in my agency , " siegel said . when looking for a model , advertisers generally want someone 10 years younger than their intended target group because , as siegel explains , people like to see models who look the age they feel - not the age they actually are . companies slow to react but does that mean 50- , 60- and even 70-year-old models will start replacing their twenty-something colleagues on billboards and magazine covers ? " it 's going to happen , but it 's going to take quite a while , " said ulf heuer of senioragency , a network of agencies dedicated to the 50 + market .
" one of the reasons is that , on average , people working in advertising agencies are much younger , so they 're not in a position to think and feel the way older people do . " heuer added that companies have been slow to respond to the demographic changes . " they 've snored away for years , " heuer said .
" about a year ago , the media started catching on , reporting about the pensions crisis .
major manufacturers were interested in the topic , but when it came to the question of working with senioragency , they hesitated , saying they did n't have money to split their brand or address this new target group . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo : senior-models-berlin , 2004 eventually though , companies and advertising agencies will go where the money is .
and when that happens , siegel predicts a redefinition of beauty ideals and the image of older people in german society . " ten or 15 years ago , people looked their age , but now , that 's changed .
that 's one of my main problems with clients .
i send them a 65-year-old model , and they call me up saying she looks too young , " siegel says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.08.2004 " energy passports " for german homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the program aims to make energy consumption more transparent under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .
german pilot programs got underway this week . ulrike leidinger has witnessed dispute after dispute between landlords and tenants over utility costs .
the fights usually begin about a year after new renters move in , the energy consultant at the consumer center in aachen told dpa news service .
" after one year , they get totally upset when they receive their bill for heating costs and have to pay a lot more than they had estimated , " she said .
each year , the consumer center receives hundreds of complaints from renters over utility costs .
with the introduction in germany of a new law requiring " energy passports " for home and apartment owners , the government is hoping to create more transparency vis-a-vis potential energy costs .
the legislation follows regulation from the european commission in 2003 that requires the passports in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency .
under the regulations , due to take effect in 2006 , landlords will have to present an energy passport with information about a home or apartment 's energy efficiency and costs before the contract is signed by a renter or buyer .
the energy certificate is intended to give renters or potential buyers the information they need to determine whether a home is energy-efficient or potentially energy eating .
pilot program currently the consumer centers in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , working for the german energy agency , are carrying out a pilot program in 10 cities that is serving as a prototype for what will happen in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an award-winning energy conserving house in stuttgart as part of the project , which began this week , the centers will locate 100 homeowners in the region willing to undergo the so-called " energy check . "
the inspection covers the building 's frame and anything that could effect energy efficiency , like windows , masonry , ceilings and the condition of the heating system .
all of the data is then poured into a new computer program that then processes it and produces a grade ranking for the building 's energy efficiency .
" we 're hoping that this will finally help make rents a little more transparent , " leidinger said .
north rhine-westphalia 's environment minister , bärbel höhn , said the passports would do for homes what so-called tüv inspections have done for cars .
" every car-owner knows exactly how much gas his car uses , " she said , according to berlin 's tageszeitung newspaper .
" but the high energy costs of an apartment or house are mostly unknown . "
but others are n't sold on the idea .
germany 's main homeowner 's association , haus & grund , has rejected the energy passport requirement , saying it runs counter to the government 's stated deregulation plans .
" starting in 2006 , close to 2 million energy passports will be issued at a price of up to € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,230 -rrb- each , " said the association 's energy policy spokesman , detlef manger , dpa reported .
manger added that the additional financial burden on homeowners would make them less motivated to invest in modernization measures to make their building 's more efficient .
good for renters and owners ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architekt mit bauherrin vor einem rohbau one of the first volunteers is reinhold weiss , a home owner in the town of aachen who registered his house to be part of the pilot program .
his 100-year-old building includes seven rental apartments .
" low energy costs interest renters , " he told dpa .
" our experience with renters is that they tend to ask about these things , " he added , citing the main reason for his participation .
despite its relatively old age , weiss ' building is partially insulated , but he has resisted remodeling the house 's facade .
" the house has a large number of windows .
would it really help if i remodeled it , " he asked himself , hoping that the energy check would help answer that question .
and that 's one of the plus sides of the inspections - like mandatory car checks , they also provide the owner with tips for modernizing the home and making it more efficient .
as one of the 10 test cities , aachen is approaching the project from the assumption that there are many others like weiss .
close to 80 percent of the homes in the city are over 25 years old , said energy expert maria vankann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a price-winning high-rise building in freiburg with solar cells " if all of those homes cut back on their energy consumption , it will improve the microclimate in the city , " which is surrounded by hills and thus has its own mini-greenhouse effect on bad days , vankann told dpa .
even before the city began advertising the new program , 25 people registered interest in the energy passport .
consumer consultants believe the inspection 's low price has made it attractive to homeowners .
the prices range from € 150 -lrb- $ 184 -rrb- for a two family house in aachen to as high as € 395 in the city of gütersloh , which is also part of the program .
but most observers believe the prices will increase when the program is rolled out nationally in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : for some german architects , it 's easy being green an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .

the dorset wildlife trust has succeeded in raising £ 200,000 from donations in just a fortnight in time for friday 's auction of land on the isle of purbeck .
it wants to buy four plots of land at creech , near wareham - around 120 acres including ancient woodland and meadows .
managers at the trust say they have been " amazed at the generosity " shown by people ringing to pledge money .

gloucester is believed to have the uk 's biggest infestation of gulls .
experts believe the birds have been driven inland to scavenge , due to a decline in fish guts being dumped at sea by trawlers .

a montana jury ordered the company to pay for the environmental damage from a gasoline pipeline leak in 1955 , the wall street journal reported .
the award could lead to more lawsuits against oil companies , legal experts told the newspaper .
the prosecution claimed chevron failed to adequately clean up the oil spill .
residents of sunburst argued that the leak at the old sunburst works refinery montana subsequently harmed public health and property values .
oil companies could face lawsuits for leftover contamination chevrontexaco says it pumped the ground clean for two years after the leak and it is still monitoring pollution levels .
state regulators agreed with the chevrontexaco assessment that there was no health risk .

a montana jury ordered the company to pay for the environmental damage from a gasoline pipeline leak in 1955 , the wall street journal reported .

the prosecution claimed chevron failed to adequately clean up the oil spill .
residents of sunburst argued that the leak at the old sunburst works refinery montana subsequently harmed public health and property values .
oil companies could face lawsuits for leftover contamination chevrontexaco says it pumped the ground clean for two years after the leak and it is still monitoring pollution levels .
state regulators agreed with the chevrontexaco assessment that there was no health risk .
however , the case indicates that other companies may have to pay damages if they too have been held responsible for leftover contamination from old refineries under the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act .

the chick , which hatched in may , flew this week for the first time .
the welsh wildlife trusts have kept the location of the nest under wraps to protect the safety of the chick and its parents .
only one other pair is known to have bred in wales , but their chicks died after the nest fell to the ground in high winds earlier this year .
" it is incredible news for wales , " said welsh wildlife trusts spokesman and life-long ornithologist derek moore .
osprey facts scientific name : pandion haliaetus wingspan : 5ft clutch : 3 , but not all fledge sexual maturity : three to five years diet : mainly fish , particularly perch , pike , and trout " what has happened goes against what all the text books say .
" male ospreys prefer to return from migration to the area where they were hatched , so it is really surprising that a male has settled so far away from the natal nest . "
identification rings on the legs of the new parents have shown that they are both originally scottish birds .
the female came from the black isle in the scottish highlands - but the male was one of those which had been relocated from scotland to the wildlife trust nature reserve at rutland water in the east midlands , where a project to reintroduce osprey began eight years ago .
more than 60 young birds were transferred to the reserve under special licence between 1996 and 2001 .
wildlife broadcaster iolo williams has praised all those involved in safeguarding the first successful fledgling and its parents .
what 's in a name ?
the greek name for the bird , pandion haliaetus , comes from the mythical king of athens , pandion , whose daughters were turned into birds , the greek words halos , which refers to the sea , and aetos , meaning an eagle the common name is from the latin word ossifragus , meaning ' a bone breaker ' " it is fantastic news that this pair has successfully bred and reared a chick , " he said .
" i really would like to take my hat off to the welsh wildlife trusts , the landowner , and the volunteers , who have handled the whole operation superbly well . "
osprey experts at rutland water are just as thrilled as their welsh counterparts about the first successful hatch in wales .
" everyone is delighted at the news , and it shows that the project has not just worked here , " said tim appleton , reserve manager at rutland water .
" we hoped our project would expand the population of ospreys throughout britain , but we did n't envisage it happening in wales quite so soon - we thought we were much more likely to see other parts of england being colonised first . "
the news of the first welsh fledgling has delighted naturalists everywhere who were bitterly disappointed that an earlier attempt to raise chicks at another site in wales ended in disaster in june .
delighted : derek moore of the welsh wildlife trusts a pair successfully bred at a site between porthmadog and beddgelert earlier this year .
the nest was built in a high tree and two chicks hatched .
sadly , bad weather swept away part of the nest , taking the chicks with it .
the male parent was another of the scottish birds released at rutland water in 1998 .
the osprey was persecuted to the brink of extinction in britain by gamekeepers and fishermen in victorian times .
it took until 1954 for birds to be spotted again in scotland .
although numbers have recovered considerably there , it remains an amber list species , which means it still needs protection for numbers to recover to an acceptable level .
the core population remains in scotland , where there are about 160 pairs , and some have spread to the north of england .
birds which were transferred from scotland have begun breeding successfully at rutland water , thanks to an ambitious reintroduction programme backed by leicestershire and rutland wildlife trust and anglian water .
there are hopes the parents will return next year osprey - which have a wingspan of up to 5ft - are among the biggest birds of prey in britain .
some have been seen in recent years flying across wales - as they travel to and from west africa , where they overwinter - there are no records of them having nested successfully here .
despite their increased numbers , osprey nests are still targets for egg thieves .
the rspb has logged more than 100 cases where clutches of eggs have been taken from uk nests .
collectors would have paid a premium to own the first osprey egg laid in wales , so strict security surrounded the birds in wales as they built their nest and brooded .
sadly , severe weather wrecked the nest and the chicks did not survive .
but , as osprey tend to return to their nests year after year , there are hopes that the pair will try again next spring .

the nest was built in a high tree and two chicks hatched .
sadly , bad weather swept away part of the nest , taking the chicks with it .
the male parent was another of the scottish birds released at rutland water in 1998 .
the osprey was persecuted to the brink of extinction in britain by gamekeepers and fishermen in victorian times .
it took until 1954 for birds to be spotted again in scotland .

despite their increased numbers , osprey nests are still targets for egg thieves .
the rspb has logged more than 100 cases where clutches of eggs have been taken from uk nests .
collectors would have paid a premium to own the first osprey egg laid in wales , so strict security surrounded the birds in wales as they built their nest and brooded .

pat bowles , who is president of the worldwide caspian horse society , runs a stud close to the lincolnshire border with rutland , where she keeps 16 of these distinctive animals .
the breed is the smallest in the world , standing from just 10 hands high and is making a reappearance , thanks to dna testing being carried out at bytham stud near castle bytham , by enthusiasts like ms bowles .
the caspian horse society recently gathered for its first world-wide conference in oakham , rutland .
louise firouz , who rediscovered a small herd of the horses in iran in 1965 , spoke to the society along with dr guy cothran , from kentucky , usa , who is conducting the dna tests .
there is strong evidence to claim that these small but strong animals were the original chariot horses from 3,000 years ago .
ms bowles told bbc news online how she came across the small horses by chance at the east of england show in peterborough .
caspian credentials small ears intelligent face big eyes fine legs bay , grey or chestnut coat " i 'd been breeding national hunt thoroughbred horses when i went to the show .
" it was pouring with rain and my friends and i ended up sheltering in an exhibition tent where the caspian horse society had a stand .
" i went home and sold all my thoroughbreds and bought three caspian mares instead . "
since then ms bowles has become a key player in the international breeding programme , with all of her horses participating in the dna testing scheme .
she described how they resurrected the breed .
