" we can and we must turn a page on this if we are friends and prepared to look each other in the eye , " he said in an interview with leading russian daily izvestia . yushchenko said he really did n't like the fact that " russia campaigned actively in favor of " his rival , prime minister viktor yanukovych .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 28.12.2004 yushchenko reaches out to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for the wronged viktor the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . ukraine 's top government officials on tuesday sided with western observers ' positive assessment of sunday 's presidential election , dismissing the judgment of russia-led monitors who said sunday 's re-run election was riddled with fraud just like the previous , now-discredited nov .
21 contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , 50 , who won the election according to official resultsafter leading the country 's " orange revolution , " said he would now focus on restoring relations with moscow in interviews with several russian dailies . " we can and we must turn a page on this if we are friends and prepared to look each other in the eye , " he said in an interview with leading russian daily izvestia . yushchenko said he really did n't like the fact that " russia campaigned actively in favor of " his rival , prime minister viktor yanukovych .
but , he acknowledged that ukraine and russia were closely bound , even if he planned to build closer ties with western europe . " kiev has to say openly that russia is our close neighbor , our strategic partner , and we need to integrate with it , .
but , the western market interests us and it does n't contradict our relations with moscow , " he told russian government daily rossiskaya gazeta . yanukovych questions rival 's victory yushchenko 's claim to victory in the election was bolstered tuesday as the central election commission released results based on reporting from all the country 's precincts showing that he took 51.99 percent of the vote compared to 44.19 percent for yanukovych . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that victory however can not be formally certified until legal challenges to it have been examined and the election commission issues a definitive declaration of his win .
yanukovych , who announced monday that he planned to contest the outcome of the weekend vote , continued to blame outsiders , particularly the united states , for his loss . " the american influence in the ukrainian elections was systematic and planned " and favored yushchenko , yanukovych said in a separate interview with izvestia .
" i consider that to be interference in ukraine 's internal affairs . " at the same time he also reiterated his plan to lead an opposition movement if his rival 's victory is officially certified as expected . the 54-year-old government candidate who has vowed to take his dispute of the vote to the supreme court ended a temporary leave and returned to his post as prime minister , a spokesman said .
the move that means he can be legally dismissed by outgoing president leonid kuchma .
under ukrainian law , no one can be fired while on vacation or other leave from their job . wrangling over election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert ahrens , osce ambassador to ukraine while more international observers endorsed the legitimacy of the re-run election held sunday , russia again attacked the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , voicing doubts about the pan-european security body 's " objectivity " in assessing the ukraine vote . discrepancies in the verdicts of western-led monitors and those from the ex-soviet bloc " make one wonder about the objectivity of international observer missions in various countries , " russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander yakovenko said in moscow . a ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman , markkyan lubkivsky , was quoted by interfax as saying , however that russian monitors ' assertion that the re-run vote was marred by fraud reflected " either a political agenda or a lack of professionalism " on their part .
ukrainian deputy prime minister mykola azarov said : " this election was democratic . " the election commission chairman , yaroslav davydovich , admitted that he had received " very many " complaints about the vote , and added that " some warrant investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2004 the new billion euro business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution and profits - the trade in emissions will be worth billions on jan .
1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .
if current predictions are realized , several billions of euros could flow over the next few years to developing and newly industrialized countries to install solar power stations , modernize gas power plants , and start reforestation programs . johannes beck -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's environmental engagement the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? business -pipe- 28.12.2004 tsunamis to further burden reinsurers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged vehicles and debris in phuket , thailand major reinsurers will face new costs after the catastrophe caused by the tsunamis in southern asia , though experts say the financial impact is likely to less than that of other disasters this year . the extent of the damage following sunday 's deadly waves is still impossible to predict .
the affected region , which includes shores in indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand and even africa , is simply too large , too little is known about the situation , and the information coming out of the region is too diffuse .
experts say it will take several days before there is reliable information about the number of victims and the scope of the damage . bildunterschrift : it 's possible , however , that the cost for reinsurers will be less than that incurred by the hurricanes earlier this year that wreaked havoc in the caribbean , florida , and parts of asia . " my guess is that the overall damage from the underwater earthquake will turn out to be less than the damage caused by the hurricanes in florida and the caribbean , " said konrad becker , analyst with merck finck . " the earthquake unfortunately hit the poorest of the poor , which is why the property insurance values will be lower , " another analyst said on condition of anonymity . lower property damage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh monday , dec .
27 , 2004 in comparison with the hurricanes that wiped out entire districts in florida and caused considerable damage in miami , the effects of the tsunamis was limited to the coastal areas of the affected countries .
no large cities , industrial parks or factories with higher insurance values were devastated . insurance firms are so far holding back with their prognoses of the extent of tsunami-related damage claims . " it 's still too early for us to assess the effects this could have for swiss re , " said simone lauper , press spokesperson for swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer .
" we still do n't have damage reports from the affected countries , because the information on the ground is still unclear . " a risk research expert at top reinsurer munich re told dw-tv that the disaster has caused economic damage in excess of € 10 billion .
gerhard berz , head of geo risk research at the munich-based firm , said the estimate was based on a " gut feeling , " but added that the estimate does not reflect the cost to the insurance industry . experts predict that costs for munich re and swiss re will be comparable .
on monday , shares in both companies ended down more than 1.6 percent . but shares in germany 's hannover re recouped most of their losses after the company said it would maintain its earnings forecast for this year , despite the damage caused by the tsunamis .

the affected region , which includes shores in indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand and even africa , is simply too large , too little is known about the situation , and the information coming out of the region is too diffuse .
experts say it will take several days before there is reliable information about the number of victims and the scope of the damage . bildunterschrift : it 's possible , however , that the cost for reinsurers will be less than that incurred by the hurricanes earlier this year that wreaked havoc in the caribbean , florida , and parts of asia . " my guess is that the overall damage from the underwater earthquake will turn out to be less than the damage caused by the hurricanes in florida and the caribbean , " said konrad becker , analyst with merck finck . " the earthquake unfortunately hit the poorest of the poor , which is why the property insurance values will be lower , " another analyst said on condition of anonymity . lower property damage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh monday , dec .
27 , 2004 in comparison with the hurricanes that wiped out entire districts in florida and caused considerable damage in miami , the effects of the tsunamis was limited to the coastal areas of the affected countries .
no large cities , industrial parks or factories with higher insurance values were devastated . insurance firms are so far holding back with their prognoses of the extent of tsunami-related damage claims . " it 's still too early for us to assess the effects this could have for swiss re , " said simone lauper , press spokesperson for swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer .
" we still do n't have damage reports from the affected countries , because the information on the ground is still unclear . " a risk research expert at top reinsurer munich re told dw-tv that the disaster has caused economic damage in excess of € 10 billion .
gerhard berz , head of geo risk research at the munich-based firm , said the estimate was based on a " gut feeling , " but added that the estimate does not reflect the cost to the insurance industry . experts predict that costs for munich re and swiss re will be comparable .
on monday , shares in both companies ended down more than 1.6 percent . but shares in germany 's hannover re recouped most of their losses after the company said it would maintain its earnings forecast for this year , despite the damage caused by the tsunamis .
hannover re 's shares fell 0.1 percent .
a company spokesperson said tsunami-related damage claims were expected to be in the low-double-digit millions of euros , well below claims of about € 300 million -lrb- $ 400 million -rrb- from the four major hurricanes that hit the united states . according to research from swiss re , 2004 was already the most expensive year to date for the reinsurance sector , even before the tsunamis hit .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .

others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes german models come of age a germany without children ? germany -pipe- 28.12.2004 germany 's graying gangsters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of seniors behind bars is rising criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .
many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

" we still do n't have damage reports from the affected countries , because the information on the ground is still unclear . " a risk research expert at top reinsurer munich re told dw-tv that the disaster has caused economic damage in excess of € 10 billion .
gerhard berz , head of geo risk research at the munich-based firm , said the estimate was based on a " gut feeling , " but added that the estimate does not reflect the cost to the insurance industry . experts predict that costs for munich re and swiss re will be comparable .

hannover re 's shares fell 0.1 percent .
a company spokesperson said tsunami-related damage claims were expected to be in the low-double-digit millions of euros , well below claims of about € 300 million -lrb- $ 400 million -rrb- from the four major hurricanes that hit the united states . according to research from swiss re , 2004 was already the most expensive year to date for the reinsurance sector , even before the tsunamis hit .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 28.12.2004 yushchenko reaches out to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for the wronged viktor the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . ukraine 's top government officials on tuesday sided with western observers ' positive assessment of sunday 's presidential election , dismissing the judgment of russia-led monitors who said sunday 's re-run election was riddled with fraud just like the previous , now-discredited nov .
21 contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , 50 , who won the election according to official resultsafter leading the country 's " orange revolution , " said he would now focus on restoring relations with moscow in interviews with several russian dailies . " we can and we must turn a page on this if we are friends and prepared to look each other in the eye , " he said in an interview with leading russian daily izvestia . yushchenko said he really did n't like the fact that " russia campaigned actively in favor of " his rival , prime minister viktor yanukovych .
but , he acknowledged that ukraine and russia were closely bound , even if he planned to build closer ties with western europe . " kiev has to say openly that russia is our close neighbor , our strategic partner , and we need to integrate with it , .
but , the western market interests us and it does n't contradict our relations with moscow , " he told russian government daily rossiskaya gazeta . yanukovych questions rival 's victory yushchenko 's claim to victory in the election was bolstered tuesday as the central election commission released results based on reporting from all the country 's precincts showing that he took 51.99 percent of the vote compared to 44.19 percent for yanukovych . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that victory however can not be formally certified until legal challenges to it have been examined and the election commission issues a definitive declaration of his win .
yanukovych , who announced monday that he planned to contest the outcome of the weekend vote , continued to blame outsiders , particularly the united states , for his loss . " the american influence in the ukrainian elections was systematic and planned " and favored yushchenko , yanukovych said in a separate interview with izvestia .
" i consider that to be interference in ukraine 's internal affairs . " at the same time he also reiterated his plan to lead an opposition movement if his rival 's victory is officially certified as expected . the 54-year-old government candidate who has vowed to take his dispute of the vote to the supreme court ended a temporary leave and returned to his post as prime minister , a spokesman said .
the move that means he can be legally dismissed by outgoing president leonid kuchma .
under ukrainian law , no one can be fired while on vacation or other leave from their job . wrangling over election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert ahrens , osce ambassador to ukraine while more international observers endorsed the legitimacy of the re-run election held sunday , russia again attacked the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , voicing doubts about the pan-european security body 's " objectivity " in assessing the ukraine vote . discrepancies in the verdicts of western-led monitors and those from the ex-soviet bloc " make one wonder about the objectivity of international observer missions in various countries , " russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander yakovenko said in moscow . a ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman , markkyan lubkivsky , was quoted by interfax as saying , however that russian monitors ' assertion that the re-run vote was marred by fraud reflected " either a political agenda or a lack of professionalism " on their part .
ukrainian deputy prime minister mykola azarov said : " this election was democratic . " the election commission chairman , yaroslav davydovich , admitted that he had received " very many " complaints about the vote , and added that " some warrant investigation . " a wake-up call for russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko celebrate a top advisor to russian president vladimir putin meanwhile praised the ukraine election and said it should be a wake-up call for russia . " ukraine is our most important partner in showing us that we can get rid of our complex about empire , " andrei illarionov told reporters in moscow .

dw-world readers weighed in on the pros and cons of teaching kids at home . the following comments reflect a cross-section of the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say on this or another issue , please click on our feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be automatically published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . home schooling is big here in the usa , the students and parents that i 've met seemed to be a lot more dedicated than those in public schools .
if it 's done properly then i believe it 's a viable option to public or private schools . - frank shipp , usa early childhood education is not merely the compulsory attendance at an educational facility in predetermined time intervals .
clearly , the process involves integrated peer , parental , and pedagogical influences .
for my own experience in the nascent stages of my education -lrb- in 1970 rural indiana -rrb- , kindergarten was most obviously devoted to socialization ; however , the parallel goal of elementary instruction was also realized .
from that period and my subsequent journey through various " public school " systems across the country , i was always prepared and apparently competent enough to graduate and enter university easily .
what must be stressed is that my parents and teachers made the most critical impact to my success .
my own children have the attention of both my wife and me regarding their daily educational progress in the public school system .
i was initially skeptical of contemporary educators , but so far they have earned my confidence .
although my kids are still young and the curriculum has changed , we will remain involved , at least minimally , to fill in the " gaps " that ever-changing didactics seem to cause .
like me at my kids ' ages , they are intellectually thriving and i remain optimistic about their educational future - for now . - frederick w. luthardt homeschooling is a viable and appropriate alternative to public and private school .
uniquely , home education provides a custom education , suited to the child 's learning style , needs , and interest .
it is far different than the pre-set one-size programs necessitated by the industrial model of education , and should not be regulated to force it to conform to standardized institutional format . - shay seaborne , virginia home education association homeschooling is an acceptable way to teach children .
here in the united states , the laws regarding the homeschooling of children vary , but it is legal .
my child has a severe speech delay .
if he were in school , they would automatically place him in a special education class .
he has been tested , and he is above average intelligence , so placing him in the public school system would only hurt his self-esteem .
there are also many parents here in the us that are religious .
and those parents want to homeschool their children , along with teaching them religious values .

berlin tuesday pledged € 2 million in financial help on top of technical and engineering experts already on the ground . germany has sent a second team of experts from its federal disaster relief organization , technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- , to sri lanka , and aid workers are en route to thailand as well at the start of an effort to clean up devastation tsunamis wreaked on the indian ocean nations .
the german interior ministry said 12 experts had been sent to sri lanka to help restore water supplies , following the arrival of three german thw staff workers in the capital city colombo on monday .
they will travel with mobile water treatment and testing equipment .
german workers in phuket in addition , the thai government requested thw help in its effort to locate bodies still buried under rubble .
some 15 aid workers are making their way to the island of phuket to aid in the search .
the death toll from the tidal waves , which were set off by an undersea earthquake and rapidly demolished coastlines of seven nations , is up to 55,000 and counting .
many thousands more are unaccounted for .
relief agencies estimate that more than two million people were left homeless .
bildunterschrift : fear of new disaster meanwhile , international aid organizations feared that decomposing bodies and contaminated water supplies could bring on a wave of deadly diseases , unleashing a second wave of tragedy on a region struggling to cope with the first .
compounding the problem is the huge number of people left homeless .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.12.2004 preparing to help abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing about lasting improvements is the goal while relief workers rushing to asia to help deal with the aftermath of the tsunamis will have little time to interact with locals , aid workers who spend more time abroad require special intercultural skills . niger , laos , belize - they 're not classic tourist destinations , though they do attract those in search of adventure .
and development workers , who 've prepared to work in places where nothing is like it is at home . " you need a great deal of courage to go and live in a developing country , " said rosemarie füglein of the center for international migration -lrb- cim -rrb- , a human resources provider with a development policy mission in frankfurt .
but it seems that many people have the required amount of courage .
for cim alone , around 700 professionals are working on assignments in more than 80 countries . development cooperation is a field that has changed greatly over the last few years .
today , it 's not just nurses and technicians who are sought after , but also political scientists and lawyers .
projects go beyond the building of wells to the shaping of social structures .
the long-term goal is to make lasting improvements to the quality of life in developing countries . more than just technical expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq in hamburg for this , people are needed who can bring more than just specialized knowledge to the job .
" know-how plus " is what 's needed , explained füglein , meaning that in addition to technical expertise , applicants should also have managerial and leadership experience , prior experience of working abroad , and the necessary social and intercultural competencies . intercultural competency is something like the magic formula of development cooperation .
development workers have to be open to the idiosyncrasies of the culture they 're working in .
development agencies for the most part work together with local partners , government ministries and non-governmental organizations .
someone who 's only prepared to live and work according to german norms will quickly find themselves running up against barriers . preparation is key to keep cross-cultural misunderstandings to a minimum , development workers receive special training before they leave home .
while still in their german surroundings , they 're taught how to negotiate in asia , or what to do in a dangerous situation in colombia .
the future development workers are taught to change their perspective , to see their own behavior from the perspective of the culture they 'll be working in .
the courses are taught by two trainers - one from germany , and one from the country in which the workers are going to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan baby is looked after by a french nurse from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- during a free medical clinic about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- north of kabul , afghanistan " the ability to reflect on oneself is very important , " said holger vagt of the german agency for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- .
important too , is the ability to think clearly and act in difficult situations .
stressful situations are frequent occurrences in developing nations . in many third world countries , violence is part of everyday life .
infrastructure is often lacking , and there 's not much in the way of cultural offerings .

while still in their german surroundings , they 're taught how to negotiate in asia , or what to do in a dangerous situation in colombia .

berlin tuesday pledged € 2 million in financial help on top of technical and engineering experts already on the ground . germany has sent a second team of experts from its federal disaster relief organization , technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- , to sri lanka , and aid workers are en route to thailand as well at the start of an effort to clean up devastation tsunamis wreaked on the indian ocean nations .
the german interior ministry said 12 experts had been sent to sri lanka to help restore water supplies , following the arrival of three german thw staff workers in the capital city colombo on monday .
they will travel with mobile water treatment and testing equipment .
german workers in phuket in addition , the thai government requested thw help in its effort to locate bodies still buried under rubble .
some 15 aid workers are making their way to the island of phuket to aid in the search .
the death toll from the tidal waves , which were set off by an undersea earthquake and rapidly demolished coastlines of seven nations , is up to 55,000 and counting .
many thousands more are unaccounted for .
relief agencies estimate that more than two million people were left homeless .
bildunterschrift : fear of new disaster meanwhile , international aid organizations feared that decomposing bodies and contaminated water supplies could bring on a wave of deadly diseases , unleashing a second wave of tragedy on a region struggling to cope with the first .
compounding the problem is the huge number of people left homeless .
" the biggest health challenges we are facing are the spread of waterborne diseases , " said hakan sandbladh , a health official with the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies .
massive relief operation " the people should be buried and the animals should be destroyed and disposed of before they infect the drinking water , " said jan egeland , the un 's disaster relief coordinator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean workers from korea red cross carry 8,000 blankets for tsunami victims egeland told a press conference at its headquarters in new york that relief operations would be the biggest ever as the destruction was not confined to one country or region .
" the cost of the devastation will be in the billions of dollars , " he said .
" it would probably be many billions of dollars . "
in an interview with dw-tv , gerhard berz , the director of geo risk research at the world 's largest reinsurer , munich re , also said he expected economic damages to " clearly amount to double-digit billion figures . " germany increases aid meanwhile , offers of aid are pouring in from around the world .
the german government has pledged € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- of emergency aid to the countries affected and promised long-term reconstruction assistance , german foreign minister joschka fischer announced on tuesday , adding that more planes would leave for south asia to provide medical treatment and technical assistance . " following a meeting of the government ’ s crisis team on tuesday morning , we ’ ve planned to send a medevac flying hospital aircraft to phuket to provide urgent medical treatment to injured tourists , " he said .
" two other charter planes are also going to phuket with additional medical equipment and embassy personnel plus doctors and engineers on board .
these planes are then scheduled to bring back home german tourists who can not leave the crisis region with the help of private tour operators .
our team of technical and engineering experts already on the ground will be sent to khao lak in thailand to assist rescue operations there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- also urged germans to donate more money to the victims . " it stands to reason that we ’ ll show the greatest possible solidarity with the nations hit by the tsunami , " he said .
" in this context , i ’ d like to appeal to germans to donate generously to charity funds for the affected regions rather than spending millions of euros on pyrotechnical gadgets during the forthcoming new year ’ s celebrations . " fischer said it was still unclear how many germans were among the victims of the disaster , but he estimated that it could be several hundred . click on the next page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis to further burden reinsurers major reinsurers will face new costs after the catastrophe caused by the tsunamis in southern asia , though experts say the financial impact is likely to less than that of other disasters this year -lrb- dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.12.2004 preparing to help abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing about lasting improvements is the goal while relief workers rushing to asia to help deal with the aftermath of the tsunamis will have little time to interact with locals , aid workers who spend more time abroad require special intercultural skills . niger , laos , belize - they 're not classic tourist destinations , though they do attract those in search of adventure .
and development workers , who 've prepared to work in places where nothing is like it is at home . " you need a great deal of courage to go and live in a developing country , " said rosemarie füglein of the center for international migration -lrb- cim -rrb- , a human resources provider with a development policy mission in frankfurt .
but it seems that many people have the required amount of courage .
for cim alone , around 700 professionals are working on assignments in more than 80 countries . development cooperation is a field that has changed greatly over the last few years .
today , it 's not just nurses and technicians who are sought after , but also political scientists and lawyers .
projects go beyond the building of wells to the shaping of social structures .
the long-term goal is to make lasting improvements to the quality of life in developing countries . more than just technical expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers of german relief organization " asb " load humanitarian aid for iraq in hamburg for this , people are needed who can bring more than just specialized knowledge to the job .
" know-how plus " is what 's needed , explained füglein , meaning that in addition to technical expertise , applicants should also have managerial and leadership experience , prior experience of working abroad , and the necessary social and intercultural competencies . intercultural competency is something like the magic formula of development cooperation .
development workers have to be open to the idiosyncrasies of the culture they 're working in .
development agencies for the most part work together with local partners , government ministries and non-governmental organizations .
someone who 's only prepared to live and work according to german norms will quickly find themselves running up against barriers . preparation is key to keep cross-cultural misunderstandings to a minimum , development workers receive special training before they leave home .
while still in their german surroundings , they 're taught how to negotiate in asia , or what to do in a dangerous situation in colombia .
the future development workers are taught to change their perspective , to see their own behavior from the perspective of the culture they 'll be working in .
the courses are taught by two trainers - one from germany , and one from the country in which the workers are going to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan baby is looked after by a french nurse from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- during a free medical clinic about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- north of kabul , afghanistan " the ability to reflect on oneself is very important , " said holger vagt of the german agency for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- .
important too , is the ability to think clearly and act in difficult situations .
stressful situations are frequent occurrences in developing nations . in many third world countries , violence is part of everyday life .
infrastructure is often lacking , and there 's not much in the way of cultural offerings .
development workers have to adjust to such conditions .
that 's why it 's important to send " stable personalities " abroad , said vagt . " people who have difficulties handling their lives in germany are ill-suited for work in the field of development cooperation , " he said . christiane wolters -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training to deal with crisis german rescue specialists reacted swiftly to iran ’ s earthquake and offered expertise on the ground , thanks in part to germany ’ s “ academy for crisis management ” that trains workers to deal with the worst .

berlin tuesday pledged € 2 million in financial help on top of technical and engineering experts already on the ground . germany has sent a second team of experts from its federal disaster relief organization , technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- , to sri lanka , and aid workers are en route to thailand as well at the start of an effort to clean up devastation tsunamis wreaked on the indian ocean nations .
the german interior ministry said 12 experts had been sent to sri lanka to help restore water supplies , following the arrival of three german thw staff workers in the capital city colombo on monday .
they will travel with mobile water treatment and testing equipment .
german workers in phuket in addition , the thai government requested thw help in its effort to locate bodies still buried under rubble .
some 15 aid workers are making their way to the island of phuket to aid in the search .
the death toll from the tidal waves , which were set off by an undersea earthquake and rapidly demolished coastlines of seven nations , is up to 55,000 and counting .
many thousands more are unaccounted for .
relief agencies estimate that more than two million people were left homeless .
bildunterschrift : fear of new disaster meanwhile , international aid organizations feared that decomposing bodies and contaminated water supplies could bring on a wave of deadly diseases , unleashing a second wave of tragedy on a region struggling to cope with the first .
compounding the problem is the huge number of people left homeless .
" the biggest health challenges we are facing are the spread of waterborne diseases , " said hakan sandbladh , a health official with the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies .
massive relief operation " the people should be buried and the animals should be destroyed and disposed of before they infect the drinking water , " said jan egeland , the un 's disaster relief coordinator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean workers from korea red cross carry 8,000 blankets for tsunami victims egeland told a press conference at its headquarters in new york that relief operations would be the biggest ever as the destruction was not confined to one country or region .
" the cost of the devastation will be in the billions of dollars , " he said .
" it would probably be many billions of dollars . "
in an interview with dw-tv , gerhard berz , the director of geo risk research at the world 's largest reinsurer , munich re , also said he expected economic damages to " clearly amount to double-digit billion figures . " germany increases aid meanwhile , offers of aid are pouring in from around the world .
the german government has pledged € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- of emergency aid to the countries affected and promised long-term reconstruction assistance , german foreign minister joschka fischer announced on tuesday , adding that more planes would leave for south asia to provide medical treatment and technical assistance . " following a meeting of the government ’ s crisis team on tuesday morning , we ’ ve planned to send a medevac flying hospital aircraft to phuket to provide urgent medical treatment to injured tourists , " he said .
" two other charter planes are also going to phuket with additional medical equipment and embassy personnel plus doctors and engineers on board .
these planes are then scheduled to bring back home german tourists who can not leave the crisis region with the help of private tour operators .
our team of technical and engineering experts already on the ground will be sent to khao lak in thailand to assist rescue operations there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- also urged germans to donate more money to the victims . " it stands to reason that we ’ ll show the greatest possible solidarity with the nations hit by the tsunami , " he said .
" in this context , i ’ d like to appeal to germans to donate generously to charity funds for the affected regions rather than spending millions of euros on pyrotechnical gadgets during the forthcoming new year ’ s celebrations . " fischer said it was still unclear how many germans were among the victims of the disaster , but he estimated that it could be several hundred . click on the next page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis to further burden reinsurers major reinsurers will face new costs after the catastrophe caused by the tsunamis in southern asia , though experts say the financial impact is likely to less than that of other disasters this year -lrb- dec .

the german interior ministry said 12 experts had been sent to sri lanka to help restore water supplies , following the arrival of three german thw staff workers in the capital city colombo on monday .
they will travel with mobile water treatment and testing equipment .
german workers in phuket in addition , the thai government requested thw help in its effort to locate bodies still buried under rubble .
some 15 aid workers are making their way to the island of phuket to aid in the search .
the death toll from the tidal waves , which were set off by an undersea earthquake and rapidly demolished coastlines of seven nations , is up to 55,000 and counting .
many thousands more are unaccounted for .
relief agencies estimate that more than two million people were left homeless .
bildunterschrift : fear of new disaster meanwhile , international aid organizations feared that decomposing bodies and contaminated water supplies could bring on a wave of deadly diseases , unleashing a second wave of tragedy on a region struggling to cope with the first .
compounding the problem is the huge number of people left homeless .
" the biggest health challenges we are facing are the spread of waterborne diseases , " said hakan sandbladh , a health official with the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies .
massive relief operation " the people should be buried and the animals should be destroyed and disposed of before they infect the drinking water , " said jan egeland , the un 's disaster relief coordinator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean workers from korea red cross carry 8,000 blankets for tsunami victims egeland told a press conference at its headquarters in new york that relief operations would be the biggest ever as the destruction was not confined to one country or region .

" it would probably be many billions of dollars . "

" germany increases aid meanwhile , offers of aid are pouring in from around the world .

" following a meeting of the government ’ s crisis team on tuesday morning , we ’ ve planned to send a medevac flying hospital aircraft to phuket to provide urgent medical treatment to injured tourists , " he said .
" two other charter planes are also going to phuket with additional medical equipment and embassy personnel plus doctors and engineers on board .
these planes are then scheduled to bring back home german tourists who can not leave the crisis region with the help of private tour operators .
our team of technical and engineering experts already on the ground will be sent to khao lak in thailand to assist rescue operations there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- also urged germans to donate more money to the victims . " it stands to reason that we ’ ll show the greatest possible solidarity with the nations hit by the tsunami , " he said .
" in this context , i ’ d like to appeal to germans to donate generously to charity funds for the affected regions rather than spending millions of euros on pyrotechnical gadgets during the forthcoming new year ’ s celebrations . " fischer said it was still unclear how many germans were among the victims of the disaster , but he estimated that it could be several hundred . click on the next page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunamis to further burden reinsurers major reinsurers will face new costs after the catastrophe caused by the tsunamis in southern asia , though experts say the financial impact is likely to less than that of other disasters this year -lrb- dec .

it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .

only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .

" it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes german models come of age a germany without children ? germany -pipe- 28.12.2004 germany 's graying gangsters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of seniors behind bars is rising criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .
many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .

nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .
if current predictions are realized , several billions of euros could flow over the next few years to developing and newly industrialized countries to install solar power stations , modernize gas power plants , and start reforestation programs . johannes beck -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's environmental engagement the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2004 the new billion euro business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution and profits - the trade in emissions will be worth billions on jan .
1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .
if current predictions are realized , several billions of euros could flow over the next few years to developing and newly industrialized countries to install solar power stations , modernize gas power plants , and start reforestation programs . johannes beck -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's environmental engagement the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .

emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .

under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .

the affected region , which includes shores in indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand and even africa , is simply too large , too little is known about the situation , and the information coming out of the region is too diffuse .
experts say it will take several days before there is reliable information about the number of victims and the scope of the damage . bildunterschrift : it 's possible , however , that the cost for reinsurers will be less than that incurred by the hurricanes earlier this year that wreaked havoc in the caribbean , florida , and parts of asia . " my guess is that the overall damage from the underwater earthquake will turn out to be less than the damage caused by the hurricanes in florida and the caribbean , " said konrad becker , analyst with merck finck . " the earthquake unfortunately hit the poorest of the poor , which is why the property insurance values will be lower , " another analyst said on condition of anonymity . lower property damage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh monday , dec .
27 , 2004 in comparison with the hurricanes that wiped out entire districts in florida and caused considerable damage in miami , the effects of the tsunamis was limited to the coastal areas of the affected countries .
no large cities , industrial parks or factories with higher insurance values were devastated . insurance firms are so far holding back with their prognoses of the extent of tsunami-related damage claims . " it 's still too early for us to assess the effects this could have for swiss re , " said simone lauper , press spokesperson for swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer .
" we still do n't have damage reports from the affected countries , because the information on the ground is still unclear . " a risk research expert at top reinsurer munich re told dw-tv that the disaster has caused economic damage in excess of € 10 billion .
gerhard berz , head of geo risk research at the munich-based firm , said the estimate was based on a " gut feeling , " but added that the estimate does not reflect the cost to the insurance industry . experts predict that costs for munich re and swiss re will be comparable .
on monday , shares in both companies ended down more than 1.6 percent . but shares in germany 's hannover re recouped most of their losses after the company said it would maintain its earnings forecast for this year , despite the damage caused by the tsunamis .
hannover re 's shares fell 0.1 percent .
a company spokesperson said tsunami-related damage claims were expected to be in the low-double-digit millions of euros , well below claims of about € 300 million -lrb- $ 400 million -rrb- from the four major hurricanes that hit the united states . according to research from swiss re , 2004 was already the most expensive year to date for the reinsurance sector , even before the tsunamis hit .
a string of disasters both natural and man-made have prompted claims to property insurers of about $ 42 billion , swiss re estimated . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .
if current predictions are realized , several billions of euros could flow over the next few years to developing and newly industrialized countries to install solar power stations , modernize gas power plants , and start reforestation programs . johannes beck -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's environmental engagement the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .

one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

berlin tuesday pledged € 2 million in financial help on top of technical and engineering experts already on the ground . germany has sent a second team of experts from its federal disaster relief organization , technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- , to sri lanka , and aid workers are en route to thailand as well at the start of an effort to clean up devastation tsunamis wreaked on the indian ocean nations .
the german interior ministry said 12 experts had been sent to sri lanka to help restore water supplies , following the arrival of three german thw staff workers in the capital city colombo on monday .
they will travel with mobile water treatment and testing equipment .
german workers in phuket in addition , the thai government requested thw help in its effort to locate bodies still buried under rubble .
some 15 aid workers are making their way to the island of phuket to aid in the search .
the death toll from the tidal waves , which were set off by an undersea earthquake and rapidly demolished coastlines of seven nations , is up to 55,000 and counting .
many thousands more are unaccounted for .
relief agencies estimate that more than two million people were left homeless .
bildunterschrift : fear of new disaster meanwhile , international aid organizations feared that decomposing bodies and contaminated water supplies could bring on a wave of deadly diseases , unleashing a second wave of tragedy on a region struggling to cope with the first .
compounding the problem is the huge number of people left homeless .
" the biggest health challenges we are facing are the spread of waterborne diseases , " said hakan sandbladh , a health official with the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies .
massive relief operation " the people should be buried and the animals should be destroyed and disposed of before they infect the drinking water , " said jan egeland , the un 's disaster relief coordinator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean workers from korea red cross carry 8,000 blankets for tsunami victims egeland told a press conference at its headquarters in new york that relief operations would be the biggest ever as the destruction was not confined to one country or region .
" the cost of the devastation will be in the billions of dollars , " he said .
" it would probably be many billions of dollars . "
in an interview with dw-tv , gerhard berz , the director of geo risk research at the world 's largest reinsurer , munich re , also said he expected economic damages to " clearly amount to double-digit billion figures . " germany increases aid meanwhile , offers of aid are pouring in from around the world .
the german government has pledged € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- of emergency aid to the countries affected and promised long-term reconstruction assistance , german foreign minister joschka fischer announced on tuesday , adding that more planes would leave for south asia to provide medical treatment and technical assistance . " following a meeting of the government ’ s crisis team on tuesday morning , we ’ ve planned to send a medevac flying hospital aircraft to phuket to provide urgent medical treatment to injured tourists , " he said .
" two other charter planes are also going to phuket with additional medical equipment and embassy personnel plus doctors and engineers on board .
these planes are then scheduled to bring back home german tourists who can not leave the crisis region with the help of private tour operators .

" we can and we must turn a page on this if we are friends and prepared to look each other in the eye , " he said in an interview with leading russian daily izvestia . yushchenko said he really did n't like the fact that " russia campaigned actively in favor of " his rival , prime minister viktor yanukovych .
but , he acknowledged that ukraine and russia were closely bound , even if he planned to build closer ties with western europe . " kiev has to say openly that russia is our close neighbor , our strategic partner , and we need to integrate with it , .
but , the western market interests us and it does n't contradict our relations with moscow , " he told russian government daily rossiskaya gazeta . yanukovych questions rival 's victory yushchenko 's claim to victory in the election was bolstered tuesday as the central election commission released results based on reporting from all the country 's precincts showing that he took 51.99 percent of the vote compared to 44.19 percent for yanukovych . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that victory however can not be formally certified until legal challenges to it have been examined and the election commission issues a definitive declaration of his win .
yanukovych , who announced monday that he planned to contest the outcome of the weekend vote , continued to blame outsiders , particularly the united states , for his loss . " the american influence in the ukrainian elections was systematic and planned " and favored yushchenko , yanukovych said in a separate interview with izvestia .
" i consider that to be interference in ukraine 's internal affairs .

ukrainian deputy prime minister mykola azarov said : " this election was democratic . " the election commission chairman , yaroslav davydovich , admitted that he had received " very many " complaints about the vote , and added that " some warrant investigation .

the affected region , which includes shores in indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand and even africa , is simply too large , too little is known about the situation , and the information coming out of the region is too diffuse .
experts say it will take several days before there is reliable information about the number of victims and the scope of the damage . bildunterschrift : it 's possible , however , that the cost for reinsurers will be less than that incurred by the hurricanes earlier this year that wreaked havoc in the caribbean , florida , and parts of asia . " my guess is that the overall damage from the underwater earthquake will turn out to be less than the damage caused by the hurricanes in florida and the caribbean , " said konrad becker , analyst with merck finck . " the earthquake unfortunately hit the poorest of the poor , which is why the property insurance values will be lower , " another analyst said on condition of anonymity . lower property damage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh monday , dec .
27 , 2004 in comparison with the hurricanes that wiped out entire districts in florida and caused considerable damage in miami , the effects of the tsunamis was limited to the coastal areas of the affected countries .
no large cities , industrial parks or factories with higher insurance values were devastated . insurance firms are so far holding back with their prognoses of the extent of tsunami-related damage claims .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .
on the other hand , if he had to do time again , a place with an older clientele might not be all that bad . “ not that i ’ m ready to check in or anything , ” he said .
“ but i wouldn ’ t mind having it a little quieter in the klink next time , getting to shuffle around in my slippers . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgian criminals try to make amends a new concept in criminal justice - bringing together victims and their offenders - is taking hold in europe .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds . " it does n't matter where we save the co2 emissions , " said basf 's emissions trading director , dirk drechsel .
" if you save a ton in china , it 's worth just as much as a ton saved in europe .
the basic principle of emissions trading is to seek out the most cost-effective methods of reduction , and to do that on a global basis .
it 's not taking away from the responsibility to reduce emissions in europe , rather , it 's a way of integrating the whole world in emissions trading . " projects in developing countries first have to be certified by independent agencies , and registered with the united nations framework convention on climate change in bonn .
if current predictions are realized , several billions of euros could flow over the next few years to developing and newly industrialized countries to install solar power stations , modernize gas power plants , and start reforestation programs . johannes beck -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's environmental engagement the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . home schooling is big here in the usa , the students and parents that i 've met seemed to be a lot more dedicated than those in public schools .
if it 's done properly then i believe it 's a viable option to public or private schools . - frank shipp , usa early childhood education is not merely the compulsory attendance at an educational facility in predetermined time intervals .
clearly , the process involves integrated peer , parental , and pedagogical influences .
for my own experience in the nascent stages of my education -lrb- in 1970 rural indiana -rrb- , kindergarten was most obviously devoted to socialization ; however , the parallel goal of elementary instruction was also realized .
from that period and my subsequent journey through various " public school " systems across the country , i was always prepared and apparently competent enough to graduate and enter university easily .
what must be stressed is that my parents and teachers made the most critical impact to my success .
my own children have the attention of both my wife and me regarding their daily educational progress in the public school system .
i was initially skeptical of contemporary educators , but so far they have earned my confidence .
although my kids are still young and the curriculum has changed , we will remain involved , at least minimally , to fill in the " gaps " that ever-changing didactics seem to cause .
like me at my kids ' ages , they are intellectually thriving and i remain optimistic about their educational future - for now . - frederick w. luthardt homeschooling is a viable and appropriate alternative to public and private school .
uniquely , home education provides a custom education , suited to the child 's learning style , needs , and interest .
it is far different than the pre-set one-size programs necessitated by the industrial model of education , and should not be regulated to force it to conform to standardized institutional format . - shay seaborne , virginia home education association homeschooling is an acceptable way to teach children .
here in the united states , the laws regarding the homeschooling of children vary , but it is legal .
my child has a severe speech delay .
if he were in school , they would automatically place him in a special education class .
he has been tested , and he is above average intelligence , so placing him in the public school system would only hurt his self-esteem .
there are also many parents here in the us that are religious .
and those parents want to homeschool their children , along with teaching them religious values .
people argue that children wo n't become ' socialized ' if they 're homeschooled - but how can this be true ?
are n't i as a parent a human also ?
he socializes not only with me , but with his grandparents and other family members , along with people we meet in stores , the post office , etc .
and as far as learning goes , my child benefits from the one-on-one contact he receives from me and my parents .
this attention is something he would never get from teachers in a classroom setting .
and to be perfectly honest , i have met many people who graduated from public school who could barely read or write , whereas i can rest assured knowing that my son will be able to .
i believe that parents have the right to teach their children at home - after all , parents have been doing that for centuries . - dawn c. stricklin , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living room lessons not easy in germany opting to teach your kids at home instead of sending them to school is not an easy decision .
in germany , homeschooling is even illegal .
but , around 200 parents here do it anyway .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 28.12.2004 yushchenko reaches out to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for the wronged viktor the winner of ukraine 's bitterly-fought presidential poll , yushchenko , moved tuesday to repair damage to relations with russia while his opponent , yanukovych , persisted in blaming the west for his defeat . ukraine 's top government officials on tuesday sided with western observers ' positive assessment of sunday 's presidential election , dismissing the judgment of russia-led monitors who said sunday 's re-run election was riddled with fraud just like the previous , now-discredited nov .
21 contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , 50 , who won the election according to official resultsafter leading the country 's " orange revolution , " said he would now focus on restoring relations with moscow in interviews with several russian dailies . " we can and we must turn a page on this if we are friends and prepared to look each other in the eye , " he said in an interview with leading russian daily izvestia . yushchenko said he really did n't like the fact that " russia campaigned actively in favor of " his rival , prime minister viktor yanukovych .
but , he acknowledged that ukraine and russia were closely bound , even if he planned to build closer ties with western europe . " kiev has to say openly that russia is our close neighbor , our strategic partner , and we need to integrate with it , .
but , the western market interests us and it does n't contradict our relations with moscow , " he told russian government daily rossiskaya gazeta . yanukovych questions rival 's victory yushchenko 's claim to victory in the election was bolstered tuesday as the central election commission released results based on reporting from all the country 's precincts showing that he took 51.99 percent of the vote compared to 44.19 percent for yanukovych . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that victory however can not be formally certified until legal challenges to it have been examined and the election commission issues a definitive declaration of his win .
yanukovych , who announced monday that he planned to contest the outcome of the weekend vote , continued to blame outsiders , particularly the united states , for his loss . " the american influence in the ukrainian elections was systematic and planned " and favored yushchenko , yanukovych said in a separate interview with izvestia .
" i consider that to be interference in ukraine 's internal affairs . " at the same time he also reiterated his plan to lead an opposition movement if his rival 's victory is officially certified as expected . the 54-year-old government candidate who has vowed to take his dispute of the vote to the supreme court ended a temporary leave and returned to his post as prime minister , a spokesman said .
the move that means he can be legally dismissed by outgoing president leonid kuchma .
under ukrainian law , no one can be fired while on vacation or other leave from their job . wrangling over election outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert ahrens , osce ambassador to ukraine while more international observers endorsed the legitimacy of the re-run election held sunday , russia again attacked the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , voicing doubts about the pan-european security body 's " objectivity " in assessing the ukraine vote . discrepancies in the verdicts of western-led monitors and those from the ex-soviet bloc " make one wonder about the objectivity of international observer missions in various countries , " russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander yakovenko said in moscow . a ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman , markkyan lubkivsky , was quoted by interfax as saying , however that russian monitors ' assertion that the re-run vote was marred by fraud reflected " either a political agenda or a lack of professionalism " on their part .
ukrainian deputy prime minister mykola azarov said : " this election was democratic . " the election commission chairman , yaroslav davydovich , admitted that he had received " very many " complaints about the vote , and added that " some warrant investigation .

deutsche post 's oldest christmas branch was set up in 1967 in the himmelsthür district of hildesheim . deutsche post said in a statement that the share of letters pouring in from abroad had more than doubled this year .

but it seems that many people have the required amount of courage .
for cim alone , around 700 professionals are working on assignments in more than 80 countries . development cooperation is a field that has changed greatly over the last few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2004 the new billion euro business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution and profits - the trade in emissions will be worth billions on jan .
1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .
" around 25 percent of the total emissions allowances in the eu are assigned in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in crisis talks with other federal ministers in march 2004 to clear up differing opinions within the ruling coalition on emissions trading .
emissions trading is n't expected to really get into full swing until the end of february , when the german registrar for emissions trading is up and running at the federal environment ministry .
only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .
nine countries , including greece , italy and poland , have not yet assigned their emissions allowances . investing in developing nations in future , it will also be possible to trade emission credits gained from climate protection projects in developing and newly industrialized countries .
in the eu , the netherlands has been leading the way with the so-called clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- .
under the scheme , dutch energy provider essent has already built up a wind park in tejona , costa rica .
the clean energy generated by the wind turbines can be credited to essent in the form of trade certificates and then sold . german firm basf is also indirectly supporting projects in developing countries , via world bank-administered funds .

1 , the eu emissions trading directive comes into force .
it 's been called the most important piece of climate change legislation to date - and it could also be the start of a new global business worth billions . under the new eu scheme , power stations , refineries and heavy industry across europe will be given limits on how much carbon dioxide they can emit .
in germany alone , around 1,700 companies will be bound by the scheme , with the aim of reducing their current 505 million tons of carbon dioxide a year to 495 million tons . participating companies need to hold sufficient carbon dioxide allowances .
those that produce too much have to pay stiff fines , or buy spare allowances - either directly from a company that has managed to reduce its emissions , or from middlemen , brokers , or trade platforms that will function like a sort of energy exchange market . lucrative market the leipzig-based company eex -lrb- european energy exchange -rrb- has already conducted research in 13 european countries to get an idea of how large the trade in emissions allowances will be in the year ahead . " on average , companies are predicting that there 'll be an eu-wide trade volume of around 150 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in 2005 .
that means that we can count on an eu-wide wholesale turnover of between € 1.4 to 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.89 - 2.03 billion -rrb- , " said eex spokesman stefan niessen . there are around half a dozen bourses in europe that will be competing for their share of this new billion euro business .
among them is the european climate exchange in amsterdam , a cooperative project involving london 's international petroleum exchange and the chicago climate exchange from the united states .
in germany , eex is in the starting blocks and hopes to become the german market leader . " we believe we 're in a good position to offer trade for all involved at very low cost .
and we 're confident that we 've already got the major participants in emissions trading on board , so we 're well prepared , " niessen said . since march 2004 , eex has been publishing prices per ton of carbon dioxide on a daily basis .
in december , the price was around € 8.50 .
however , trade is n't yet occurring via exchange markets , rather via independent traders .
despite this , eex has managed to establish itself as an index - an advantage over its european competitors . " added to this is the fact that germany is home to the largest population and the largest domestic market in emissions trading , " niessen said .

only then can emissions allowances be reassigned from one company to another .
in other eu countries , the trade will be delayed much longer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes german models come of age a germany without children ? germany -pipe- 28.12.2004 germany 's graying gangsters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of seniors behind bars is rising criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .
many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .
one state plans to open a prison designed for older offenders . one female pensioner in western germany has decided to fill the autumn of her life with something other than baking pies or watching the sunset from the warmth of her back porch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pistol granny " during a robbery in 2001 .
the woman was never caught she is out gathering some cold , hard cash by robbing banks , at least four in the last four years .
from the images captured on security cameras , " pistol granny , " as she 's been christened by tabloids , has passed her 70th birthday already . in november , police busted a fairly successful gang of bank robbers who had taken in € 400,000 -lrb- $ 541,000 -rrb- in the last five years .
the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .
some resort to petty crimes like shoplifting just for the thrill of it , seeing it almost as an adventure to spice up an otherwise colorless existence .
others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .
“ they ’ d have no communication with young people , and that ’ s not good for them . ” peter rausch , 72 , is of two minds on the prison matter , a topic he knows all too well .
he went to jail for the first time at the age of 17 and has been in and out of incarceration all his life .
he was over 60 when he finished his last sentence and still has occasional brushes with the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he ’ s still active and in good health and worries that if he were put in an institution with elderly people , some of whom were infirm , he ’ d end up looking after them or , worse , acting like them .

the three men , who demonstrated their seriousness to bank employees with pistols , sledge hammers and hand grenades , were aged 63 , 72 and 74 . “ there is an increase in the number of elderly people committing crimes and we have to face this problem , ” said jutta rosendahl of the justice ministry in the state of lower saxony .
officials there are working out plans for the country ’ s first prison designed exclusively for the over 60 set . a slammer for seniors the justice ministry wants to turn a jail in need of renovation near the town of bückeburg into a low-security institution exclusively for older criminals , whose needs and interests are different than those of younger offenders , officials believe .
graying prisoners generally aren ’ t as interested in body building or basketball as they once were , and the prison for seniors would instead have physical therapy on offer and be outfitted ramps that make life easier for wrongdoers in wheelchairs . jobs in the old-age prison would be appropriate for those retirement age or older .
gone would be the physically demanding positions in the prison laundry or metal shop .
the focus in the seniors slammer would be on assembly work felons can perform sitting down . social programs would also be different .
those over 60 have little need for high school diplomas or traineeships .
instead , resocialization programs would focus on practical needs , like basic living and cooking skills . “ it won ’ t be a wellness farm for elderly people , ” rosendahl said .
“ but it will address their special problems and give them a better chance at having a normal life after being released from prison . ” rising numbers while little data about aged lawbreakers exists , germany ’ s statistics office reports criminality among older people has risen some 28 percent since the mid 1990s .
the number of elderly people doing time behind bars is also on the increase .
while the number of 18 to 21-year-olds in german prison declined slightly between 2001 and 2003 , the number of prisoners over age 60 has risen by over 400 . criminologists and justice officials insist the jump in numbers does not mean german is experiencing a gray crime wave , but they do say that there are several developments in germany leading more grandmas and grandpas outside the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reason is simple demographics : german society in general is getting older , meaning the pool of possible criminals from the upper age group is getting larger every year . “ the more elderly people you have in a country , the more elderly criminals you ’ ll have , ” said arthur kreuzer , the director of the institute of criminology at the university of giessen . poverty as driver another reason is the changing quality of life among many seniors in germany .
poverty rates among older people have been inching up as prices rise and pension rates remain stagnant or the incremental increases fail to keep up with inflation . “ older people have to get by with less and less money and some are almost forced to resort to shoplifting just to maintain a reasonable standard of living during their retirement , ” said frank geppert , a social worker at freie hilfe berlin , an organization that helps prisoners reintegrate into society after they ’ ve been released . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts also say that as family bonds weaken in germany and state-supported programs for seniors fall victim to budget cuts , older people are becoming increasingly isolated .

others hope to get caught , happy that someone , security personnel in these cases , is paying attention to them since generally , no one else does . while gray crime includes everything from fraud and extortion to sexual abuse and murder , most are petty offenses .
according to criminologist kreuzer , shoplifting makes up 80 percent of senior cases . more isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but not everyone thinks the old-age prisons are a good idea , fearing they could lead to even more isolation .
according to berlin social worker geppert , one of the goals of german prisons is to have a mix of people and ages that represents , as closely as possible , the society on the outside .
a prison for the elderly would take prisoners one more step away from the normal world . “ it would be like an old folks home and the ones who were still mentally alert would feel shut away with a lot who might already be senile , ” he said .

the make poverty history campaign says it wants britain to make laws stopping big business from " profiting at the expense of people and the environment " .
the prime minister has declared his aim is to put development at the top of the international agenda .
but the campaign says unfair trade policies , debt and lack of aid are costing lives .
' imposed policies ' the groups supporting the campaign say britain has done little to stop unfair and undemocratic policies being imposed on poor countries . "
we want 2005 to be remembered as the year that changed the world " make poverty history " we know what the problems are but until now there has not been the political will to do something about them , " said steve tibbett from actionaid on behalf of make poverty history .
" we want 2005 to be remembered as the year that changed the world , " he added .
the campaign says it wants an end to exports being " dumped " in ways that harm poor rural communities around the world .
and it is also calling for the " unpayable debts " of the poorest countries to be cancelled in full and for at least an extra £ 50bn dollars to be given in aid each year .
' make or break ' it argues that without such steps global poverty will not become history .
earlier this month , gordon brown said next year would be " make or break " for development in poorer countries as he set out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies .
the chancellor outlined a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005 , during a speech in london .
they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations .

sir john stevens told the bbc that if forces had to " man up " the streets when people left pubs around 3am it would take officers away from other duties .
the metropolitan police commissioner , who is to stand down in january , said binge-drinking was a growing problem .
the government is due to overhaul licensing laws next year .
' deteriorating behaviour ' it is hoped permitting pubs and clubs to stay open all day will stagger closing times and avoid drinkers spilling onto the streets at the same time .
but sir john said such a move would take resources away from other areas of policing , as officers will be diverted to manning the streets in the early hours . "
you can see excessive drinking in extraordinary amounts on a friday or saturday night - that 's one of the reasons i think that assaults against the police have gone up " sir john stevens " the fact that large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean that we have to man up the streets to deliver a service to ensure these people behave . "
he also said binge-drinking was a growing problem .
" i think there has been a deterioration in how people behave on the streets , " he said .
" you can see excessive drinking in extraordinary amounts on a friday or saturday night .
that 's one of the reasons i think that assaults against the police have gone up .
the number of assaults on police officers in london had risen 40 % this year , he said .
this was also partly because they have become more " proactive " , with 30,000 more arrests this year than two years ago .
new powers the government 's licensing act 2003 - due to be introduced next year - will give local authorities , and not magistrates , the power grant licences .
not only will it allow round-the-clock drinking , but it will combine alcohol and entertainment licences into a single licence .
local authorities will also get discretion to apply flexible opening hours .
and the bill aims to combat drink-related disorder .
police will have new powers to close any licensed premises without notice for up to 24 hours if there are problems with disorder or noise nuisance .
culture secretary tessa jowell has said the bill will treat people " like grown-ups " and give the current laws a much-needed overhaul .
' terror success ' in the bbc interview , sir john also reiterated earlier comments calling for the law on protecting yourself against an intruder to be clarified .
he said there needed to be a " presumption of innocence " on anyone who injures an intruder defending their home .
but the biggest challenge - and frustration - facing police was the threat of terrorism , he added .
" the effort that has gone on since 11 september has been absolutely considerable , " he said .
" it is something that we have been very successful on . "
but , he said , their successes could not be publicised or were not always reflected in the press , so officers were not always given credit where credit was due .
he also told how he had changed his mind on the government 's plan to introduce id cards .
he said he had become convinced that being able to be certain of people 's identity was now essential .
sir john also said there had to be a balance between protecting the country and protecting human rights .
" i want to make it absolutely clear that some of the laws that have been introduced have been absolutely essential to safeguarding this country , " he said .

' deteriorating behaviour ' it is hoped permitting pubs and clubs to stay open all day will stagger closing times and avoid drinkers spilling onto the streets at the same time .
but sir john said such a move would take resources away from other areas of policing , as officers will be diverted to manning the streets in the early hours .
you can see excessive drinking in extraordinary amounts on a friday or saturday night - that 's one of the reasons i think that assaults against the police have gone up sir john stevens " the fact that large groups of people will be coming out at 3am or 4am will mean that we have to man up the streets to deliver a service to ensure these people behave . "
he also said binge-drinking was a growing problem .
" i think there has been a deterioration in how people behave on the streets , " he said .
" you can see excessive drinking in extraordinary amounts on a friday or saturday night .
that 's one of the reasons i think that assaults against the police have gone up .
the number of assaults on police officers in london had risen 40 % this year , he said .
this was also partly because they have become more " proactive " , with 30,000 more arrests this year than two years ago .
new powers the government 's licensing act 2003 - due to be introduced next year - will give local authorities , and not magistrates , the power grant licences .
not only will it allow round-the-clock drinking , but it will combine alcohol and entertainment licences into a single licence .
local authorities will also get discretion to apply flexible opening hours .
and the bill aims to combat drink-related disorder .
police will have new powers to close any licensed premises without notice for up to 24 hours if there are problems with disorder or noise nuisance .
culture secretary tessa jowell has said the bill will treat people " like grown-ups " and give the current laws a much-needed overhaul .
' terror success ' in the bbc interview , sir john also reiterated earlier comments calling for the law on protecting yourself against an intruder to be clarified .
he said there needed to be a " presumption of innocence " on anyone who injures an intruder defending their home .
but the biggest challenge - and frustration - facing police was the threat of terrorism , he added .
" the effort that has gone on since 11 september has been absolutely considerable , " he said .
" it is something that we have been very successful on . "
but , he said , their successes could not be publicised or were not always reflected in the press , so officers were not always given credit where credit was due .
he also told how he had changed his mind on the government 's plan to introduce id cards .
he said he had become convinced that being able to be certain of people 's identity was now essential .
sir john also said there had to be a balance between protecting the country and protecting human rights .
" i want to make it absolutely clear that some of the laws that have been introduced have been absolutely essential to safeguarding this country , " he said .

in 2003 , swedes spent £ 17m in scotland .
that figure compared to £ 6m in 2002 , a year when 17,000 people made the trip to scotland .
the visitor figures were calculated from the office of national statistics ' international passenger survey .
encouraging increase it brings together data from scottish airports , excluding prestwick , and sea ports .
tourism minister patricia ferguson said : " this encouraging increase in visitors from sweden is only part of a success story that has seen increasing numbers of tourists visiting from western europe - up 25 % in the first half of this year .
" in 2002 , if visitors from sweden wanted to come here , they had to fly via london .
" that year the scottish executive set up the air route development fund .
there are now two direct flights from sweden supported by the fund . "

the 20,000 all-seater football and rugby arena is being built on former industrial waste ground at landore .
exterior work has nearly been completed and the contractors are now furnishing offices , conference suites , bars and player facilities .
the new stadium will open on 31 july .
although work is only now starting on the pitch - which will need to stand up to the rigours of both football and rugby for nine months of the year - every one of the 20,280 black and white seats are in place .
stadium facts the foundations sit on 1,450 precast concrete piles the west stand upper floor facilities cover a total area of 8,800 square metres the task of installing the huge jigsaw of precast units which form the stadium bowl was completed in july the changing rooms and baths have been designed for 26 players on either side to strengthen the pitch , plastic grass reinforcements will put in place before it is seeded now that is complete and the scoreboards and floodlights installed as well - work over the next months will be less noticeable .
the mechanical and electrical services are being added , along with internal features such as carpets and decor .
the bars and kitchens that will serve the hospitality boxes , lounges and conference areas are also taking shape .
and while there is still a lot to do , it is already clear that , compared to vetch and st helen 's grounds - the current homes of swansea football club and ospreys rugby team - the new stadium promises premiership rather than conference standards .
john evans , senior associate with project managers gardiner and theobold , said it was something the city had been crying out for for years .
swansea host their final christmas match at their old ground against boston on tuesday , while the last league match to be played at the vetch , the club 's home since 1912 , is scheduled to be against shrewsbury on 30 april .
" the vetch has come to the end of its natural lifetime .
it needs lots of money spent on it each year just to meet health and safety standards .
the main stand at st helen 's is like something out of the ark , " said mr evans .
john evans said the stadium will be used all week long areas have been designed for fans with specific disabilities , including the hard-of-hearing , and the hospitality facilities should enable both clubs to earn more money through corporate sponsorship .
" options will range from three-course meals to a pie and a pint , " said mr evans .
some 1,175 luxury seats have been reserved for people joining the ' premier club ' scheme with a lifetime membership fee of £ 1,000 and then regular monthly payments .
over 400 of the packages have been sold since the launch earlier in the month .
when the stadium , funded by swansea council , was designed , it was with the aim of making it a seven-day-a-week facility .
the swans will leave the vetch at the end of the football season as well as the offices , talks are taking place with a view to moving the welsh sports hall of fame from the museum of welsh life at st fagan 's near cardiff .
" they 've got to be able to use the stadium on non-match days in order to bring in income to pay for its running and up-keep , " added mr evans .
" there is the space for big diner dances for up to 600 - there are big areas that can be used for a variety of things . "
