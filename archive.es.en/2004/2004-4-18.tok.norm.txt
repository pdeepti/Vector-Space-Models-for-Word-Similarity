" i did not underestimate myself , and the fact that i am here means that others did not do so either , mainly the voters did not underestimate me , " gasparovic told reporters . veto potential although the office of president is largely ceremonial in slovakia , gasparovic will have an important veto that he could use to block eu-required reforms .
gasparovic , a center-left politician , has not said how he will wield the veto , but he and high-ranking allies have often criticized government reforms saying they hurt everyday slovaks and have kept unemployment high - currently it is at 16 percent . much of his campaign was centered around criticism of the current center-right government although he has been vague about concrete steps he would take if he were elected . despite the slight anti-eu tone to the campaign , after his victory gasparovic pledged he would try to find common ground with prime minister mikulas dzurinda , saying slovakia 's integration into the european club should be smooth . blow for meciar the defeat is a crushing blow for vladimir meciar , who analysts had predicted would pull out a victory after defeating gasparovic in the first round of voting by nearly ten percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir meciar meciar -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was prime minister of slovakia from 1990-1998 , tried to convince voters he was a changed man who had learned from experience to be less combative .

voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win . many slovaks characterized the run-off election for president as a choice between the lesser of two evils - a nationalist former prime minister who earned slovakia isolation in the 1990s with his authoritarian rule , or the man who stood at his side then as parliamentary speaker . but on sunday , the country 's election committee announced that preliminary results showed gasparovic , the former speaker , defeated his former boss and ally with 59.91 percent of the vote in saturday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan gasparovic gasparovic -lrb- photo -rrb- , 63 , won the vote just weeks before slovakia enters the european union on may 1 and will begin his five-year term in mid-june .

voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win . many slovaks characterized the run-off election for president as a choice between the lesser of two evils - a nationalist former prime minister who earned slovakia isolation in the 1990s with his authoritarian rule , or the man who stood at his side then as parliamentary speaker . but on sunday , the country 's election committee announced that preliminary results showed gasparovic , the former speaker , defeated his former boss and ally with 59.91 percent of the vote in saturday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan gasparovic gasparovic -lrb- photo -rrb- , 63 , won the vote just weeks before slovakia enters the european union on may 1 and will begin his five-year term in mid-june . " i did not underestimate myself , and the fact that i am here means that others did not do so either , mainly the voters did not underestimate me , " gasparovic told reporters . veto potential although the office of president is largely ceremonial in slovakia , gasparovic will have an important veto that he could use to block eu-required reforms .
gasparovic , a center-left politician , has not said how he will wield the veto , but he and high-ranking allies have often criticized government reforms saying they hurt everyday slovaks and have kept unemployment high - currently it is at 16 percent . much of his campaign was centered around criticism of the current center-right government although he has been vague about concrete steps he would take if he were elected . despite the slight anti-eu tone to the campaign , after his victory gasparovic pledged he would try to find common ground with prime minister mikulas dzurinda , saying slovakia 's integration into the european club should be smooth . blow for meciar the defeat is a crushing blow for vladimir meciar , who analysts had predicted would pull out a victory after defeating gasparovic in the first round of voting by nearly ten percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir meciar meciar -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was prime minister of slovakia from 1990-1998 , tried to convince voters he was a changed man who had learned from experience to be less combative .
during his time in office , he become a political pariah in the west , where many were highly critical of his crackdown on the media and his authoritarian style . while meciar remains popular in rural areas with his nationalistic platform , voters overall seemed to have rejected his attempt at a makeover . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovakia votes to join european union in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .

voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win . many slovaks characterized the run-off election for president as a choice between the lesser of two evils - a nationalist former prime minister who earned slovakia isolation in the 1990s with his authoritarian rule , or the man who stood at his side then as parliamentary speaker . but on sunday , the country 's election committee announced that preliminary results showed gasparovic , the former speaker , defeated his former boss and ally with 59.91 percent of the vote in saturday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan gasparovic gasparovic -lrb- photo -rrb- , 63 , won the vote just weeks before slovakia enters the european union on may 1 and will begin his five-year term in mid-june . " i did not underestimate myself , and the fact that i am here means that others did not do so either , mainly the voters did not underestimate me , " gasparovic told reporters . veto potential although the office of president is largely ceremonial in slovakia , gasparovic will have an important veto that he could use to block eu-required reforms .
gasparovic , a center-left politician , has not said how he will wield the veto , but he and high-ranking allies have often criticized government reforms saying they hurt everyday slovaks and have kept unemployment high - currently it is at 16 percent . much of his campaign was centered around criticism of the current center-right government although he has been vague about concrete steps he would take if he were elected . despite the slight anti-eu tone to the campaign , after his victory gasparovic pledged he would try to find common ground with prime minister mikulas dzurinda , saying slovakia 's integration into the european club should be smooth . blow for meciar the defeat is a crushing blow for vladimir meciar , who analysts had predicted would pull out a victory after defeating gasparovic in the first round of voting by nearly ten percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir meciar meciar -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was prime minister of slovakia from 1990-1998 , tried to convince voters he was a changed man who had learned from experience to be less combative .
during his time in office , he become a political pariah in the west , where many were highly critical of his crackdown on the media and his authoritarian style . while meciar remains popular in rural areas with his nationalistic platform , voters overall seemed to have rejected his attempt at a makeover . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovakia votes to join european union in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .

voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win . many slovaks characterized the run-off election for president as a choice between the lesser of two evils - a nationalist former prime minister who earned slovakia isolation in the 1990s with his authoritarian rule , or the man who stood at his side then as parliamentary speaker . but on sunday , the country 's election committee announced that preliminary results showed gasparovic , the former speaker , defeated his former boss and ally with 59.91 percent of the vote in saturday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan gasparovic gasparovic -lrb- photo -rrb- , 63 , won the vote just weeks before slovakia enters the european union on may 1 and will begin his five-year term in mid-june . " i did not underestimate myself , and the fact that i am here means that others did not do so either , mainly the voters did not underestimate me , " gasparovic told reporters . veto potential although the office of president is largely ceremonial in slovakia , gasparovic will have an important veto that he could use to block eu-required reforms .
gasparovic , a center-left politician , has not said how he will wield the veto , but he and high-ranking allies have often criticized government reforms saying they hurt everyday slovaks and have kept unemployment high - currently it is at 16 percent . much of his campaign was centered around criticism of the current center-right government although he has been vague about concrete steps he would take if he were elected . despite the slight anti-eu tone to the campaign , after his victory gasparovic pledged he would try to find common ground with prime minister mikulas dzurinda , saying slovakia 's integration into the european club should be smooth . blow for meciar the defeat is a crushing blow for vladimir meciar , who analysts had predicted would pull out a victory after defeating gasparovic in the first round of voting by nearly ten percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir meciar meciar -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was prime minister of slovakia from 1990-1998 , tried to convince voters he was a changed man who had learned from experience to be less combative .

voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win . many slovaks characterized the run-off election for president as a choice between the lesser of two evils - a nationalist former prime minister who earned slovakia isolation in the 1990s with his authoritarian rule , or the man who stood at his side then as parliamentary speaker . but on sunday , the country 's election committee announced that preliminary results showed gasparovic , the former speaker , defeated his former boss and ally with 59.91 percent of the vote in saturday 's election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan gasparovic gasparovic -lrb- photo -rrb- , 63 , won the vote just weeks before slovakia enters the european union on may 1 and will begin his five-year term in mid-june .

gasparovic , a center-left politician , has not said how he will wield the veto , but he and high-ranking allies have often criticized government reforms saying they hurt everyday slovaks and have kept unemployment high - currently it is at 16 percent . much of his campaign was centered around criticism of the current center-right government although he has been vague about concrete steps he would take if he were elected . despite the slight anti-eu tone to the campaign , after his victory gasparovic pledged he would try to find common ground with prime minister mikulas dzurinda , saying slovakia 's integration into the european club should be smooth . blow for meciar the defeat is a crushing blow for vladimir meciar , who analysts had predicted would pull out a victory after defeating gasparovic in the first round of voting by nearly ten percentage points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir meciar meciar -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was prime minister of slovakia from 1990-1998 , tried to convince voters he was a changed man who had learned from experience to be less combative .

he said if it could be proved the seal population was damaging fish stocks , tough decisions should be made .
wildlife campaigners have condemned canada 's decision to cull about 300,000 seals .
scotland has the world 's second largest seal population and mr morrison said that they should be treated like other animals .
activist fury he said : " culls are not unique to the outer hebrides or indeed to other parts of scotland .
" it happens in terms of mink , hedgehog and deer and again , if required , it should also happen with the seal population around the hebrides and around the british isles . "
animal right activists reacted with fury earlier this week when canada launched the largest single seal hunt in half a century .
alasdair morrison : " other species are culled " the canadian government said hunters would be allowed to kill about 350,000 seals this year .
the hunting of young seals for their fur almost stopped in the face of international outrage but with seal numbers increasing and fur again in fashion the hunt has returned .
about 38 % of the world population of grey seals is found in britain and over 90 % of them breed in scotland , the majority in the hebrides and in orkney .
britain is also home to about 40 % of all european common seals and 87 % of them live around scotland in the hebrides and northern isles , the wash , the firth of tay and the moray firth .
