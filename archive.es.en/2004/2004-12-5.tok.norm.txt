affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .

the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels .

" there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .
but - sacre bleu - is n't there a certain contradiction in the french , of all people , so enthusiastically embracing such an american idea ?
multiplex cinemas are one thing , but this concerns what may be the country 's last remaining cultural jewel : la cuisine .
the drive in customers - who , admittedly , have already made their choice - do n't seem to find it a problem .
" why not make like the americans ?
the americans make good things , " said caroline .
one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .
in towns and villages across the country millions of people still walk into bakeries to buy their bread ; the drive-in simply provides a new option for those working on industrial estates or on the outskirts of towns .
as philippe puts it : " we are very quality oriented in france , and as long as the bread is as crunchy and as delicious as in a french boulangerie , i would buy it wherever i find it .

the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .

affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .

affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .
here , life takes place outside , morning , noon and night .
it makes a big difference . " relocating : the healthy choice as germany struggles with its flagging economy , the country 's elderly have come in for plenty of criticism in recent years for appearing to take the money and run . politicians are determined that pensioners will also have to feel the pinch of reforms to the social welfare system , and pension cuts have featured regularly in berlin 's social agenda . nonetheless , studies show that germany 's elderly today enjoy a better standard of living than ever before - and they often leave their native shores to make the most of it . many of the over-sixties populating the mediterranean coast first migrated south on their doctor 's advice .
heart complaints , asthma , arthritis and rheumatism are just some of the ailments soothed by clement climate conditions . hans stallmach suffers from bechterew disease , rheumatoid arthritis of the spine .
back in germany , he relied on painkillers to cope and spent most of his time in bed .
six years ago , he relocated to spain and says he 's never felt better . " the climate was very beneficial for my condition and my health really improved , " he maintained .
" i can lead the sort of life i was n't able to live in germany . " giving something back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return , the pensioners bring spending power and a welcome boost to the local economy by building and buying homes .
their growing presence has also made the area a magnet for the service sector .
southern spain now boasts an excellent infrastructure for senior citizens from northern europe .
the broad array of english-speaking doctors , old people 's homes , banks and workmen means if they want , they do n't even have to learn spanish . the prevalence of a foreign community can , however , be counterproductive , with the pensioners never actually motivated to learn the language and actually integrate locally . according to a recent survey , 96 percent of pensioners in the region cite linguistic problems as their main worry .
it 's enough to send some of them packing . father fritz delp knows the german community along the costa blanca very well .
" some people have been here for as long as twelve years , " he explained .
" they often say they were the best years of their life , but sooner or later they want to go back to germany .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .
besides spending time in beijing , he will also travel to the industrial town of changchun in the northeastern jilin province to address regional business leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
schröder will fly straight from changchun to japan , where he will hold talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
besides planning strategy over their joint desire to join the top league of the un security council , schröder and koizumi may be inclined to discuss the weakness of the us dollar versus the euro and yen . with washington loath to do anything to support the sinking greenback , japan and germany - both big exporters - are suffering .
the endangered prospects for growth in the world 's second and third largest economies could cause both berlin and tokyo to increase pressure on beijing to revalue the chinese yuan 's dollar-peg .

china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .
but - sacre bleu - is n't there a certain contradiction in the french , of all people , so enthusiastically embracing such an american idea ?
multiplex cinemas are one thing , but this concerns what may be the country 's last remaining cultural jewel : la cuisine .
the drive in customers - who , admittedly , have already made their choice - do n't seem to find it a problem .
" why not make like the americans ?
the americans make good things , " said caroline .
one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .
in towns and villages across the country millions of people still walk into bakeries to buy their bread ; the drive-in simply provides a new option for those working on industrial estates or on the outskirts of towns .
as philippe puts it : " we are very quality oriented in france , and as long as the bread is as crunchy and as delicious as in a french boulangerie , i would buy it wherever i find it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2004 schröder 's packed asian agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a direct line to chinese premier wen jiabao on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder embarks on a five-day asian tour to china and japan .
economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2004 schröder 's packed asian agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a direct line to chinese premier wen jiabao on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder embarks on a five-day asian tour to china and japan .
economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .
besides spending time in beijing , he will also travel to the industrial town of changchun in the northeastern jilin province to address regional business leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
schröder will fly straight from changchun to japan , where he will hold talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
besides planning strategy over their joint desire to join the top league of the un security council , schröder and koizumi may be inclined to discuss the weakness of the us dollar versus the euro and yen . with washington loath to do anything to support the sinking greenback , japan and germany - both big exporters - are suffering .
the endangered prospects for growth in the world 's second and third largest economies could cause both berlin and tokyo to increase pressure on beijing to revalue the chinese yuan 's dollar-peg . " if the yuan is decoupled from the dollar it would certainly help german exporters , " andre schwarz from the bga german foreign trade association said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health insurer tackles china a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .

the endangered prospects for growth in the world 's second and third largest economies could cause both berlin and tokyo to increase pressure on beijing to revalue the chinese yuan 's dollar-peg .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .

german police had already traveled to norway to question the founder of their group . german prosecutors issued arrest warrants on saturday for the three men in connection with a suspected plot to attack the iraqi prime minister during his visit to berlin on friday .
the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .
rafik y. , aged 30 , was arrested in the capital berlin , while ata r. , 31 , was detained in stuttgart in the southwest of the country .

" the content of what happened in the oslo court has been classified by the court , so i can not offer concrete comments , " krekar 's lawyer brynjar meling said in an interview on public television . he confirmed however that german police among other things wanted details of his client 's european contacts . asked whether the telephone number of one of the men arrested on friday was found in krekar 's possession , meling told ntb news agency that when krekar was arrested in the netherlands two years ago " he had an electronic phone book containing up to 2,000 names and numbers ... so it is possible that the police found this man 's telephone number at krekar 's " home . meanwhile , krekar 's brother khalid faraj ahmad told ntb that krekar 's interrogation last week was in connection with an old case and that the interview had been planned for months . " he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .
estimates put the number of members at around 1,000 in various splinter groups .
in 2003 , german authorities estimated there to be some 100 members in germany . the group , as founded by militant kurds in northern iraq , is supposed to have offered shelter to osama bin laden 's fighters and ansar al-islam members are said to have spent time in al qaeda training camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the fall of saddam hussein , the group controlled an enclave in northern iraq where their islamic fundamentalist views were enforced .

affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .
here , life takes place outside , morning , noon and night .
it makes a big difference . " relocating : the healthy choice as germany struggles with its flagging economy , the country 's elderly have come in for plenty of criticism in recent years for appearing to take the money and run . politicians are determined that pensioners will also have to feel the pinch of reforms to the social welfare system , and pension cuts have featured regularly in berlin 's social agenda . nonetheless , studies show that germany 's elderly today enjoy a better standard of living than ever before - and they often leave their native shores to make the most of it . many of the over-sixties populating the mediterranean coast first migrated south on their doctor 's advice .
heart complaints , asthma , arthritis and rheumatism are just some of the ailments soothed by clement climate conditions . hans stallmach suffers from bechterew disease , rheumatoid arthritis of the spine .
back in germany , he relied on painkillers to cope and spent most of his time in bed .
six years ago , he relocated to spain and says he 's never felt better . " the climate was very beneficial for my condition and my health really improved , " he maintained .
" i can lead the sort of life i was n't able to live in germany . " giving something back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return , the pensioners bring spending power and a welcome boost to the local economy by building and buying homes .
their growing presence has also made the area a magnet for the service sector .
southern spain now boasts an excellent infrastructure for senior citizens from northern europe .
the broad array of english-speaking doctors , old people 's homes , banks and workmen means if they want , they do n't even have to learn spanish . the prevalence of a foreign community can , however , be counterproductive , with the pensioners never actually motivated to learn the language and actually integrate locally . according to a recent survey , 96 percent of pensioners in the region cite linguistic problems as their main worry .
it 's enough to send some of them packing . father fritz delp knows the german community along the costa blanca very well .
" some people have been here for as long as twelve years , " he explained .
" they often say they were the best years of their life , but sooner or later they want to go back to germany .
they worry about their health and they do n't want anything to happen in a strange country where they do n't speak the language and do n't really feel integrated . " others would n't go back if they were paid .
85-year-old edith teuber used to come here on vacation in the 1960s , and now lives in a german-language nursing home . " anyone who can , should move here , " she advised .
" it 's a lovely place to be when you 're elderly and need sunlight .
germany is unbearable in winter , it 's so dark , foggy and cold .

" the content of what happened in the oslo court has been classified by the court , so i can not offer concrete comments , " krekar 's lawyer brynjar meling said in an interview on public television . he confirmed however that german police among other things wanted details of his client 's european contacts . asked whether the telephone number of one of the men arrested on friday was found in krekar 's possession , meling told ntb news agency that when krekar was arrested in the netherlands two years ago " he had an electronic phone book containing up to 2,000 names and numbers ... so it is possible that the police found this man 's telephone number at krekar 's " home . meanwhile , krekar 's brother khalid faraj ahmad told ntb that krekar 's interrogation last week was in connection with an old case and that the interview had been planned for months . " he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .

the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .
rafik y. , aged 30 , was arrested in the capital berlin , while ata r. , 31 , was detained in stuttgart in the southwest of the country .
the third man , masin h. , 22 , was arrested in the southern city of augsburg . ansar al-islam was founded in 2001 in northern iraq and has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in the country . allawi arrived in berlin late thursday on his first trip to germany since taking office six months ago , at the start of a european tour that will also take him to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german investigators , who had the suspects under surveillance , noticed just before allawi 's arrival an increase in activity , phone calls and suspicious movements by one suspect that amounted to evidence of plans to attack . a fourth man , a lebanese , was arrested saturday in berlin on suspicion of supporting ansar al-islam and his home was searched .

" he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .

german police had already traveled to norway to question the founder of their group . german prosecutors issued arrest warrants on saturday for the three men in connection with a suspected plot to attack the iraqi prime minister during his visit to berlin on friday .
the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .
rafik y. , aged 30 , was arrested in the capital berlin , while ata r. , 31 , was detained in stuttgart in the southwest of the country .
the third man , masin h. , 22 , was arrested in the southern city of augsburg . ansar al-islam was founded in 2001 in northern iraq and has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in the country . allawi arrived in berlin late thursday on his first trip to germany since taking office six months ago , at the start of a european tour that will also take him to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german investigators , who had the suspects under surveillance , noticed just before allawi 's arrival an increase in activity , phone calls and suspicious movements by one suspect that amounted to evidence of plans to attack . a fourth man , a lebanese , was arrested saturday in berlin on suspicion of supporting ansar al-islam and his home was searched .
he was later released . founder questioned ahead of the arrests in germany , the founder ansar al-islam was questioned in oslo by german police , norwegian media reported on sunday .
german police interrogated mullah krekar early last week .
he is thought to be linked to at least one of the men arrested on friday on suspicion of planning attacks during allawi 's visit , norwegian daily vg reported . krekar , who has lived in norway since 1991 , founded the group in december 2001 , but insists that he has not been its leader since may 2002 . " the content of what happened in the oslo court has been classified by the court , so i can not offer concrete comments , " krekar 's lawyer brynjar meling said in an interview on public television . he confirmed however that german police among other things wanted details of his client 's european contacts . asked whether the telephone number of one of the men arrested on friday was found in krekar 's possession , meling told ntb news agency that when krekar was arrested in the netherlands two years ago " he had an electronic phone book containing up to 2,000 names and numbers ... so it is possible that the police found this man 's telephone number at krekar 's " home . meanwhile , krekar 's brother khalid faraj ahmad told ntb that krekar 's interrogation last week was in connection with an old case and that the interview had been planned for months . " he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .
estimates put the number of members at around 1,000 in various splinter groups .
in 2003 , german authorities estimated there to be some 100 members in germany . the group , as founded by militant kurds in northern iraq , is supposed to have offered shelter to osama bin laden 's fighters and ansar al-islam members are said to have spent time in al qaeda training camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the fall of saddam hussein , the group controlled an enclave in northern iraq where their islamic fundamentalist views were enforced .
for example , women who did not wear a veil were mistreated .

it makes a big difference . " relocating : the healthy choice as germany struggles with its flagging economy , the country 's elderly have come in for plenty of criticism in recent years for appearing to take the money and run . politicians are determined that pensioners will also have to feel the pinch of reforms to the social welfare system , and pension cuts have featured regularly in berlin 's social agenda . nonetheless , studies show that germany 's elderly today enjoy a better standard of living than ever before - and they often leave their native shores to make the most of it . many of the over-sixties populating the mediterranean coast first migrated south on their doctor 's advice .

the broad array of english-speaking doctors , old people 's homes , banks and workmen means if they want , they do n't even have to learn spanish . the prevalence of a foreign community can , however , be counterproductive , with the pensioners never actually motivated to learn the language and actually integrate locally . according to a recent survey , 96 percent of pensioners in the region cite linguistic problems as their main worry .
it 's enough to send some of them packing . father fritz delp knows the german community along the costa blanca very well .
" some people have been here for as long as twelve years , " he explained .
" they often say they were the best years of their life , but sooner or later they want to go back to germany .

german police had already traveled to norway to question the founder of their group . german prosecutors issued arrest warrants on saturday for the three men in connection with a suspected plot to attack the iraqi prime minister during his visit to berlin on friday .
the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .
rafik y. , aged 30 , was arrested in the capital berlin , while ata r. , 31 , was detained in stuttgart in the southwest of the country .
the third man , masin h. , 22 , was arrested in the southern city of augsburg . ansar al-islam was founded in 2001 in northern iraq and has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in the country . allawi arrived in berlin late thursday on his first trip to germany since taking office six months ago , at the start of a european tour that will also take him to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german investigators , who had the suspects under surveillance , noticed just before allawi 's arrival an increase in activity , phone calls and suspicious movements by one suspect that amounted to evidence of plans to attack . a fourth man , a lebanese , was arrested saturday in berlin on suspicion of supporting ansar al-islam and his home was searched .
he was later released . founder questioned ahead of the arrests in germany , the founder ansar al-islam was questioned in oslo by german police , norwegian media reported on sunday .
german police interrogated mullah krekar early last week .
he is thought to be linked to at least one of the men arrested on friday on suspicion of planning attacks during allawi 's visit , norwegian daily vg reported . krekar , who has lived in norway since 1991 , founded the group in december 2001 , but insists that he has not been its leader since may 2002 . " the content of what happened in the oslo court has been classified by the court , so i can not offer concrete comments , " krekar 's lawyer brynjar meling said in an interview on public television . he confirmed however that german police among other things wanted details of his client 's european contacts . asked whether the telephone number of one of the men arrested on friday was found in krekar 's possession , meling told ntb news agency that when krekar was arrested in the netherlands two years ago " he had an electronic phone book containing up to 2,000 names and numbers ... so it is possible that the police found this man 's telephone number at krekar 's " home . meanwhile , krekar 's brother khalid faraj ahmad told ntb that krekar 's interrogation last week was in connection with an old case and that the interview had been planned for months . " he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .
estimates put the number of members at around 1,000 in various splinter groups .
in 2003 , german authorities estimated there to be some 100 members in germany . the group , as founded by militant kurds in northern iraq , is supposed to have offered shelter to osama bin laden 's fighters and ansar al-islam members are said to have spent time in al qaeda training camps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the fall of saddam hussein , the group controlled an enclave in northern iraq where their islamic fundamentalist views were enforced .
for example , women who did not wear a veil were mistreated .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .

even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .
but - sacre bleu - is n't there a certain contradiction in the french , of all people , so enthusiastically embracing such an american idea ?
multiplex cinemas are one thing , but this concerns what may be the country 's last remaining cultural jewel : la cuisine .
the drive in customers - who , admittedly , have already made their choice - do n't seem to find it a problem .
" why not make like the americans ?
the americans make good things , " said caroline .
one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .
in towns and villages across the country millions of people still walk into bakeries to buy their bread ; the drive-in simply provides a new option for those working on industrial estates or on the outskirts of towns .
as philippe puts it : " we are very quality oriented in france , and as long as the bread is as crunchy and as delicious as in a french boulangerie , i would buy it wherever i find it .

affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .
here , life takes place outside , morning , noon and night .
it makes a big difference . " relocating : the healthy choice as germany struggles with its flagging economy , the country 's elderly have come in for plenty of criticism in recent years for appearing to take the money and run . politicians are determined that pensioners will also have to feel the pinch of reforms to the social welfare system , and pension cuts have featured regularly in berlin 's social agenda . nonetheless , studies show that germany 's elderly today enjoy a better standard of living than ever before - and they often leave their native shores to make the most of it . many of the over-sixties populating the mediterranean coast first migrated south on their doctor 's advice .
heart complaints , asthma , arthritis and rheumatism are just some of the ailments soothed by clement climate conditions . hans stallmach suffers from bechterew disease , rheumatoid arthritis of the spine .
back in germany , he relied on painkillers to cope and spent most of his time in bed .
six years ago , he relocated to spain and says he 's never felt better . " the climate was very beneficial for my condition and my health really improved , " he maintained .
" i can lead the sort of life i was n't able to live in germany . " giving something back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return , the pensioners bring spending power and a welcome boost to the local economy by building and buying homes .
their growing presence has also made the area a magnet for the service sector .
southern spain now boasts an excellent infrastructure for senior citizens from northern europe .
the broad array of english-speaking doctors , old people 's homes , banks and workmen means if they want , they do n't even have to learn spanish . the prevalence of a foreign community can , however , be counterproductive , with the pensioners never actually motivated to learn the language and actually integrate locally . according to a recent survey , 96 percent of pensioners in the region cite linguistic problems as their main worry .
it 's enough to send some of them packing . father fritz delp knows the german community along the costa blanca very well .
" some people have been here for as long as twelve years , " he explained .
" they often say they were the best years of their life , but sooner or later they want to go back to germany .
they worry about their health and they do n't want anything to happen in a strange country where they do n't speak the language and do n't really feel integrated . " others would n't go back if they were paid .
85-year-old edith teuber used to come here on vacation in the 1960s , and now lives in a german-language nursing home . " anyone who can , should move here , " she advised .
" it 's a lovely place to be when you 're elderly and need sunlight .
germany is unbearable in winter , it 's so dark , foggy and cold .
down here , you experience your old age in a completely different light .

economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .
besides spending time in beijing , he will also travel to the industrial town of changchun in the northeastern jilin province to address regional business leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
schröder will fly straight from changchun to japan , where he will hold talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
besides planning strategy over their joint desire to join the top league of the un security council , schröder and koizumi may be inclined to discuss the weakness of the us dollar versus the euro and yen . with washington loath to do anything to support the sinking greenback , japan and germany - both big exporters - are suffering .
the endangered prospects for growth in the world 's second and third largest economies could cause both berlin and tokyo to increase pressure on beijing to revalue the chinese yuan 's dollar-peg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2004 germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's security apparatus has been in high gear arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .
german police had already traveled to norway to question the founder of their group . german prosecutors issued arrest warrants on saturday for the three men in connection with a suspected plot to attack the iraqi prime minister during his visit to berlin on friday .
the three are being charged with membership in a terrorist organization , ansar al-islam .
the warrants mean the men can be held in custody as german police investigate the case . the three men were arrested on friday after early morning raids in three german cities .
rafik y. , aged 30 , was arrested in the capital berlin , while ata r. , 31 , was detained in stuttgart in the southwest of the country .
the third man , masin h. , 22 , was arrested in the southern city of augsburg . ansar al-islam was founded in 2001 in northern iraq and has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in the country . allawi arrived in berlin late thursday on his first trip to germany since taking office six months ago , at the start of a european tour that will also take him to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german investigators , who had the suspects under surveillance , noticed just before allawi 's arrival an increase in activity , phone calls and suspicious movements by one suspect that amounted to evidence of plans to attack . a fourth man , a lebanese , was arrested saturday in berlin on suspicion of supporting ansar al-islam and his home was searched .
he was later released . founder questioned ahead of the arrests in germany , the founder ansar al-islam was questioned in oslo by german police , norwegian media reported on sunday .
german police interrogated mullah krekar early last week .
he is thought to be linked to at least one of the men arrested on friday on suspicion of planning attacks during allawi 's visit , norwegian daily vg reported . krekar , who has lived in norway since 1991 , founded the group in december 2001 , but insists that he has not been its leader since may 2002 . " the content of what happened in the oslo court has been classified by the court , so i can not offer concrete comments , " krekar 's lawyer brynjar meling said in an interview on public television . he confirmed however that german police among other things wanted details of his client 's european contacts . asked whether the telephone number of one of the men arrested on friday was found in krekar 's possession , meling told ntb news agency that when krekar was arrested in the netherlands two years ago " he had an electronic phone book containing up to 2,000 names and numbers ... so it is possible that the police found this man 's telephone number at krekar 's " home . meanwhile , krekar 's brother khalid faraj ahmad told ntb that krekar 's interrogation last week was in connection with an old case and that the interview had been planned for months . " he was questioned as a witness in a case concerning several kurds who were arrested in germany a long time ago , " ahmad insisted . connection to al qaeda ? according to information from german authorities , the group ansar al-islam -lrb- supporters of islam -rrb- was founded in 2001 .
estimates put the number of members at around 1,000 in various splinter groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2004 schröder 's packed asian agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a direct line to chinese premier wen jiabao on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder embarks on a five-day asian tour to china and japan .
economics and trade will dominate the trip , but a number of important political issues will also top the agenda . when chancellor schröder heads to asia , it 's normally all about helping german business tap the region 's key markets .
in the past berlin has made a considerable effort to aid industry and the government is planning to do the same on this trip . " certainly economic topics will be an important focus of the trip in both china and japan .
the chancellor will be travelling with a large business delegation , " according to a government spokesman . but there are signs that politics may not take such a backseat to business this time around .
china 's leadership has several pressing issues to discuss with schröder , including the possible lifting of the eu 's weapon 's embargo against beijing .
berlin , on the other hand , wants chinese backing for germany 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council .
that 's something japan also is aiming for , and tokyo and berlin are sure to talk strategy over the upcoming reform of the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao while germany 's political relationship with japan is well established , ties to china are rapidly evolving .
following a visit by chinese premier wen jiabao to germany in may , he and schröder agreed to set up a hotline linking berlin with beijing .
the secure telephone line is modelled on the dedicated hotlines the german leader has to the white house in washington and the kremlin in moscow and shows just how seriously both sides now take political contact at the highest levels . " it appears the leaders are even developing personal contacts , " dr eberhard sandschneider from the german council on foreign relations said , adding that the new dimension in the countries ' relationship was being driven by the realization that both sides potential had much to gain from closer ties . schröder supports lifting embargo besides solidifying german support for the lifting of the eu weapons embargo imposed on china after pro-democracy protests on tiananmen square were bloodily crushed in 1989 , beijing wants brussels to accord it " market economy " status .
sandschneider said schröder 's support for the weapon embargo would have little benefit for the german economy , however , it could be key in making china more willing to back germany in other endeavors such as berlin 's quest for a permanent un security council seat . " there is not much of an argument for the embargo anymore .
but the symbolism is very important .
you do n't want to send the message that europe is selling weapons to beijing that could end up in the taiwan straight , " said sandschneider , explaining that schröder needed to tread lightly on the issue . some analysts said china was also keen to groom contacts to european powers like germany and france in order to shore up its official stance on a " multi-polar " world that was n't dominated by the only remaining superpower , the united states .
however , both beijing and berlin ultimately have a sober view of the limits of their political cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- and former eu commission president romano prodi in brussels in may " in theory the chinese would like to counterbalance the united states , but they are aware of the eu 's internal divisions and difficulties , " dr kay möller from the german institute for international politics and security affairs in berlin said .
" and the europeans are coming to realize they had the same problems with beijing regarding opening the chinese economy and on human rights that the americans have . " that cold political reality means few doubt berlin is about to start neglecting german business interests in its dealings with beijing . " germany 's policies toward china are still dominated by economics - everything else takes a back seat , " möller said . plenty of pr during his visit , schröder will attend several pr events for big-name german firms including carmakers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen .
besides spending time in beijing , he will also travel to the industrial town of changchun in the northeastern jilin province to address regional business leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
schröder will fly straight from changchun to japan , where he will hold talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
besides planning strategy over their joint desire to join the top league of the un security council , schröder and koizumi may be inclined to discuss the weakness of the us dollar versus the euro and yen . with washington loath to do anything to support the sinking greenback , japan and germany - both big exporters - are suffering .
the endangered prospects for growth in the world 's second and third largest economies could cause both berlin and tokyo to increase pressure on beijing to revalue the chinese yuan 's dollar-peg . " if the yuan is decoupled from the dollar it would certainly help german exporters , " andre schwarz from the bga german foreign trade association said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health insurer tackles china a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2004 why germans love the costa blanca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pensioners : twilight years in the blazing sun forget those unsightly images of sun-burnt , beer-swilling hooligans living it up on spain 's costa blanca .
affordable property and good weather are still luring germans to southern spain - but most of them are over 60 . at market day in moraira , a picturesque resort in southern spain , it 's 20 degrees in the shade and a pale december sun is shining down on the crowds .
hordes of elderly people are strolling through the fruit and vegetable stalls , or soaking up rays over coffee in the back-to-back pavement cafés lining the seafront . living the good life it 's not a commercial for a life insurance plan , it 's just day-to-day reality on the costa blanca .
most of the pensioners milling around the town come from germany , britain , scandinavia , austria and switzerland .
they 've all headed south in search of the good life , and most of them agree that the pleasant climate alone was worth pulling up roots for . others only winter in spain , trading bochum for the balearics and enjoying both the weather and the relaxed southern joie de vivre they say they miss up north , where both the temperatures and the people tend to be on the frosty side . " you can go swimming outside here , play tennis , have dinner with friends - all activities you do n't do so often back in germany , " explained horst sellmer from northern germany .
" at home , you 're glad to get inside during the winter months .
here , life takes place outside , morning , noon and night .
it makes a big difference . " relocating : the healthy choice as germany struggles with its flagging economy , the country 's elderly have come in for plenty of criticism in recent years for appearing to take the money and run . politicians are determined that pensioners will also have to feel the pinch of reforms to the social welfare system , and pension cuts have featured regularly in berlin 's social agenda . nonetheless , studies show that germany 's elderly today enjoy a better standard of living than ever before - and they often leave their native shores to make the most of it . many of the over-sixties populating the mediterranean coast first migrated south on their doctor 's advice .
heart complaints , asthma , arthritis and rheumatism are just some of the ailments soothed by clement climate conditions . hans stallmach suffers from bechterew disease , rheumatoid arthritis of the spine .
back in germany , he relied on painkillers to cope and spent most of his time in bed .
six years ago , he relocated to spain and says he 's never felt better . " the climate was very beneficial for my condition and my health really improved , " he maintained .
" i can lead the sort of life i was n't able to live in germany . " giving something back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return , the pensioners bring spending power and a welcome boost to the local economy by building and buying homes .
their growing presence has also made the area a magnet for the service sector .
southern spain now boasts an excellent infrastructure for senior citizens from northern europe .
the broad array of english-speaking doctors , old people 's homes , banks and workmen means if they want , they do n't even have to learn spanish . the prevalence of a foreign community can , however , be counterproductive , with the pensioners never actually motivated to learn the language and actually integrate locally . according to a recent survey , 96 percent of pensioners in the region cite linguistic problems as their main worry .
it 's enough to send some of them packing . father fritz delp knows the german community along the costa blanca very well .
" some people have been here for as long as twelve years , " he explained .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .

one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .
in towns and villages across the country millions of people still walk into bakeries to buy their bread ; the drive-in simply provides a new option for those working on industrial estates or on the outskirts of towns .
as philippe puts it : " we are very quality oriented in france , and as long as the bread is as crunchy and as delicious as in a french boulangerie , i would buy it wherever i find it .

for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .
but - sacre bleu - is n't there a certain contradiction in the french , of all people , so enthusiastically embracing such an american idea ?
multiplex cinemas are one thing , but this concerns what may be the country 's last remaining cultural jewel : la cuisine .
the drive in customers - who , admittedly , have already made their choice - do n't seem to find it a problem .
" why not make like the americans ?
the americans make good things , " said caroline .
one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .
in towns and villages across the country millions of people still walk into bakeries to buy their bread ; the drive-in simply provides a new option for those working on industrial estates or on the outskirts of towns .
as philippe puts it : " we are very quality oriented in france , and as long as the bread is as crunchy and as delicious as in a french boulangerie , i would buy it wherever i find it .

but make it snappy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the traditional french bakery go the way of the dinosaurs ?
the appearance in france of the first drive-through boulangerie begs the question : is it one small step for france , or another sign of us cultural hegemony in europe ?
the answer is : both . few people defend their own culture and lifestyle more forcefully than the french , especially when it comes to food .
for many , the trip to the bakery to buy their baguette is a daily ritual , often involving a friendly chat with the boulanger , or baker .
but in the nondescript paris suburb of marly-le-roi , the old tradition now has a distinctly american-style competitor .
anyone watching from the outside as a steady stream of cars pulls into what looks like a disused warehouse would wonder what all those cars were doing there .
in fact , the grey building is the joly bakery .
and the drivers aren ’ t filling their tanks , they 're filling their stomachs .
please stay seated actually , the building used to be a gas station , but there 's no longer any diesel or lead-free for sale here .
instead , as in any boulangerie , or bakery , there are sandwiches , desserts and cold drinks .
but the difference here is , the customers do n't have to get out of their cars to be served .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's future drivers stay seated at the wheel of their cars and order at the drive-through window , much as they would at one of the thousands of mcdonalds that increasingly pepper the european landscape .
caroline , who drives up to the window with four rather large dogs in the back of her hatchback , says the time-saving drive-through is a godsend .
" french people are running all the time .
even the moms to get the kids at school .
they 're always in the car going quick , quick , quick , " she said .
" i think it ’ s a very good concept because you don ’ t have to check for a place , get out the car , stand in the queue for buying bread . "
old habits die hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even on the go , the french have n't fallen completely under the sway of american beliefs in " the faster the better " type service .
habits of politesse and " la vie douce " are deeply ingrained .
the french like presentation .
for the americans , form definitely follows function .
for example , some customers can ’ t quite get used to the idea of being served at the wheel of their car , and as long as there ’ s no long line behind them many still get out of the cars to order .
and despite the emphasis on speed , customers and staff still find time to exchange a few friendly words .
also , unlike at the reviled mcdonald 's drive-through , this counter is open .
no speaking into a loudspeaker to a stranger and having your food shoved at you by a surly , anonymous server .
" it ’ s a mix of american culture and french culture .
it ’ s taking the best of the two cultures , " said jocelyne joly , who helps run the family business .
" the people are friendly , and chatty ..
it ’ s the same as any other boulangerie , the only difference is they come by car .
-lrb- for people who -rrb- work outside town centers , there are no shops , no boulangeries , and so it ’ s great if they can drive to buy their lunch , " she added .
part of a larger trend indeed , the drive-in boulangerie can be seen as a response to another aspect of the creeping americanization of europe : the demise of thriving town centers with numerous small shops in favor of industrial zones on the outskirts full of big-box stores and shopping centers .
in many respects , however , the boulangerie joly is typically french .
the bread is baked on the premises and delivered by lift to the shop below .
but - sacre bleu - is n't there a certain contradiction in the french , of all people , so enthusiastically embracing such an american idea ?
multiplex cinemas are one thing , but this concerns what may be the country 's last remaining cultural jewel : la cuisine .
the drive in customers - who , admittedly , have already made their choice - do n't seem to find it a problem .
" why not make like the americans ?
the americans make good things , " said caroline .
one customer , philippe , knows a thing or two about american habits , having lived in pennsylvania once upon a time .
he chooses to drive three miles round trip from his office to buy his sandwich while staying seated in his car , because it saves him time and has reduced his lunch break to a lightning fast -lrb- in french terms anyway -rrb- 40 minutes .
' a nice model ' he sees no problem with blurring the lines between french and american culture in general .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's restaurant , munich , germany , photo 1996/9 / 19 " we -lrb- french -rrb- have mcdonald-drive-ins , young people listen to american music , american rap , " he said .
" it ’ s really an adaptation of an american system into a french system .
it ’ s a nice business model . "
the jolys hope they can expand their business by opening up other drive-ins elsewhere in france .
perhaps surprisingly , there ’ s been no outcry in the french media at the potential threat to the traditional two-hour lunch .

ten paid staff left the centre in 2004 and many volunteers resigned saying they could not offer the service children deserved .
but five local mps have stepped in to help raise funds needed to recruit more paid staff to run the centre .
last year 17,000 children rang childline 's nottingham office .
' compromise reached ' ten full-time staff took voluntary redundancy in october leaving just one full-time supervisor .
the agreement to help raise funds was reached after broxtowe mp nick palmer mediated between management and staff at childline .
he said : " there 's a big base of volunteers in nottingham and i felt it would be an enormous shame if that expertise were lost .
" so i was very keen to broker a compromise to enable the volunteers to carry on . "
the other politicians supporting the move are nottingham area mps paddy tipping , graham allan , john heppel and alan simpson .
the next challenge is to find new premises - as the charity has to leave its current building .
the charity was set up in 1986 by former tv presenter esther rantzen .

the carnegie building , a gift from the billionaire philanthropist andrew carnegie , was opened in 1903 as a public library and museum .
the restoration will cost more than £ 1m and is expected to take nine months .
the building , which has remained empty since its use as a library ended in 1993 , will house the council 's library section and sports development team .
original features north hartlepool partnership has donated £ 500,000 to the cost , hartlepool council has contributed £ 320,000 , and a £ 297,000 grant was awarded from the heritage lottery fund .
the work involves carefully restoring and preserving the building 's original features , such as the wood panelling , mosaic flooring , a stained glass window and rare pitch pine doorframes .

optimism in 1979 has failed to develop into close ties the detention of israeli druze businessman azzam azzam by egypt had long been a point of contention between them .
his release comes days after egypt 's foreign minister and intelligence chief met the israeli prime minister in jerusalem .
cairo is also reported to be considering sending an ambassador back to tel aviv after a long absence , and take on a security role in gaza with israel due to pull out next year .
icy relations after the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 , israel spent 30 years at war with its giant neighbour and another 25 years in what both sides admit is a cold peace .
the wars and subsequent peace have always been determined by the palestinian situation .
both sides have too much to lose from abandoning the status quo so after the outbreak of the palestinian intifada -lrb- uprising -rrb- in september 2000 , relations became positively icy .
cairo backed away abruptly - withdrawing its ambassador and spearheading arab opposition to israel 's policies in the occupied territories .
israel meanwhile has been highly critical of the egyptian government for allowing - as israeli sees it - a vicious anti-israeli attitude to prevail in the media .
what egypt has never done is repudiate the 1979 egypt-israel peace treaty which was meant to define relations between the two countries .
these included the de-militarisation of the sinai peninsula , normal diplomatic , economic and cultural relations , the free movement of goods and people and mutual protection under the law .
the treaty is also the basis of egypt 's strong ties with the united states and the billions of dollars of american aid it has received since it was signed .
historic breakthrough there was a great sense of optimism back in the late 1970s and early 80s , when the then egyptian and israeli leaders won nobel prizes for their role in agreeing the first peace treaty between israel and an arab state .
in november 1977 , egypt 's president anwar sadat broke the long and bloody impasse by flying to israel to deliver a message of peace directly to its leaders .
his offer was conditional on israel 's pulling out of all the territories it occupied in the 1967 war , including egypt 's sinai peninsula .
a year later , days of talks at the us presidential retreat in maryland resulted in the camp david accords , laying out israel 's commitment to withdraw from sinai in exchange for normalising relations with egypt .
they also included a formula for a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian issue , giving palestinians autonomy in the west bank and gaza .
the peace treaty was finally agreed and signed on 26 march 1979 .
future questions for israel it was a major breakthrough , though it meant giving up all the strategic advantage gained by seizing sinai in 1967 .
for egypt , it meant an end to a long and draining conflict , but it also brought hostility and years of being ostracised by arab allies for allowing itself - the most potent arab military power - to drop out of the arab-israeli conflict .
it also sealed sadat 's fate .
he was assassinated by egyptian islamic militants during a military parade on 6 october 1981 .
in many ways , the future of egyptian-israeli relations is secure - or as secure as anything in the middle east in its current state .
both sides have too much to lose from abandoning the status quo .
some israeli analysts wonder how egypt will position itself towards israel following the departure of its long-standing leader , hosni mubarak .
there is also the question of how the israeli-palestinian conflict will develop in the aftermath of yasser arafat 's death , not to mention the us " war on terror " , which has caused much anguish for egypt and america 's other allies in the region .
