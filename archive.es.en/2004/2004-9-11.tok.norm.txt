on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.09.2004 galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was shocked into action by the madrid bombings on march 11 two weeks after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .

11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

" we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .

indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .

on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .

in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.09.2004 eu finance ministers debate loosening euro pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want more time to balance budgets at a meeting in the dutch coastal resort of scheveningen , the eu ’ s finance chiefs discuss ways of reforming the stability and growth pact that guarantees the solid course of europe ’ s common currency . led by the dutch eu presidency and its finance minister , gerrit zalm , the politicians on friday and saturday discussed a plan by european commissioner joaquin alumunia for easing certain provisions in the pact .
most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .

juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .

11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.09.2004 eu finance ministers debate loosening euro pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want more time to balance budgets at a meeting in the dutch coastal resort of scheveningen , the eu ’ s finance chiefs discuss ways of reforming the stability and growth pact that guarantees the solid course of europe ’ s common currency . led by the dutch eu presidency and its finance minister , gerrit zalm , the politicians on friday and saturday discussed a plan by european commissioner joaquin alumunia for easing certain provisions in the pact .
most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .
just hammering together an agreement on the calculation of corporate profits and taxable earnings will take years , according to dutch finance minister gerrit zalm . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.09.2004 galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was shocked into action by the madrid bombings on march 11 two weeks after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .
but neither side was able to seriously threaten the other , leaving the ruhr valley with a well deserved high-scoring draw . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de confident germany hold brazil in friendly draw the german contingent in the 74,000-strong crowd that packed out the new look olympic stadium in berlin on wednesday night were pleasantly surprised to see a positive , attacking germany team draw 1-1 with brazil .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .

but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.09.2004 galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was shocked into action by the madrid bombings on march 11 two weeks after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .

this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .
but neither side was able to seriously threaten the other , leaving the ruhr valley with a well deserved high-scoring draw . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de confident germany hold brazil in friendly draw the german contingent in the 74,000-strong crowd that packed out the new look olympic stadium in berlin on wednesday night were pleasantly surprised to see a positive , attacking germany team draw 1-1 with brazil .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .

" we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle .

our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .

streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .

but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .

this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.09.2004 galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was shocked into action by the madrid bombings on march 11 two weeks after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .

11 .
a year ago , swedish foreign minister anna lindh was stabbed to death in a department store as horrified shoppers watched . a young girl lays a card at the katarina kyrka cemetery in stockholm , sweden .
it ’ s adorned with a picture of heaven she drew and the words : “ you were our guiding light , we are following in your footsteps . ” as people in new york and washington gathered to remember their loved ones lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks , swedish citizens on saturday collectively remembered the tragedy that struck them on the same day two years later : the murder of foreign minister anna lindh , one of the country ’ s most beloved politicians and a name often tipped as a successor to prime minister göran persson . in an interview with sweden ’ s tv4 , persson recalled last year ’ s tragic events , saying he still couldn ’ t believe it happened .
with the death of the popular politician , he said , he had lost his “ love of politics and his job . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of late swedish foreign minister anna lindh framed with flowers .
at lindh ’ s grave and at the site of her fatal attack , countless stockholm residents laid flowers and cards in remembrance of the foreign minister .
earlier this week , on thursday , the city also christened a glass sculpture in memory of lindh .
the three-meter high sculpture , set at the last square where lindh gave a public speech , is cut so that it cascades a rainbow of colors on sunny days . stabbed whilst shopping on sept .
10 , 2003 , the mentally disturbed mijailo mijailovic , a 25 year-old swede of serbian origin , stabbed lindh at the posh nk department store as she was shopping .
she died one day later from serious internal injuries .
the attack on the social democratic politician set the country into a deep state of shock .
though it was normal for swedish politicians to travel without body guards , lindh ’ s murder wasn ’ t the first of a top-level politician in the country .
in 1986 , a still unidentified assailant killed prime minister olof palme .
but with a strong political future ahead of her , lindh ’ s killing was especially disturbing .
in an editorial published this weekend , the swedish daily svenska dagbladet wrote that the attack was “ the day we will never forget . ”
he killer “ took her last hope of a safe and danger-free society ” with him , it continued .
“ it was as if the world stood still , ” and “ sweden and the world were joined in collective sorrow . ”
in march , a court convicted mijailovic and sentenced him to a life prison term , but an appeals court later threw out the sentence and ordered that he be sent to a secure psychiatric facility for treatment .
germany 's fischer plans speech on saturday afternoon , german foreign minister joschka fischer and the european union ’ s high commissioner for external relations , javier solana , were both planning to give speeches to anti-violence demonstrations and television shows in the swedish capital scheduled on the first anniversary of lindh ’ s death . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court overturns lindh killer 's life sentence the man who killed the swedish foreign minister anna lindh last year has had the life prison sentence imposed on him thrown out by an appeals court in sweden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .

but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

it ’ s adorned with a picture of heaven she drew and the words : “ you were our guiding light , we are following in your footsteps . ” as people in new york and washington gathered to remember their loved ones lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks , swedish citizens on saturday collectively remembered the tragedy that struck them on the same day two years later : the murder of foreign minister anna lindh , one of the country ’ s most beloved politicians and a name often tipped as a successor to prime minister göran persson . in an interview with sweden ’ s tv4 , persson recalled last year ’ s tragic events , saying he still couldn ’ t believe it happened .

“ it was as if the world stood still , ” and “ sweden and the world were joined in collective sorrow . ”

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .

juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .

foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .
but neither side was able to seriously threaten the other , leaving the ruhr valley with a well deserved high-scoring draw . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de confident germany hold brazil in friendly draw the german contingent in the 74,000-strong crowd that packed out the new look olympic stadium in berlin on wednesday night were pleasantly surprised to see a positive , attacking germany team draw 1-1 with brazil .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .
just hammering together an agreement on the calculation of corporate profits and taxable earnings will take years , according to dutch finance minister gerrit zalm . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european commission to loosen stability pact the european commission on friday unveiled a plan to introduce more flexibility in the stability and growth pact , saying it was vital to restore the credibility of its much-flouted budget discipline rules .

the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague .

" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .
but madsen was unable to convert it as warmuz luckily saw the deflected ball bounce on the cross bar . after throwing away the chance to retake the lead , bochum saw themselves go behind in the 59th minute after ewerthon headed in a corner kick .
dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .

11 , 2001 , attacks on the us , the eu agreed to work more closely to fight terrorism .
but little actually changed until europeans realized , years later , that they were threatened by terror too . it took the bombs in commuter trains that killed 191 people in madrid on march 11 , 2004 for european union leaders to recognize that they had to cooperate to fight terrorism and that they had to act more quickly . " we have to do everything so we can operate as preventively and efficiently as possible , to be able to operate across borders , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said at the time .
" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle . " we have looked at europol allowing police organizations to exchange information .
our public prosecutors and others exchange information through eurojust so that they can work better together across borders .
we put laws in place against the financing of terrorism .
terrorists need money .
we must make sure they do n't get it .
and , again , that takes international cooperation . " the 25 eu member states will continue pursuing terrorists themselves .
europe does n't have a police force and does n't plan to establish its own intelligence agency , according to de vries .
recently though , germany and italy were among the last eu states to endorse establishing european arrest warrants which will make it easier to arrest criminals throughout the bloc . transcontinental cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , friday 03 september 2004 .
streams of hostages fled the besieged school in beslan in southern russia friday amid intensive shooting and a series of powerful explosions that signalled a bloody end to the three-day stand-off with terrorists .
foto : yuri kochetkov dpa in the wake of the bloody hostage-taking in southern russian beslan , dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , called for improved transcontinental cooperation . " there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .
what we need is an increased exchange of information , " bot said .
" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .
if we can pool them , we can fight terrorism more effectively . " after long negotiations , the eu finally agreed to exchange information on airplane passengers with the united states .
but data protection advocates are critical of the long lists of information .
starting in 2004 , eu states will issue their citizens passports with biometric data , such as finger prints and digital photos , that will make it more difficult to forge them .
the eu will crackdown harder on illegal immigration .
both steps have also been harshly criticized by human rights groups . taking action anti-terror coordinator de vries lamented that europe is sometimes viewed as being too weak on terror .
in contrast , he drew attention to the europe-wide police raids that resulted in the arrests of terrorists involved in the madrid bombings .
four further attacks had thus been hindered , he said . " these services ca n't put their secrets in the papers .
when you prevent something , you do n't see that something happening .
so sometimes the successes are less easy to spot but they are real , " de vries said . nato , which , along with the eu , has its headquarters in brussels , assured russia its support in the fight against terrorism .
but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .
11 , 2001 , is still in effect .
thus , president george w. bush could theoretically request nato support in the fight against terror .
it would be up to the nato states to decide whether they would fulfill his wishes . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

but russia 's announcement that it will pursue suspected terrorists abroad was not well received in the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
military preventive strikes do not belong to the eu 's methods , a spokeswoman said .
russia has repeatedly criticized european countries and the united states , which it claims provides asylum to chechnyan terror suspects . even now , article 5 of nato 's washington treaty , which states that an armed attack against one or more nato member country will be considered an attack against all and was invoked after sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.09.2004 eu finance ministers debate loosening euro pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want more time to balance budgets at a meeting in the dutch coastal resort of scheveningen , the eu ’ s finance chiefs discuss ways of reforming the stability and growth pact that guarantees the solid course of europe ’ s common currency . led by the dutch eu presidency and its finance minister , gerrit zalm , the politicians on friday and saturday discussed a plan by european commissioner joaquin alumunia for easing certain provisions in the pact .
most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .

dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.09.2004 poles vote to seek war reparations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbolic atonement may no longer be enough to appease the poles tensions between germany and poland over wwii reparations are heating-up .
on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

it was a match packed with emotion and action including a penalty kick and an own goal . the ruhr derby in bochum was a match that keep fans on both sides on the edge of their seats .
the 32,000 spectators had plenty of reasons to be heated up in the sold out stadium .
in the week prior to the match there had been a war of words between dortmund 's sunday oliseh and his former coach at bochum peter neururer . " before the match it was difficult , " said oliseh , who had to leave bochum after breaking the nose of a fellow player last season .
" it was hard because i played with my heart here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going into the game , bochum was in fifth place and they remain unbeaten , but the team has only one win this season .
dortmund , three places behind before the match also wanted three points from their rivals 20 minutes down the autobahn . after starting out cautiously , the action got underway in the 16th minute as bochum 's raymond kalla scored with a header after captain dariusz wosz set up his shot .
dortmund 's defense was very wobbly in the early part of the game and only after the bvb started attacking again in the end of the first half did the team seem settle into a rhythm . after the break dortmund came out much stronger and czech giant jan koller promptly scored the equalizer in the 48th minute .
it was a free kick taken by oliseh that set up koller 's shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only minutes later , the bvb keeper guillaume warmuz unnecessarily fouled a bochum player and the referee called for a penalty kick .

dortmund seemed to have the upper hand after that goal .
but bochum never gave up , which would eventually pay off in the 75th minute . it was then that lokvenc smashed a shot at close range into the bvb goalie .
the deflected shot was then put in the goal by dortmund 's guy demel for an own goal and the equalizer .
that encouraged bochum to renew the attack and try and snatch a win in the waning minutes of the match .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .
the claims of those displaced and their descendents have only opened old wounds , with many remembering the widespread devastation inflicted by the nazis , including the almost complete destruction of the capital warsaw . on a visit to the polish capital last month , chancellor schröder said he would urge german courts to reject claims made by the prussian claims society and similar groups .
but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .
a member of the opposition christian democrats and expert on poland , claudia nolte , however , said the move " unnecessarily escalated " bilateral relations . should germany be forced to pay reparations , the cost could exceed € 525 billion -lrb- $ 640 billion -rrb- , according to the latest estimates . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw .

on friday , the polish parliament voted to seek damages from germany . the lower house of the polish parliament voted unanimously on friday to seek compensation from germany for damages suffered during world war ii .
the resolution passed with a vote of 328-0 , with one abstention . " poland has not received its due financial compensation or war damages for the enormous damage and material and nonmaterial losses caused by the german aggression , occupation , genocide and loss of independence , " the resolution said .
more than 6 million poles were killed during the nazi occupation of the country . at the same time , the resolution stated that the polish government had " no financial obligations whatsoever toward german citizens , " thereby rebuffing recent claims by german groups like the prussian claims society to be compensated for property lost when the polish borders shifted westward at the end of the war . the flap between the two neighbors - an issue since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 - has heated up since poland joined the european union in may of 2004 . poles responding to german claims german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to sooth irritated poles , who have little sympathy for germans forced to flee the far eastern regions of the country when they were transferred to poland at the end of the war .

but that does not appear to have been enough to put a lid on the issue ; today 's resolution is considered a direct reaction to german claims . the resolution is largely symbolic , not binding , and is largely considered to be an attempt by parliamentarians to put pressure on polish prime minister marek belka to bring up the issue with chancellor schröder directly . germany could be asked to pay billions the foreign ministry declined to comment on the latest developments , saying schröder 's speech in warsaw made their position clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.09.2004 eu finance ministers debate loosening euro pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want more time to balance budgets at a meeting in the dutch coastal resort of scheveningen , the eu ’ s finance chiefs discuss ways of reforming the stability and growth pact that guarantees the solid course of europe ’ s common currency . led by the dutch eu presidency and its finance minister , gerrit zalm , the politicians on friday and saturday discussed a plan by european commissioner joaquin alumunia for easing certain provisions in the pact .
most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”

most of the eu finance ministers support giving heavily indebted countries more time to clean up their budget acts before they musst face sanctions from brussels .
but some , including the netherland ’ s zalm , are still calling for the pact ’ s strict 3 percent deficit spending cap to be preserved and better observed .
“ it ’ s a nasty subject , a delicate subject , ” zalm said , “ so you must not expect us to finish the debate , but maybe we can find some common ground for future work .
however , no decision is expected in the matter before 2005 .
german finance minister hans eichel - whose country , like france , will this year oversee a budget that crosses the 3 percent deficit spending cap - supports the proposal for making the rules more flexible .
he also defended greater flexibility , saying it would not weaken the pack .
“ it has to be applied with economic logic , ” eichel said . “ and that means you can ’ t try to consolidate -lrb- your budget -rrb- when you ’ re in the middle of an economic hole .
instead , you do it when you ’ re experiencing good times economically . ”
looser interpretation under alumunia ’ s plan , brussels would provide more exceptions from pact-regulated sanctions during difficult economic periods .
nevertheless , the european commission is still planning to resume its deficit-related proceedings against germany , which were illegally stopped by the council of ministers in november .
still , eichel and berlin need not fear strict conditions being placed on the german budget by brussels .
on friday , the german central bank criticized the european commission ’ s plan to loosen the stability pact , saying it would undermine the body ’ s own credibility and that the plan would weaken the central banks ’ roles as “ guardian ” of the currency .
the bank also said the signatories of the stability pact were aware of its stringent deficit guidelines when they signed on .
but eichel defended the eu against the criticism , saying it would not weaken the pact .
“ no , it doesn ’ t .
that ’ s an nonsensical interpretation , ” he said .
the finance ministers on friday elected luxembourg ’ s jean-claude juncker as chairman of the euro group for the next two years .
the body is comprised of the finance ministers from the 12 european union countries that have adopted the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
juncker , who is also luxembourg ’ s prime minister , will begin his job as the so-called “ mr. euro ” on jan .
1 .
juncker is expected to better represent the euro abroad and also lobby the european central bank , which is responsible for currency and interest rate policies , on behalf of the euro zone foreign ministers .
france has long been pushing for a unified governance of the european economy that would be dictated by the finance ministers , but other countries have demanded that the european central bank remain independent in its policy-making activities .
debate over corporate taxes in new eu states on saturday , the ministers were also expected to discuss corporate taxes in the new eu member states that some western european countries have criticized as “ dumping price ” rates that give them an unfair advantage in attracting foreign investment .
both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

both german chancellor gerhard schröder and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy have slammed the low tax rates in the countries , and sarkozy has called for the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate .
but the mostly eastern european countries have mostly been unwilling to budge , saying the low taxes , which in some cases are as low as one-third of those rates in the old eu states , are necessary to attract businesses .
“ to begin with , we need a common base for tax , and then we need to look at the facts , ” germany ’ s eichel said .
“ in the long-term i am , as you know , a supporter of a minimum tax rate in europe .
that doesn ’ t preclude competition . ”
nevertheless , few expect a minimum tax rate can be imposed because tax law is now , as before , a competency that is determined at the national level and not in brussels .

indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .

" europe as a whole faces a challenge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries is the eu 's first anti-terrorism coordinator .
the european union appointed gijs de vries -lrb- photo -rrb- their anti-terror coordinator and he was charged with improving communication and the exchange of information among the numerous european intelligence services and police departments .
de vries plans in september to establish a body to coordinate the various security services and to take steps to strengthen the european justice agencies europol and eurojust in the hague . " we are creating in brussels a place where our national services can work together to analyze the trends in terrorism , " de vries told deutsche welle .

" there is a growing awareness that we have to do more , first of all , in the european union itself , " bot said .
" but in trips that i made recently to asia and the middle east , i 've also stressed the fact that we must cooperate more closely between all continents .

" you dispose of many facts and information ; we have our special sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2004 opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three yeears out , bin laden is still on the loose - and america still issues terror warnings to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says . america is a nation at war , says george w. bush again and again .
indeed , three years after the terror attacks of september 11 , the last remaining superpower has proved itself to be a real bruiser .
and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

and yet it is more vulnerable than ever before in its history : in iraq more than a thousand u.s. soldiers are dead , in afghanistan the struggle continues , and the united states continues to issue terror alarms within its own borders .
bildunterschrift : miodrag soric there is no way to achieve 100 percent protection against terrorist attacks .
especially given that the terrorists are groups whose bounds know no borders and who are only loosely connected with one another .
what holds them together is a dangerous mixture of hatred and rejection of their own corrupt regimes - and at the same time hatred of the west , which has supported these regimes .
and with western politics comes a rejection of their own culture and religion .
though the presence of this hatred is n't new -lrb- the only new part is the intensity of its violence , -rrb- americans keep asking themselves where such intense hate could possibly come from .
and they continue to miss the concept that they added to it themselves , in various ways - via cronyism with third world dictators and through a lack of interest in the developments and problems of the rest of the world , for example .
a quick look at the u.s. evening television news makes it clear that international themes are largely ignored .
the american public is satisfied to see only itself on screen ; its image of the world is firmly established and unshakeable .
new mental map even europe is n't spared .
the u.s. view of europe is thus : when it comes down to it , the british are on the side of washington , the french against it .
on this mental map , germany lies somewhere in between the two .
that some europeans failed to unquestioningly support the usa in its war on iraq - as they did during the cold war - disappointed the bush administration .
and it left wounds , which can still be seen today .
for instance , in the form of questions over the value of nato .
this , although nato has joined in the fight against terrorism , and although european critics of the iraq war cooperate with washington fully when it comes to questions of terrorism .
and do n't just see the iraq war as part of the anti-terrorism campaign .
the fact that the united states is could even question the usefulness and mission of nato is just another sign of how much times have changed .
three years after september 11 , 2001 , one thing is sure : " 9/11 " was an event of historic proportions , a seismic break , a turning point .
world politics have changed dramatically .
fifteen years after the end of the cold war , the world is threatened by another division , one which is partly brought on by the united states .
" whoever is n't for us , is against us : " the formula is as simple as it is risky .
look to guantánamo but how believable is u.s. policy , when on the one side the americans claim to be fighting for democracy and human rights , but continues to have ties to dictatorships ?
and how can the united states set an example for the world when it comes up short in pursuing the same goals that it is supposedly fighting for ?
-lrb- lest we forget guantánamo or abu ghraib . -rrb-
in the past three years of the " war on terror , " the world has not become a safer place .
on the contrary .
in afghanistan the taliban have once again been heard from in several provinces .
outside kabul , the warlords are back in power .
top-terrorist bin laden is still a free man .
his following around the world is growing - even in iraq .
and there , the situation is anything but stable , despite american hopes and promises .
the same can be said for the near east .
israelis and palestinians continue to fight , with no end in sight .
the americans know how important it would be for the islamic world to have a more-or-less fair peace in the near east .
but washington remains inactive , and nearly always protects israel .
another situation where american foreign policy has long ceased to be trustworthy .
of course , bush 's promise to democratize the islamic world was met by a great deal of mistrust in the first place .
then , the plan was made rubbish by u.s. foreign policy .
even if there had once been a modicum of hope , today only disappointment remains .
in diplomacy , words are deeds , but this rule need not hold true for politics .
in politics , words should be words - and these should be followed by deeds . miodrag soric -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

mr salmond lamented the current slow scottish growth , which stands at 1.7 % .
but he said with renewed confidence in the burgeoning hi-tech industries and small businesses the country could catch up with the 2.3 % figure .
he said the hi-tech sector , which employs 20,000 people , is the way to succeed on the world stage .
' world-class reputation ' the mp for banff and buchan said the scottish executive has failed to deliver economic strategies to pull scotland out of economic troubles , prompted by an ageing population and failing businesses .
he said : " given scotland 's world-class reputation of invention and ingenuity there is every reason to think that tomorrow 's hi-tech giant is currently operating out of a small office in inverness or pollokshields .
" the department of trade and industry 's latest state of the regions report showed scotland had the highest academic qualifications in the uk but we also had the lowest business survival rate .
" there can only be one of two reasons for this : either scotland is destined to under-perform or the government has n't created the right conditions for scotland to perform .
i believe it 's the latter . "
' poverty of ambition ' mr salmond added that too many people in power had a " poverty of ambition for scotland " and called for ministers to boost business confidence .
but for the hi-tech sector , as well as other critical sectors from finance to bio-sciences , to succeed he said scotland must be more competitive .
he said the government needs to keep investing in education and young people and develop a better tax structure to attract big companies to scotland and nurture start-ups .
mr salmond concluded competitiveness was not a dirty word and said : " some executive politicians find talk of competition either scary or distasteful , we need to change this mindset to make competition something to spur us on , not hide from . "

mr salmond lamented the current slow scottish growth , which stands at 1.7 % .

michael rhodes said he hoped the words penned by his 13-year-old daughter would help other victims of bullying .
laura rhodes , from neath , south wales , died a week ago taking a suspected overdose with her best friend .
rebecca ling , 14 , from longbridge , birmingham , survived and was released from hospital in swansea on wednesday .
a nationwide hunt was launched after the girls disappeared from neath train station when they had gone to see rebecca off home after she joined laura 's family holiday in crete .
the girls has just returned to south wales after being found in a b & b hotel in bath when rebecca revealed they had taken overdoses . "
if it can help other parents and other children it can only do good " michael rhodes south wales police , who are investigating the incident , said earlier this week that they did not believe bullying was a factor in the teenager 's death .

mr rhodes said he and his wife , yvonne , had been aware that their daughter had written an open letter about her experiences at the hands of bullies , and had this week come across it in her belongings .
' beyond words ' now they plan to hand out copies after laura 's funeral .
" it is sad and poignant .
i can not explain really , " said mr rhodes , 50 .
" you can not put it down until you finish it - it is beyond words sometimes .
" it can not help me , it can not help my wife , it is too late for laura .
" if it can help other parents and other children it can only do good .

" laura would only help people , there was not a nasty bone in her body , " he added .

in a statement earlier in the week , the family said laura had left cefn saeson comprehensive school after a year and attended the bryn-coch centre in neath , which is a pupil referral unit .
" laura left cefn saeson because she was terrified of the remarks and the taunts she endured every day , " her parents said .
they acknowledged that bullying was not the sole reason for what happened to laura but they said it was a factor .
peter rees , chairman of the governors at cefn saeson , had already said the school was conducting its own internal inquiry into the affair .
mr rees read a school statement which said : " to attempt to find a single reason for these events is premature and simplistic . "

the fight against tv licence fee evaders in mid wales is being taken off road .
inspectors are to use a land rover 4x4 to track down unlicensed properties in farms and cottages in remote locations .
the new scheme was piloted in scotland last month and proved such a success that wales is now being targeted .
however , the farmers ' union of wales said the crackdown could be seen as " overkill " .
the 4x4 will start by probing the brecon area later this month , but it will cover the entire mid wales region eventually .
handheld detectors will be used to hunt for those without a licence .
" visits to evaders in rural areas have always been part of our operations , " said michelle hughes , of tv licensing wales .
this might be seen as an overkill by officials as mid wales is n't the most populated of areas alan morris , farmers ' union of wales " however , we want evaders to know that we have new and effective ways to allow our officers to track down licence evaders in hard-to-reach , remote properties , even those properties with no road access .
" our database of over 28 million uk addresses tells us which rural properties are unlicensed , so our enquiry officers are targeting those rural properties in brecon and powys with the 4 x 4 .
" the clear message to all licence evaders - no matter where they live - is that they wo n't get away with it . "
mid wales has fewer people per acre than any other part of the country .
ms hughes added : " paying your licence is easy using direct debit or one of our other payment schemes , so there is no excuse for breaking the law .
people caught without a licence could face a trip to court and a fine of up to £ 1,000 , she said .
alan morris of the aberystwyth-based farmers ' union of wales said : " i think it 's unfair to suggest people in the countryside , such as farmers , try and evade the licence fee .
" farmers deal with regulations and rules everyday and are well aware of the penalties if they ignore them .
the majority of countryside people and farmers are law-abiding .

the fight against tv licence fee evaders in mid wales is being taken off road .
inspectors are to use a land rover 4x4 to track down unlicensed properties in farms and cottages in remote locations .
the new scheme was piloted in scotland last month and proved such a success that wales is now being targeted .
however , the farmers ' union of wales said the crackdown could be seen as " overkill " .
the 4x4 will start by probing the brecon area later this month , but it will cover the entire mid wales region eventually .
handheld detectors will be used to hunt for those without a licence .
" visits to evaders in rural areas have always been part of our operations , " said michelle hughes , of tv licensing wales .
this might be seen as an overkill by officials as mid wales is n't the most populated of areas alan morris , farmers ' union of wales " however , we want evaders to know that we have new and effective ways to allow our officers to track down licence evaders in hard-to-reach , remote properties , even those properties with no road access .
" our database of over 28 million uk addresses tells us which rural properties are unlicensed , so our enquiry officers are targeting those rural properties in brecon and powys with the 4 x 4 .
" the clear message to all licence evaders - no matter where they live - is that they wo n't get away with it . "
mid wales has fewer people per acre than any other part of the country .
ms hughes added : " paying your licence is easy using direct debit or one of our other payment schemes , so there is no excuse for breaking the law .
people caught without a licence could face a trip to court and a fine of up to £ 1,000 , she said .
alan morris of the aberystwyth-based farmers ' union of wales said : " i think it 's unfair to suggest people in the countryside , such as farmers , try and evade the licence fee .
" farmers deal with regulations and rules everyday and are well aware of the penalties if they ignore them .
the majority of countryside people and farmers are law-abiding .
" this might be seen as an overkill by officials as mid wales is n't the most populated of areas . "
