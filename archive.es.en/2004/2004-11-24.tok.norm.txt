part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .
-lrb- july 13 , 2004 -rrb- europe abolishes death penalty the european council has agreed that everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law .
no one shall be deprived of his life , regardless of circumstances .
-lrb- may 4 , 2002 -rrb- speaking out against the death penalty the un commission on human rights has called for the abolition of the death penalty .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .

" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .

in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .

they 're suing one publisher for millions . " will a millionaire kiss away silvia 's tears ? " or " victoria : why she 'll never have children " are just two of the many headlines that have rankled sweden 's bluebloods .
one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient .

about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .

" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .
he also said the events at coesfeld were unlikely to be an isolated incident .
" it 's just the tip of a not very hard to see iceberg , " he said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .

the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .

eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .

however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .

until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .

they weigh , on average , around 100 grams each but their weight in the festive market is much more than that .
in fact , they are in such demand year-in , year-out that an estimated 96.6 million of them are expected to be purchased before 2004 ’ s big day .
the invasion of the chocolate santa claus has begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they come in all sizes with the candy market one of the most fertile during the yuletide spell , the designers of chocolate santas have let their imaginations run wild in a bid to reach every corner of the sweet-toothed populace . a temptation for every persuasion from the enticing and sultry snow queen , targeted at the heterosexual male with hungry eyes and stomach to match , to the anatomically blessed saint nick for the ladies and the finely toned same-sex santa for those looking forward to a gay holiday , chocolate manufacturers are catering to everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa 's nemesis : the easter bunny despite the huge demands , santa still continues to lose out to his buck-toothed rival , the easter bunny , when it comes to the battle of the so-called hollow chocolate figures . of all the empty treats sold throughout the year , 56 percent of those are rabbit shaped .

many believe that chocolate santas which are not gobbled up by new year are remolded into the image of their fluffy-tailed nemesis ready for the shops in april . erbrath revealed that manufacturers only make as many as they believe can be sold and that santas that are still left on the shelf after the festivities are over are then sold off at cut-price and not turned into rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this one 's mine ! "
but with such exciting diversity in the range of santas available , it would be a surprise if any were left come the chiming of midnight on dec .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

they 're suing one publisher for millions . " will a millionaire kiss away silvia 's tears ? " or " victoria : why she 'll never have children " are just two of the many headlines that have rankled sweden 's bluebloods .
one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 barroso lays out aims for new commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso vowed that his commission would be " credible and strong " two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact . new european commission head jose manuel barroso reiterated on wednesday in an interview with portuguese daily newspaper publico that he opposes any major changes to euro zone deficit rules in the stability and growth pact , just days after taking up his position . barroso argued that the existing rules had greatly benefited the european economy , adding that the pact , which imposes a limit on public deficits of three percent of annual economic output , had contributed to the success of the euro currency and led to low interest rates . " people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .

" " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 ukraine crisis clouds eu-russia summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blue 's for yanukovich , orange for yushchenko a day before an eu-russia summit , the eu warned ukraine wednesday of " consequences " for its hopes of closer ties with europe if it fails to respond to concerns about contested elections . the warning came as european leaders scrambled to prevent an escalation of the row over the ex-soviet republic 's polls , which for many resemble a cold war-era standoff between east and west over influence in eastern europe . the row risks overshadowing an eu-russia summit planned thursday in the hague , with european leaders pledging to make their concerns about the ukrainian ballots crystal clear . amid fast-moving events in kiev , european commission chief jose barroso called on ukraine to delay announcement of final results until a full review of the polls had been undertaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso " there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said . yanukovich declared winner but ukraine 's central election commission announced late wednesday that pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich had won the vote .
yanukovich then offered immediate talks with his liberal challenger , saying he was ready to " look for common ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich with ballots from all polling stations counted , moscow-backed prime minister viktor yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- received 49.46 percent of the vote , compared to 46.61 percent for the west-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko , it said . following the annoucement , yushchenko called for a general strike across the country and refused to concede the election to yanukovich . ukraine 's outgoing president , leonid kuchma , said that civil war had become a real possibility because of the deep divisions in his country . ukraine has been one of the eu 's new neighbors since may , when the bloc took in 10 mostly ex-communist states in eastern europe .
eu leaders have long fostered strengthened ties with kiev , but have speeded up moves this year . the contested election risks sparking a serious downturn in those ties . solana calls for review eu foreign policy chief javier solana renewed a call for ukraine to look again at the contested poll result , which has sparked mass protests after the pro-russian prime minister claimed victory . referring to eastern ukraine where yanukovich has his stronghold , solana said : " in this part of ukraine , the vote has been fraudulently accounted , there is no doubt about that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and putin german chancellor gerhard schröder - who discussed the issue with russian president vladimir putin by phone - also weighed in , saying the ukrainian polls were marred by " massive fraud " and urging a peaceful end to the crisis . eu commission spokeswoman emma udwin recalled that eu foreign ministers on monday expressed serious concern about the presidential ballots and called for a review of procedures and the initial results . " we are urging our ukrainian partners to resist announcing the final result until that review has taken place , " she told reporters . envoys enroute meanwhile the eu 's dutch presidency confirmed it is to dispatch a special envoy to ukraine - former dutch ambassador to the united nations and nato niek biegman - in view of the tense situation there . at the same time polish president aleksander kwasniewski was sending one of his top advisors to ukraine , while anti-communist icon lech walesa also said he was ready to go . chilling moscow-brussels ties as well as straining eu ties with kiev , the crisis is also threatening to cool even further europe 's already-chilly relations with moscow , ukraine 's former soviet-era overlords . the issue is almost certain to overshadow a long-planned eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday . " it is our duty to say loudly and clearly that we are not satisfied with the way the elections occured in ukraine , " barroso said , adding that the eu would express its views " loudly , clearly and strongly " at the meeting . eu-russia relations have been chilly at best of late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 ukraine crisis clouds eu-russia summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blue 's for yanukovich , orange for yushchenko a day before an eu-russia summit , the eu warned ukraine wednesday of " consequences " for its hopes of closer ties with europe if it fails to respond to concerns about contested elections . the warning came as european leaders scrambled to prevent an escalation of the row over the ex-soviet republic 's polls , which for many resemble a cold war-era standoff between east and west over influence in eastern europe . the row risks overshadowing an eu-russia summit planned thursday in the hague , with european leaders pledging to make their concerns about the ukrainian ballots crystal clear . amid fast-moving events in kiev , european commission chief jose barroso called on ukraine to delay announcement of final results until a full review of the polls had been undertaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso " there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said . yanukovich declared winner but ukraine 's central election commission announced late wednesday that pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovich had won the vote .
yanukovich then offered immediate talks with his liberal challenger , saying he was ready to " look for common ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich with ballots from all polling stations counted , moscow-backed prime minister viktor yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- received 49.46 percent of the vote , compared to 46.61 percent for the west-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko , it said . following the annoucement , yushchenko called for a general strike across the country and refused to concede the election to yanukovich . ukraine 's outgoing president , leonid kuchma , said that civil war had become a real possibility because of the deep divisions in his country . ukraine has been one of the eu 's new neighbors since may , when the bloc took in 10 mostly ex-communist states in eastern europe .
eu leaders have long fostered strengthened ties with kiev , but have speeded up moves this year . the contested election risks sparking a serious downturn in those ties . solana calls for review eu foreign policy chief javier solana renewed a call for ukraine to look again at the contested poll result , which has sparked mass protests after the pro-russian prime minister claimed victory . referring to eastern ukraine where yanukovich has his stronghold , solana said : " in this part of ukraine , the vote has been fraudulently accounted , there is no doubt about that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and putin german chancellor gerhard schröder - who discussed the issue with russian president vladimir putin by phone - also weighed in , saying the ukrainian polls were marred by " massive fraud " and urging a peaceful end to the crisis . eu commission spokeswoman emma udwin recalled that eu foreign ministers on monday expressed serious concern about the presidential ballots and called for a review of procedures and the initial results . " we are urging our ukrainian partners to resist announcing the final result until that review has taken place , " she told reporters . envoys enroute meanwhile the eu 's dutch presidency confirmed it is to dispatch a special envoy to ukraine - former dutch ambassador to the united nations and nato niek biegman - in view of the tense situation there . at the same time polish president aleksander kwasniewski was sending one of his top advisors to ukraine , while anti-communist icon lech walesa also said he was ready to go . chilling moscow-brussels ties as well as straining eu ties with kiev , the crisis is also threatening to cool even further europe 's already-chilly relations with moscow , ukraine 's former soviet-era overlords . the issue is almost certain to overshadow a long-planned eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday . " it is our duty to say loudly and clearly that we are not satisfied with the way the elections occured in ukraine , " barroso said , adding that the eu would express its views " loudly , clearly and strongly " at the meeting . eu-russia relations have been chilly at best of late .

one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .

" they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .

" certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .

he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .

he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

they weigh , on average , around 100 grams each but their weight in the festive market is much more than that .
in fact , they are in such demand year-in , year-out that an estimated 96.6 million of them are expected to be purchased before 2004 ’ s big day .
the invasion of the chocolate santa claus has begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they come in all sizes with the candy market one of the most fertile during the yuletide spell , the designers of chocolate santas have let their imaginations run wild in a bid to reach every corner of the sweet-toothed populace . a temptation for every persuasion from the enticing and sultry snow queen , targeted at the heterosexual male with hungry eyes and stomach to match , to the anatomically blessed saint nick for the ladies and the finely toned same-sex santa for those looking forward to a gay holiday , chocolate manufacturers are catering to everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa 's nemesis : the easter bunny despite the huge demands , santa still continues to lose out to his buck-toothed rival , the easter bunny , when it comes to the battle of the so-called hollow chocolate figures . of all the empty treats sold throughout the year , 56 percent of those are rabbit shaped .
according to torben erbrath from the german sweet industry association , santas suffer from the fact that christmas offers a wider range of treats and presents while the bunny has only chocolate eggs for competition . no recycling into rabbits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa likes to fly as well erbrath moved quickly to quell persistent rumors that unsold santas meet an ironic fate .
many believe that chocolate santas which are not gobbled up by new year are remolded into the image of their fluffy-tailed nemesis ready for the shops in april . erbrath revealed that manufacturers only make as many as they believe can be sold and that santas that are still left on the shelf after the festivities are over are then sold off at cut-price and not turned into rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this one 's mine ! "
but with such exciting diversity in the range of santas available , it would be a surprise if any were left come the chiming of midnight on dec .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .

the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .
however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de weblog awards -pipe- 24.11.2004 go ahead and blog it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's best of the blogs tackles freedom of the press what happens when you put a scandalous chinese blogger , russia 's internet wonder child and germany 's blog authority at one table ?
a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

14 , 2004 -rrb- best of the blogs awards enter the final deutsche welle ’ s 2004 best of the blogs awards moves into the final round of its international weblog competition .

1 , 2004 -rrb- what 's a weblog ?
do n't even ask as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .

" " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .

it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration . muslim spiritual leaders should serve as " social bridge builders , " according to marieluise beck , who released her 20 action points in berlin on tuesday in the wake of the newly charged debate over the integration of germany 's 3.2 million muslims . beck did not agree with suggestions from some quarters , most prominently by the education minister in baden-württemberg , annette schavan , that imams should be required to preach in german at mosques .
but she did say it would be sensible if before their arrival in germany , foreign imams received training for work and life in the country , including language lessons and education in german cultural and legal norms . many imams who come to germany from abroad , mostly turkey , do not speak german and have little if any knowledge about the country or its mores . heated discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh beck 's strategy paper comes at a time when discussion over muslims ' place and integration into german society has heated up following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo von gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- on nov .
2 by a dutch-moroccan islamist in the netherlands and subsequent attacks on mosques and churches in the country .
over the past few weeks , many in germany have expressed fear that the violence could spread across the border . a rash of media reports depicting the formation of parallel societies in muslim enclaves and anti-german preaching being conducted in some mosques sparked both anger and concern over the desire of germany 's muslims to integrate and the willingness of germans to accept them . the strategy paper said that islamic extremism must be fought with all the powers that the german state has at its disposal , adding that the police and other law enforcement bodies should have the appropriate language and cultural skills .
beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .
many islam classes in public schools are currently offered only in turkish , since most of germany 's muslims are of turkish origin . no step backwards the integration commissioner warned against pushing relations between muslims and non-muslims in germany a step back through an integration discussion marked by accusations of intolerance and misunderstanding . " we run the danger of destroying the progress we 've already made in living side by side , " she said . a recent study by the think tank rwi showed that among the children and grandchildren of the first wave of muslim immigrants to germany , a sense of pessimism and feelings of exclusion are on the increase .
such developments are alarming , beck said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.11.2004 swedish royals sue german gossip rags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family is not amused tired of what they say are fabricated stories in the pages of german gossip magazines , the swedish royal family is hitting the rumormongers where it really hurts , the wallet .
they 're suing one publisher for millions . " will a millionaire kiss away silvia 's tears ? " or " victoria : why she 'll never have children " are just two of the many headlines that have rankled sweden 's bluebloods .
one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .
-lrb- july 13 , 2004 -rrb- europe abolishes death penalty the european council has agreed that everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law .
no one shall be deprived of his life , regardless of circumstances .
-lrb- may 4 , 2002 -rrb- speaking out against the death penalty the un commission on human rights has called for the abolition of the death penalty .
the resolution was put forth by the european union .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks .

however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .

until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order .

however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .
he also said the events at coesfeld were unlikely to be an isolated incident .
" it 's just the tip of a not very hard to see iceberg , " he said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .
-lrb- july 13 , 2004 -rrb- europe abolishes death penalty the european council has agreed that everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law .
no one shall be deprived of his life , regardless of circumstances .
-lrb- may 4 , 2002 -rrb- speaking out against the death penalty the un commission on human rights has called for the abolition of the death penalty .
the resolution was put forth by the european union .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .
however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .

" " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong .

" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.11.2004 judge criticizes telekom in first hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom could be left hanging for years waiting for a verdict german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday . a german court hit out at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , criticizing the methods used to value the group 's vast real estate portfolio in a landmark lawsuit that began in frankfurt on tuesday . during the first day of hearings , judge meinrad wösthoff rapped deutsche telekom 's over the knuckles for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land as a whole rather than individually as required by german law . shareholders are suing the company , claiming deutsche telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements in 1999 and 2000 . they said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . judge issues cautions the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom " did not correspond to the rules , " wösthoff stated .
but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.11.2004 torture or only mistreatment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one is talking at the freiherr vom stein base near coesfeld the german armed forces are reeling from allegations that several low-ranking officers mistreated bundeswehr recruits during basic training using methods possibly modelled on us torture in abu ghraib , iraq . the head of the german bundeswehr association , bernhard gertz , said on tuesday that five non-commissioned officers were being investigated by the state prosecutor 's office in münster for their actions this summer at an army base near the northwestern town of coesfeld . he said troops had been tortured with electrical shocks , had their noses held shut and water poured down their throats , citing members of the unit charged with the training the soldiers . " this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .
however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .
he also said the events at coesfeld were unlikely to be an isolated incident .
" it 's just the tip of a not very hard to see iceberg , " he said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .
-lrb- july 13 , 2004 -rrb- europe abolishes death penalty the european council has agreed that everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law .
no one shall be deprived of his life , regardless of circumstances .
-lrb- may 4 , 2002 -rrb- speaking out against the death penalty the un commission on human rights has called for the abolition of the death penalty .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .

" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 24.11.2004 which way , ukraine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands in kiev have been protesting alleged election fraud in the middle of the dispute over the ukrainian election result dw-world readers predict varying outcomes for the future of the country . in my opinion there should not need to be a choice for ukraine between eventual eu membership or maintaining a relationship with the russian federation , because both will sooner or later need to integrate as one . i believe that europe would be strengthened through political and military alliance between france , germany and the russia .
i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .

they weigh , on average , around 100 grams each but their weight in the festive market is much more than that .
in fact , they are in such demand year-in , year-out that an estimated 96.6 million of them are expected to be purchased before 2004 ’ s big day .
the invasion of the chocolate santa claus has begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they come in all sizes with the candy market one of the most fertile during the yuletide spell , the designers of chocolate santas have let their imaginations run wild in a bid to reach every corner of the sweet-toothed populace . a temptation for every persuasion from the enticing and sultry snow queen , targeted at the heterosexual male with hungry eyes and stomach to match , to the anatomically blessed saint nick for the ladies and the finely toned same-sex santa for those looking forward to a gay holiday , chocolate manufacturers are catering to everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa 's nemesis : the easter bunny despite the huge demands , santa still continues to lose out to his buck-toothed rival , the easter bunny , when it comes to the battle of the so-called hollow chocolate figures . of all the empty treats sold throughout the year , 56 percent of those are rabbit shaped .
according to torben erbrath from the german sweet industry association , santas suffer from the fact that christmas offers a wider range of treats and presents while the bunny has only chocolate eggs for competition . no recycling into rabbits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa likes to fly as well erbrath moved quickly to quell persistent rumors that unsold santas meet an ironic fate .
many believe that chocolate santas which are not gobbled up by new year are remolded into the image of their fluffy-tailed nemesis ready for the shops in april . erbrath revealed that manufacturers only make as many as they believe can be sold and that santas that are still left on the shelf after the festivities are over are then sold off at cut-price and not turned into rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this one 's mine ! "
but with such exciting diversity in the range of santas available , it would be a surprise if any were left come the chiming of midnight on dec .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .

the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.11.2004 judge criticizes telekom in first hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom could be left hanging for years waiting for a verdict german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday . a german court hit out at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , criticizing the methods used to value the group 's vast real estate portfolio in a landmark lawsuit that began in frankfurt on tuesday . during the first day of hearings , judge meinrad wösthoff rapped deutsche telekom 's over the knuckles for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land as a whole rather than individually as required by german law . shareholders are suing the company , claiming deutsche telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements in 1999 and 2000 . they said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . judge issues cautions the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom " did not correspond to the rules , " wösthoff stated .
but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks .

however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck said at the time in response . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyond the shock and disbelief surrounding the allegations of mistreatment , some are questioning why it took so long for the incident to come to light , especially since an estimated 80 conscripts were involved between june and september . helmuth prieß , a spokesman for a military watchdog group for soldiers , said there is systematic " threat and pressure " in the bundeswehr that keeps troops from speaking out after such mistreatment .
" there 's a system where soldiers just keep their heads down and usually keep their mouths shut , " prieß told the dpa news agency on tuesday .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

23 , 2004 -rrb- ukraine 's opposition leader takes oath ukraine 's opposition leader declared himself president tuesday as his supporters massed in front of parliament , deepening the political crisis in this divided nation after elections condemned by the west as fraudulent .
-lrb- nov .
23 , 2004 -rrb- ukrainians protest election fraud the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

they 're suing one publisher for millions . " will a millionaire kiss away silvia 's tears ? " or " victoria : why she 'll never have children " are just two of the many headlines that have rankled sweden 's bluebloods .
one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .
" we 're repentant sinners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paparazzi ruling could restrict german tabloids princess caroline of monaco won her case against german tabloids at the european court of human rights .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.11.2004 swedish royals sue german gossip rags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family is not amused tired of what they say are fabricated stories in the pages of german gossip magazines , the swedish royal family is hitting the rumormongers where it really hurts , the wallet .
they 're suing one publisher for millions . " will a millionaire kiss away silvia 's tears ? " or " victoria : why she 'll never have children " are just two of the many headlines that have rankled sweden 's bluebloods .
one too many stories about princess victoria wanting to marry a greek prince or queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf on the verge of getting a divorce have finally sent the scandinavian aristocracy to their attorney 's office . " certain german magazines , the so-called gossip press , have published very skewed stories , completely without basis , for quite some time , " court spokesman morgan gerle said . the swedish court says they 're fed up with allegedly false , slanderous stories and outrageous photo montages in several german magazines and they 've hired a hamburg attorney to do something about it . matthias prinz , a lawyer who specializes in media cases , has a good track record going to bat for wronged royals .
representing princess caroline of monaco , he won € 92,000 from germany 's premier gossip sheet , bunte , in 1996 and € 102,000 from another scandal sheet , gala , in 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king carl xvi gustaf and queen silvia last year sweden 's royal family won a legal battle over fabricated reports , and two german magazines were forced to publish apologies . but this time , sorry is n't enough .
the nordic nobility is pushing for full damages . cash only please although prinz wo n't reveal how much he 's asking for , rumor has it that it 's more than € 4 million -lrb- $ 5.3 million -rrb- .
the swedish press is reporting he is suing for 1,558 " lies " on 500 front pages of magazines published by the klambt group , based in southern germany . " they thought up these stories , now they have to face the legal consequences , " prinz told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . the klambt group publishes titles that focus on astrology , pets , hairstyles , recipes and puzzles .
among its magazines under fire for monarchical mudslinging are " women 's week , " " women 's world , " and " new woman , " all of which generally feature some celebrity in hardship - real or imagined - somewhere prominently in the issue . the trouble 's real this time although many of the high-profile travails in the magazine might be dreamt up , or at least " enhanced " in some fashion , the quandary facing the publishing group is most definitely not .
according to klambt executive rudiger dienst , a million-euro damage settlement could ruin the company . " three hundred employees will be out on the street if we have to pay up , " he told the swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet . he admits his magazines may not be as pure as the driven snow in this royal matter , but hopes a bit of mercy will be shown by the court .
" we 're repentant sinners , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paparazzi ruling could restrict german tabloids princess caroline of monaco won her case against german tabloids at the european court of human rights .

about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .

so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .

while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .

nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.11.2004 judge criticizes telekom in first hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom could be left hanging for years waiting for a verdict german telecoms giant deutsche telekom was reprimanded by the judge overseeing the massive lawsuit brought against the company by 15,000 angry shareholders in the first court hearing on tuesday . a german court hit out at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , criticizing the methods used to value the group 's vast real estate portfolio in a landmark lawsuit that began in frankfurt on tuesday . during the first day of hearings , judge meinrad wösthoff rapped deutsche telekom 's over the knuckles for valuing a huge portfolio of real estate comprising 35,000 buildings and plots of land as a whole rather than individually as required by german law . shareholders are suing the company , claiming deutsche telekom deliberately misled them about the valuation of its property portfolio in stock exchange prospectuses for two public share placements in 1999 and 2000 . they said the value of the properties was consistently overstated , inflating the book value of deutsche telekom itself , which in turn meant that investors paid a stiff premium for their shares . judge issues cautions the so-called " cluster " method of valuing property used by deutsche telekom " did not correspond to the rules , " wösthoff stated .
but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

" people sometimes have a short memory .

we ca n't change the character of the pact .

" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .

" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso .

it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration . muslim spiritual leaders should serve as " social bridge builders , " according to marieluise beck , who released her 20 action points in berlin on tuesday in the wake of the newly charged debate over the integration of germany 's 3.2 million muslims . beck did not agree with suggestions from some quarters , most prominently by the education minister in baden-württemberg , annette schavan , that imams should be required to preach in german at mosques .
but she did say it would be sensible if before their arrival in germany , foreign imams received training for work and life in the country , including language lessons and education in german cultural and legal norms . many imams who come to germany from abroad , mostly turkey , do not speak german and have little if any knowledge about the country or its mores . heated discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh beck 's strategy paper comes at a time when discussion over muslims ' place and integration into german society has heated up following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo von gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- on nov .
2 by a dutch-moroccan islamist in the netherlands and subsequent attacks on mosques and churches in the country .
over the past few weeks , many in germany have expressed fear that the violence could spread across the border . a rash of media reports depicting the formation of parallel societies in muslim enclaves and anti-german preaching being conducted in some mosques sparked both anger and concern over the desire of germany 's muslims to integrate and the willingness of germans to accept them . the strategy paper said that islamic extremism must be fought with all the powers that the german state has at its disposal , adding that the police and other law enforcement bodies should have the appropriate language and cultural skills .
beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .
many islam classes in public schools are currently offered only in turkish , since most of germany 's muslims are of turkish origin . no step backwards the integration commissioner warned against pushing relations between muslims and non-muslims in germany a step back through an integration discussion marked by accusations of intolerance and misunderstanding . " we run the danger of destroying the progress we 've already made in living side by side , " she said . a recent study by the think tank rwi showed that among the children and grandchildren of the first wave of muslim immigrants to germany , a sense of pessimism and feelings of exclusion are on the increase .
such developments are alarming , beck said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

they weigh , on average , around 100 grams each but their weight in the festive market is much more than that .
in fact , they are in such demand year-in , year-out that an estimated 96.6 million of them are expected to be purchased before 2004 ’ s big day .
the invasion of the chocolate santa claus has begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they come in all sizes with the candy market one of the most fertile during the yuletide spell , the designers of chocolate santas have let their imaginations run wild in a bid to reach every corner of the sweet-toothed populace . a temptation for every persuasion from the enticing and sultry snow queen , targeted at the heterosexual male with hungry eyes and stomach to match , to the anatomically blessed saint nick for the ladies and the finely toned same-sex santa for those looking forward to a gay holiday , chocolate manufacturers are catering to everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa 's nemesis : the easter bunny despite the huge demands , santa still continues to lose out to his buck-toothed rival , the easter bunny , when it comes to the battle of the so-called hollow chocolate figures . of all the empty treats sold throughout the year , 56 percent of those are rabbit shaped .
according to torben erbrath from the german sweet industry association , santas suffer from the fact that christmas offers a wider range of treats and presents while the bunny has only chocolate eggs for competition . no recycling into rabbits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa likes to fly as well erbrath moved quickly to quell persistent rumors that unsold santas meet an ironic fate .
many believe that chocolate santas which are not gobbled up by new year are remolded into the image of their fluffy-tailed nemesis ready for the shops in april . erbrath revealed that manufacturers only make as many as they believe can be sold and that santas that are still left on the shelf after the festivities are over are then sold off at cut-price and not turned into rabbits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this one 's mine ! "
but with such exciting diversity in the range of santas available , it would be a surprise if any were left come the chiming of midnight on dec .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .
finally there is a form of communication that is direct , self-referencing and seldom easy to explain .
so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only russia 's rich and educated have internet access , nossik said for those with internet access , blogs can help change and direct public opinion , said nossik , a medical student turned media manager , who has been involved in nearly all russia 's influential internet projects .
while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .
as the authorities in russia increase their control over television and radio , weblogs have remained unchallenged and are one of the only ways to spread dissenting opinions .
eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .
" when it fulfils this function , then it is a good blog - exactly the same as a good magazine . "
blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .
a growing movement while the bloggers agreed their weblogs are n't likely to change the world , they are " part of a growing movement , " kantel concluded before ducking behind his monitor , adding another blog entry with the hope of making sure the movement continues to grow . markus bösch -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what the us could learn about blogging bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in .

the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .

“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks .

until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .
however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .

a discussion of whether blogs can change the world - and about two dozen live posts . in front of a backdrop of old-fashioned books in what could pass as a living room , bloggers are bent over electronic devices in cologne 's cafe largus .
as quickly as they can type into weblogs , their words are appearing to readers around the world .

so what exactly are these weblogs ?
a long way from purple mimeographs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobs jury member jörg kantel passes along information via his weblog " the interesting thing about blogs , is that they cover everything : diaries , travel reports or a daily grazing of technically interesting and politically interesting links , like mine , " explained jörg kantel -lrb- photo -rrb- , computing director of the max-planck institute in berlin .
in the german weblog scene , kantel is well-known for his blog schockwellenreiter , which he has published in its current form since april 2000 .
a long-time organizer of grass-roots journalism efforts , blogs are helping kantel reach a broader audience than the flyers he used to photocopy .
" this is the first opportunity i have had that enables me , without much in the way of finance , to reach a potentially huge public audience , " he said , punching text into his apple notebook .
while the internet provides people access to information , bloggers will have to overcome a number of difficulties if they want to have a bigger impact on public discourse .
the russian elite " blogs allow everyone to become his own producer , editor-in-chief or prophet , " said russian internet expert anton nossik -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" this does of course mean that weblogs can turn out to be somewhat narrow .
it is always essential to see how many people also read blogs . "

while the russian internet has boomed for five years and is home to a potentially huge audience , only a minority of people have access to the world wide web .
nossik estimated that about 13 percent of the russians have internet access .
" in russia it is the elites , the best educated and the richest who have access to the truth , " nossik explained .

eroticism , philosophy and the beckhams chinese blogger li li , known by her nom de plum mu zimei , can hardly complain about a shortage of attention .
there were millions of people clabbering to read her erotic diary until the chinese government shut down the 26-year-old publicist and philosophy student 's site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mu zimei 's erotic blog was banned in china " a blog should be amusing , " said li li -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is enjoying her first trip outside of china .

blogs can also be a way into internationalize the exchange of information , li li said , admitting to having a penchant for frequent visits to a blog with up-to-date information about soccer star david beckham 's dogs .
kantel , nossik and li li are all jury members for the deutsche welle 's 2004 international weblog awards , which aims to honor the best weblogs from around the world in 11 categories and seven languages .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .
now , the pensioners and small-time savers who believed their hard-earned savings would be safe in europe 's biggest phone company want their money back . and the roughly 15,000 investors have instructed 750 lawyers to file 2,200 separate lawsuits for a total of around € 100 million euros -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- in compensation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of deutsche telekom , ron sommer .
the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 eu pushes for abolition of death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convicted criminals in vietnam still face possible execution the eu begins hosting a three-day seminar on the death penalty in vietnam on wednesday .
part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .
-lrb- july 13 , 2004 -rrb- europe abolishes death penalty the european council has agreed that everyone ’ s right to life shall be protected by law .
no one shall be deprived of his life , regardless of circumstances .
-lrb- may 4 , 2002 -rrb- speaking out against the death penalty the un commission on human rights has called for the abolition of the death penalty .

part of the eu 's effort to abolish the death penalty around the world , the event may signal that its efforts are paying off . on wednesday , experts and government officials from vietnam and four other countries will gather in hanoi for the eu-hosted seminar , where they 'll discuss vietnam 's continued use of the death penalty . surprisingly , the seminar is taking place at the prompting of the - until recently - staunchly pro-death penalty vietnamese government .
some experts are taking it as a sign that eu efforts to abolish the death penalty around the world may be starting to bear fruit . while more than 118 countries have abolished the death penalty either in law or practice , 78 remain committed to the policy , including the united states , a country with whom the eu currently has strained relations .
in moving its anti-death penalty campaign forward , the eu faces significant challenges . vietnamese offer to debate issue in the past , european efforts to raise the issue of the death penalty with vietnamese officials had very little effect .
but at a recent meeting , the vietnamese side expressed an interest in taking an in-depth look at their policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of different social organizations protest death penalty near the gate of alipore central jail in calcutta , india , saturday , aug .
14 , 2004 .
the agenda of this week 's meeting will cover relevant instruments of international law , including the united nation 's international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- and its second optional protocol on the death penalty .
in addition , european abolition experiences , vietnamese practice and application , alternative punishments , and transitional strategies will be discussed , chistoph wiesner , head of the political , commercial and economic section of the eu delegation of the european commission to vietnam , told dw-world . however , he is not optimistic that the seminar will prompt immediate change . “ we do not expect it to have any immediate impact on the realties in vietnam , ” he said .
“ we hope , however , that it will contribute to ongoing reflections about a possible reduction of the death penalty 's scope of application as a first step towards eventual overall abolition . ” eu takes on the death penalty since the late 1990 's , the eu has taken an increasingly active role in pushing for the abolition of the death penalty around the world . in 1997 , the same year the un commission on human rights passed a resolution calling on all countries to abolish the death penalty , the eu heads of government called for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
in 1998 , the eu drew up policy guidelines , promising to “ where relevant , raise the issue of the death penalty in its dialogue with third countries . ” the eu has since used a variety of means to push the 78 remaining holdouts , including the us , to reconsider their stance on capital punishment .
eu member states have agreed to make the abolition of the death penalty mandatory for all acceding states , and regularly issue demarches in cases where the application of the death penalty violates the eu 's minimum standards , as in the case of a nigerian woman who was sentenced to death by stoning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lethal injection table inside execution chamber , us federal penitentiary , terre haute , indiana in the us , the eu adopted a unique strategy .
since 2001 , it has submitted “ amicus curiae ” -lrb- “ friends of the court ” -rrb- briefs to the us supreme court in cases involving the death penalty .
in a 2002 case involving a mentally retarded person who was appealing a death sentence , the court ruled in favor of the defendant and referred to the eu brief in its decision . room for improvement those involved with non-profit efforts to abolish the death penalty say the eu has made a valuable contribution to the fight . “ it 's first and main contribution was to put the death penalty 's abolition into the second article of the european charter on human rights , ” michel taube , executive director of the world coalition against the death penalty , said .
“ the decision to definitively abolish the death penalty in europe was a big political and legal victory . ” nonetheless , taube said there is room for improvement .
for one , he would like to see the eu place more emphasis on urging countries to sign-up to internationally binding agreements , such as the iccpr , which he said , is the only truly effective way to end the use of the death penalty . what 's more , according to taube , the eu has focused too strongly on the death penalty as a purely human rights issue .
in his opinion , the eu needs to make a better case for the abolition of the death penalty in the context of a more effective approach to crime prevention . “ the eu is not making a strong enough case that you can fight crime without the death penalty , ” he said . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges iraq not to reinstate death penalty in brussels monday , eu foreign ministers called on iraq 's foreign minister not to reintroduce capital punishment , which was suspended after the toppling of saddam hussein .

" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
gertz and other armed forces officials consider the problem to be of an isolated nature . prosecutors said that as many as 21 soldiers , mostly non-commissioned officers of sergeant rank , and at least one captain were involved in the episode .
the german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in this week 's edition that the sergeants would pretend to be arab terrorists that took the recruits as hostages in order to submit them to physical and psychological mistreatment . according to a report in the bild newspaper , a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer has admitted to mistreating recruits with electric shocks . " he very much regrets what he did , " the soldier 's lawyer told the paper . bildunterschrift : inspired by iraq ? the first incident reportedly took place in june , at the same time that shocking pictures of torture of iraqi prisoners by us soldiers went around the world .
whether the soldiers responsible for the mistreatment were inspired by the events at the abu ghraib prison is uncertain .
however , they did allegedly use similar methods , including hooding their victims , stripping them and photographing them . german defense minister peter struck confirmed earlier this week that an investigation was underway .
however , he refused use the word " torture " in conjunction with the affair . " it is absolutely plain that the trainers responsible seriously overstepped their role .
this can not be tolerated and we have taken steps against it , " he said .
" all those responsible will be brought to account . " struck will face questions from the parliamentary defense committee on wednesday .
until then , the defense ministry is refusing to comment on the matter . defending torture the latest scandal comes only months after struck was embarrassed by an instructor at an officer training school who had defended torture as a legitimate instrument in the war on terror .
military historian michael wolffsohn said in may that although he did not condone the treatment at the abu ghraib prison , " torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order .

but he immediately cautioned that that did not automatically mean that the valuations themselves were wrong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amount of documentation in the case implies a lengthy lawsuit the deutsche telekom court case is legally and logistically without precedent in germany .
about 15,000 small shareholders are suing the mighty telecoms giant because they feel they paid too much for shares bought when the former state-owned monopoly was privatized in the 1990s . it was only when deutsche telekom was forced to write down the value of its real estate holdings at the beginning of 2001 that shareholders became aware of the problem . and investors very quickly saw their savings go up in smoke as the news sent what once dubbed the " people 's share " into a long and precipitous slide on the stock market .

the plaintiffs are suing everyone involved in the privatization of deutsche telekom - the company itself and its former chief ron sommer , the government , the state-owned privatization vehicle kfw bank , and even the underwriting banks , such as deutsche bank . investors also feel cheated that they were not fully informed about the risks connected with deutsche telekom 's planned acquisition of us mobile phone operator voicestream barely a month after the third share offering in july 2000 . share price plummeted after voicestream deal deutsche telekom paid more than $ 40 billion for voicestream , a price seen as too high by many analysts , and another key factor behind the dizzying fall in the price of the german group 's shares .
they lost almost 92 percent of their value , plunging from the giddy heights of a record € 103.90 at the height of the internet boom to an all-time low of € 8.59 on june 26 , 2002 . judge wösthoff said those complaints were not justified and added that former ceo sommer could not be held responsible for the slide in the share price . case could possibly take years because it is not possible to file class-action suits in germany , the court must decide on each case individually .
to make his task easier , wösthoff is hear to just 10 cases which will then serve as a basis for his rulings for the rest . the next hearing was convened for june 21 , 2005 , giving both plaintiffs and defendants time to prepare their cases in such a complex matter , the judge said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

destatis estimated that private households would face around € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in additional fuel costs this year as a result of the runaway price of oil .
that is much less than the € 9-billion increase in fuel costs seen in 1999/2000 when oil prices also surged strongly .

by contrast , in the first nine months of the current year , crude oil prices rose by 44 percent in dollar terms , but only by 33 percent in euro terms , destatis said .

destatis estimated that private households would face around € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- in additional fuel costs this year as a result of the runaway price of oil .
that is much less than the € 9-billion increase in fuel costs seen in 1999/2000 when oil prices also surged strongly .
at that time , crude oil prices rose by just under 60 percent on a dollar basis , but soared by 80 percent when calculated in euros , because of the then-weakness of single currency in 1999/2000 .
by contrast , in the first nine months of the current year , crude oil prices rose by 44 percent in dollar terms , but only by 33 percent in euro terms , destatis said .
furthermore , the fuel bill for private households has been further shortened by the fact that consumers have throttled fuel consumption and also sought cheaper and more efficient sources of energy , the office found .

i think this is needed as a counter-veiling power to the alliance of the us and great britain . - gustavo araujo , south america the sanctions must be imposed as soon as possible to ensure the irreversibility of the " rosy revolution " that is currently taking place in ukraine .
we must maintain sufficient pressure on the authorities in order to ensure the eventual president is elected by the democratic majority . - vlad grynovetskyy , ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is obvious that the election results have been fabricated and that international observers have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the elections , i believe that the international community has a role to play in ensuring that the popular majority candidate succeeds .
i am also of the opinion that russia should not become involved in ukrainian elections .
by openly supporting the incumbent candidate yanukovich , vladimir putin is playing an unwanted and undemocratic role in skewing the election results .
the way forward , i believe , would be to annul the results of the current elections and hold another round of freer and fairer elections .
a mere recount of the votes would not , for example , take care of such violations as the duplication of absentee ballots or a possible fabrication of results by the election committees in the ukrainian provinces . - natalia bruslanova , new york viktor yushchenko 's victory is a vital precondition to a successful transition of ukraine to a true democratic society after only 14 years of relative independence .
yanukovich would lead the country back into the arms of russia with its dreams of rebuilding the old empire , enhancing ukraine 's economic and political exploitation by russian interests .
strengthening ukraine 's independence is of vital long term interest to poland , germany and other members of the eu . - m smyk i believe that for europe , a yushchenko victory is a vote for democracy and , i hope , the beginning of ukraine 's path to becoming a truly independent state away from the control that russia continues to exert on the country . it will hopefully deepen its reforms and improve its legal system , which will allow the successful elimination of many of the ' gangsters ' who continue to profit from the collapse of the former soviet union . - george olynyk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine locked in election standoff a tense standoff has gripped ukraine after its pro-russia prime minister won the presidential election and the opposition mounted massive protests to contest results of a vote that washington and europe said was rigged .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .
" so unless the parliament 's legal service comes up with some astonishing news , then the case is closed , " added the former danish prime minister . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission stumbles at first hurdle after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .

but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .
" so unless the parliament 's legal service comes up with some astonishing news , then the case is closed , " added the former danish prime minister . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission stumbles at first hurdle after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .

it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration . muslim spiritual leaders should serve as " social bridge builders , " according to marieluise beck , who released her 20 action points in berlin on tuesday in the wake of the newly charged debate over the integration of germany 's 3.2 million muslims . beck did not agree with suggestions from some quarters , most prominently by the education minister in baden-württemberg , annette schavan , that imams should be required to preach in german at mosques .
but she did say it would be sensible if before their arrival in germany , foreign imams received training for work and life in the country , including language lessons and education in german cultural and legal norms . many imams who come to germany from abroad , mostly turkey , do not speak german and have little if any knowledge about the country or its mores . heated discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh beck 's strategy paper comes at a time when discussion over muslims ' place and integration into german society has heated up following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo von gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- on nov .
2 by a dutch-moroccan islamist in the netherlands and subsequent attacks on mosques and churches in the country .
over the past few weeks , many in germany have expressed fear that the violence could spread across the border . a rash of media reports depicting the formation of parallel societies in muslim enclaves and anti-german preaching being conducted in some mosques sparked both anger and concern over the desire of germany 's muslims to integrate and the willingness of germans to accept them . the strategy paper said that islamic extremism must be fought with all the powers that the german state has at its disposal , adding that the police and other law enforcement bodies should have the appropriate language and cultural skills .
beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .
many islam classes in public schools are currently offered only in turkish , since most of germany 's muslims are of turkish origin . no step backwards the integration commissioner warned against pushing relations between muslims and non-muslims in germany a step back through an integration discussion marked by accusations of intolerance and misunderstanding . " we run the danger of destroying the progress we 've already made in living side by side , " she said . a recent study by the think tank rwi showed that among the children and grandchildren of the first wave of muslim immigrants to germany , a sense of pessimism and feelings of exclusion are on the increase .
such developments are alarming , beck said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .
we must force you to end the prevailing crisis and bring the country back on the track of economic growth , " merz -lrb- photo -rrb- said on wednesday . merz 's assertion that the 2005 budget is unconstitutional because new borrowing would exceed government investments was dismissed by anja haiduk , budget spokeswomen for the greens , junior partner in the government coalition . germany to again breach eu rules " next year ’ s budget will be constitutional , despite difficult economic times marked by a long period of stagnation , " haiduk said .
" i ’ m convinced the german president will sign it into law after it passes through parliament .
what concerns me is the eu stability pact .
we are eager to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent , but everything will depend on how the economy develops next year . " eichel is reckoning with a 2.9 percent budget deficit next year , after germany breached the eu 's 3 percent limit in 2002 , 2003 , and looks set to do so again this year .
but economic analysts are skeptical , saying germany can only reach that goal if brussels were to change its deficit calculations .
germany - europe 's biggest paymaster - has long been demanding that its net payments to brussels be taken into consideration when making deficit calculations , as should domestic investment in science and research . uwe hessler -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .

among the areas singled out for transferring power are the protection of personal data , free movement and settlement , diplomatic protection , the movement of capital and the freezing of funds , as well as new competencies for the court of justice allowing it to rule on industrial property rights , space and health policies .
the so-called flexibility clause , which allows the extension of union powers without new ratification by national parliaments or referenda , is also seen as a transfer of power .
in countries such as france and spain it is being discussed whether the primacy of union laws over national law - the principle has been written for the first time into a treaty - is compatible with national constitutions .
the danish legal experts , however , point out that the court of justice introduced the principle in 1964 before denmark even joined the eu .
general access for the council to move new areas to qualified majority votes is not regarded as a loss of sovereignty by the danish ministry of justice as it points out that this principle was accepted with the nice treaty in 2001 .
the danish government has already pledged to submit the constitution to a referendum - but no date has been set .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 barroso lays out aims for new commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso vowed that his commission would be " credible and strong " two days after the new european commission finally started work , new chief jose manuel barroso laid out his plans for a solid and independent commission and made clear his views on the stability and growth pact . new european commission head jose manuel barroso reiterated on wednesday in an interview with portuguese daily newspaper publico that he opposes any major changes to euro zone deficit rules in the stability and growth pact , just days after taking up his position . barroso argued that the existing rules had greatly benefited the european economy , adding that the pact , which imposes a limit on public deficits of three percent of annual economic output , had contributed to the success of the euro currency and led to low interest rates . " people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .
" so unless the parliament 's legal service comes up with some astonishing news , then the case is closed , " added the former danish prime minister . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission stumbles at first hurdle after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .
now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal .
-lrb- november 23 , 2004 -rrb- new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

head of the european socialists poul nyrup rasmussen on tuesday said , " we could go to the us and see how they do it there , " said the danish mep .
the us congress can block an individual cabinet nominee put forward by a president – the european parliament , by contrast , can only approve or reject the whole team of commissioners .
barrot ’ s past only came to light when uk eurosceptic mep nigel farage last week revealed it minutes before the european parliament voted the whole team into office .
and this was despite the fact that barrot had been heard twice by meps - once when he first came to office in april and then again in october when he was reconfirmed as france 's commissioner .
rasmussen conceded that a substantial change to the current system so that meps could reject one commissioner are a long way off .
this would imply a treaty change , and therefore agreement by governments .
" let ’ s get the constitution treaty accepted first , " said rasmussen .

it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration . muslim spiritual leaders should serve as " social bridge builders , " according to marieluise beck , who released her 20 action points in berlin on tuesday in the wake of the newly charged debate over the integration of germany 's 3.2 million muslims . beck did not agree with suggestions from some quarters , most prominently by the education minister in baden-württemberg , annette schavan , that imams should be required to preach in german at mosques .
but she did say it would be sensible if before their arrival in germany , foreign imams received training for work and life in the country , including language lessons and education in german cultural and legal norms . many imams who come to germany from abroad , mostly turkey , do not speak german and have little if any knowledge about the country or its mores . heated discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh beck 's strategy paper comes at a time when discussion over muslims ' place and integration into german society has heated up following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo von gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- on nov .
2 by a dutch-moroccan islamist in the netherlands and subsequent attacks on mosques and churches in the country .
over the past few weeks , many in germany have expressed fear that the violence could spread across the border . a rash of media reports depicting the formation of parallel societies in muslim enclaves and anti-german preaching being conducted in some mosques sparked both anger and concern over the desire of germany 's muslims to integrate and the willingness of germans to accept them . the strategy paper said that islamic extremism must be fought with all the powers that the german state has at its disposal , adding that the police and other law enforcement bodies should have the appropriate language and cultural skills .
beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .
many islam classes in public schools are currently offered only in turkish , since most of germany 's muslims are of turkish origin . no step backwards the integration commissioner warned against pushing relations between muslims and non-muslims in germany a step back through an integration discussion marked by accusations of intolerance and misunderstanding . " we run the danger of destroying the progress we 've already made in living side by side , " she said . a recent study by the think tank rwi showed that among the children and grandchildren of the first wave of muslim immigrants to germany , a sense of pessimism and feelings of exclusion are on the increase .
such developments are alarming , beck said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

21 , 2004 -rrb- integration debate heats up in germany leading german politicians have said muslims will have to integrate themselves better if they wish to remain in the country .
this coincides with conservatives ' calls to emphasize patriotism and christian values .

yanukovich then offered immediate talks with his liberal challenger , saying he was ready to " look for common ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich with ballots from all polling stations counted , moscow-backed prime minister viktor yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- received 49.46 percent of the vote , compared to 46.61 percent for the west-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko , it said . following the annoucement , yushchenko called for a general strike across the country and refused to concede the election to yanukovich . ukraine 's outgoing president , leonid kuchma , said that civil war had become a real possibility because of the deep divisions in his country . ukraine has been one of the eu 's new neighbors since may , when the bloc took in 10 mostly ex-communist states in eastern europe .
eu leaders have long fostered strengthened ties with kiev , but have speeded up moves this year . the contested election risks sparking a serious downturn in those ties . solana calls for review eu foreign policy chief javier solana renewed a call for ukraine to look again at the contested poll result , which has sparked mass protests after the pro-russian prime minister claimed victory . referring to eastern ukraine where yanukovich has his stronghold , solana said : " in this part of ukraine , the vote has been fraudulently accounted , there is no doubt about that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and putin german chancellor gerhard schröder - who discussed the issue with russian president vladimir putin by phone - also weighed in , saying the ukrainian polls were marred by " massive fraud " and urging a peaceful end to the crisis . eu commission spokeswoman emma udwin recalled that eu foreign ministers on monday expressed serious concern about the presidential ballots and called for a review of procedures and the initial results . " we are urging our ukrainian partners to resist announcing the final result until that review has taken place , " she told reporters . envoys enroute meanwhile the eu 's dutch presidency confirmed it is to dispatch a special envoy to ukraine - former dutch ambassador to the united nations and nato niek biegman - in view of the tense situation there . at the same time polish president aleksander kwasniewski was sending one of his top advisors to ukraine , while anti-communist icon lech walesa also said he was ready to go . chilling moscow-brussels ties as well as straining eu ties with kiev , the crisis is also threatening to cool even further europe 's already-chilly relations with moscow , ukraine 's former soviet-era overlords . the issue is almost certain to overshadow a long-planned eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday . " it is our duty to say loudly and clearly that we are not satisfied with the way the elections occured in ukraine , " barroso said , adding that the eu would express its views " loudly , clearly and strongly " at the meeting . eu-russia relations have been chilly at best of late .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .
" so unless the parliament 's legal service comes up with some astonishing news , then the case is closed , " added the former danish prime minister . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission stumbles at first hurdle after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .
now , just days later , one of its members is at the centre of a whole new scandal .
-lrb- november 23 , 2004 -rrb- new commissioner faces first test just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic .

" " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong .

barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc european parliament could learn from us meps have been stung by the fact that their hearings , which they billed as tough in-depth examinations of commissioners , failed to turn up something as serious as a prior conviction for illegal party funding - as was the case for french commissioner jacques barrot .
head of the european socialists poul nyrup rasmussen on tuesday said , " we could go to the us and see how they do it there , " said the danish mep .
the us congress can block an individual cabinet nominee put forward by a president – the european parliament , by contrast , can only approve or reject the whole team of commissioners .
barrot ’ s past only came to light when uk eurosceptic mep nigel farage last week revealed it minutes before the european parliament voted the whole team into office .
and this was despite the fact that barrot had been heard twice by meps - once when he first came to office in april and then again in october when he was reconfirmed as france 's commissioner .
rasmussen conceded that a substantial change to the current system so that meps could reject one commissioner are a long way off .
this would imply a treaty change , and therefore agreement by governments .
" let ’ s get the constitution treaty accepted first , " said rasmussen .

the spending plan also foresees fresh public borrowing to the tune of € 22 billion , and a record € 17 billion euros in revenues from the privatization of government property . after years of economic decline in germany , finance minister hans eichel is banking on the start of an economic upswing .
he predicts the economy will grow by 1.7 percent next year , pouring € 190 billion of tax money into empty state coffers .
eichel said the proposed budget is the best possible , given the background of a weak economy and attempts by the opposition to block a substantial cut in state subsidies . " our efforts regarding expenditures are exhausted .
what ’ s missing is a clear effort on the part of the conservative majority in the second chamber of parliament to help reduce tax breaks and subsidies .
in addition , economic growth in the past was not as strong as we expected it to be , " eichel said during the budget debate . eichel claimed that the cdu-led majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has blocked € 17 billion in government cutbacks .
he said that is why he now has to resort to huge privatizations in order to balance the budget . privatization plans criticized the conservative opposition derided the budget as being far too optimistic .
opposition members said eichel ’ s growth figures are unrealistic , in light of economists ' predictions of only 1.4 percent economic growth next year .
the cdu ’ s finance expert , friedrich merz , in particular criticized eichel 's plan to raise new debts while selling off the last valuable bits of government property . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu financial expert friedrich merz " we can no longer tolerate your irresponsible attitude towards future generations , and will therefore lodge a complaint about the budget with the constitutional court .

" people sometimes have a short memory .
they forget what the successes of the stability and growth pact are .
we ca n't change the character of the pact .
we ca n't touch its main rules , " he said .
" it would be very bad for the european economy . " barroso firm on pact rules and economics in response to calls from germany and france for a revision of national deficit calculations to exclude certain payments into the eu coffers , barroso said , " if people think that by increasing expenses more growth is created , they are fooling themselves , " he said , adding low interest rates were the best way to bring about growth . “ there are two contradictory pressures on the commission : there are those who want to make so many changes that it would represent the end of the pact , there are others who do n't want to change anything , they are fundamentalists of orthodoxy , " he added .
" both positions are not realistic . " strong and independent executive his views follow a statement of intent for his new commission in which he vowed on tuesday that his new eu executive would be strong and independent , as he reiterated his " full support " for an embattled commissioner . in his first speech since taking office on monday under a cloud centered on his french eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , he also lamented attacks on his commission which he said had become almost " fashionable . " " in a europe of 25 -lrb- states -rrb- , the role of the commission and the community method are more important than ever , " he told the college of europe in bruges - where generations of eurocrats have been trained - adding that the eu executive arm must be " independent , credible and strong . " barroso added that he was all for close cooperation with the other eu institutions , including the european parliament .
but he also said that europe needs " politicians with a genuine vocation for europe , able to take on extremism and populism , " and also able to avoid joining " attacks against the commission because it is more or less fashionable . " barrot row clouds barroso 's first day the row over barrot clouded barroso 's first day in office on monday , which had already been delayed by three weeks after eu lawmakers objected to his first-choice line-up for the eu executive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques barrot .
barrot has been called on to resign by some eu lawmakers after it emerged that he was convicted , but then pardoned in the late 1990s over the financing of his social democratic center party . but pressure appears to have eased , notably after socialists in the european parliament said they would abide by a legal decision on whether barrot should be barred from office because of the amnestied conviction . in a newspaper interview barroso said he remained fully behind the french commissioner .
" i support all my commissioners 100 percent , " barroso told the belgian daily la libre belgique .
" mr. barrot has my full support .
he will be an excellent commissioner , " he added . the french commissioner released a letter to european parliament president josep borrell on monday in which he strongly denied any attempt to deceive either members of the european parliament or barroso by keeping quiet .
the letter explained that the conviction had been quashed under a wide-ranging amnesty granted by french president jacques chirac , so there was no need to disclose it . calls still echo for resignation while pressure from eu lawmakers has eased , another call for barrot to quit emerged tuesday in the form of an editorial from the financial times , which said the french commissioner should go for failing to mention the amnestied conviction to barroso . " mr. barrot 's failure to mention the episode either to mr. barroso or to the european parliament has shown an inability to appreciate the need for commissioners to be totally candid if they are to earn the trust of an increasingly skeptical european public , " said the influential newspaper . problem resolved , say commission figures barroso , who has admitted that he had been in the dark over the conviction , reiterated in the newspaper interview tuesday that the " problem ... has already been resolved , " and added : “ the arguments which mr. barrot has presented to me are sufficient . " eu parliament sources also indicated that the standoff is effectively resolved .
" in terms of the substance , the drama is over in the parliament , " said poul nyrup rasmussen , president of the party of european socialists .
" so unless the parliament 's legal service comes up with some astonishing news , then the case is closed , " added the former danish prime minister . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission stumbles at first hurdle after a difficult start , jose barroso 's new eu commission was finally given the green light to start work last week .

it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration . muslim spiritual leaders should serve as " social bridge builders , " according to marieluise beck , who released her 20 action points in berlin on tuesday in the wake of the newly charged debate over the integration of germany 's 3.2 million muslims . beck did not agree with suggestions from some quarters , most prominently by the education minister in baden-württemberg , annette schavan , that imams should be required to preach in german at mosques .
but she did say it would be sensible if before their arrival in germany , foreign imams received training for work and life in the country , including language lessons and education in german cultural and legal norms . many imams who come to germany from abroad , mostly turkey , do not speak german and have little if any knowledge about the country or its mores . heated discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh beck 's strategy paper comes at a time when discussion over muslims ' place and integration into german society has heated up following the killing of dutch filmmaker theo von gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- on nov .

over the past few weeks , many in germany have expressed fear that the violence could spread across the border . a rash of media reports depicting the formation of parallel societies in muslim enclaves and anti-german preaching being conducted in some mosques sparked both anger and concern over the desire of germany 's muslims to integrate and the willingness of germans to accept them . the strategy paper said that islamic extremism must be fought with all the powers that the german state has at its disposal , adding that the police and other law enforcement bodies should have the appropriate language and cultural skills .
beck said the distribution of fundamentalist materials , such as printed or spoken word material , in the areas around mosques should be stopped , adding that mosque associations also had responsibilities in this area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the ahmadiyya muslim community in berlin during islam instruction islamic religious education in german should be offered on a voluntary basis by schools , beck suggested .

" we run the danger of destroying the progress we 've already made in living side by side , " she said . a recent study by the think tank rwi showed that among the children and grandchildren of the first wave of muslim immigrants to germany , a sense of pessimism and feelings of exclusion are on the increase .

the four men were named as sogir -lrb- alias ansori -rrb- , rois -lrb- also known as iwan darmwan -rrb- , hasan and apuy .
the bomb attack was blamed on the jemaah islamiah group national police chief d 'ai bachtiar said sogir had played a bomb-making role , and rois had been responsible for recruiting heri golun , the suicide bomber who died in the blast .
they were captured in the west javan town of bogor , about 60km from the indonesian capital , by a special team of american-trained anti-terror police .
according to the police , the suspects were all wearing small bags tied around their waists , containing home-made bombs designed to be detonated in the event of imminent capture .
but for some reason the individual 's suicide packs were not used .
masterminds still at large police officers said the arrests were not immediately announced for fear of compromising the hunt for other militants still on the run .
the authorities are still hunting two malaysian militants , azahari husin and noordin mohamed top , whom they suspect masterminded the attack , and to have been involved in other bombings linked to jemaah islamiah , including the 2002 attack on the nightclubs in bali .
police hope the latest men to be arrested will help them in their search .
australian foreign minister alexander downer congratulated police on the arrests .
" we welcome the work that the indonesian national police are doing now in following up the various leads that have become available , " he told reporters .
" they have been vigorous in tracking down and trying to bring to justice those responsible , " he said .

inspectors have issued eight improvement and four prohibition notices at businesses in peterborough .
staff working at height and unsafe works ' transport brought most concern .
as a result of the findings , inspectors will carry out further checks in the city , said mike gibb , hm principal inspector for the area .
mr gibb said : " our visits concentrated on workplace transport and working at height , but we also looked at the control of occupational asthma , slips , trips and manual handling risks .
firms warned " most of the companies targeted in the blitz had received a letter from hse advising that inspectors would be in the area in november , and the letter pointed out the areas of risk that would be targeted .
" the inspectors were therefore disappointed that several serious matters were found which resulted in enforcement notices being served . "
improvement notices are issued when there is a breach of the law but no immediate risk ; the firm typically has two months to comply .
a prohibition notice means there is an immediate risk and the business must stop the relevant activity until the problem is fixed to the hse 's satisfaction or risk prosecution .
hse inspectors are also visiting firms in broxbourne , watford , dunstable , hemel hempstead , welwyn garden city , hatfield , bedford , biggleswade , sandy , cambridge , st albans , wisbech , luton and royston .

the commons leader told bbc news : " if we are tough on crime and on terrorism , as labour is , then i think britain will be safer under labour . "
tory shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said saying britain was safe from terror under labour was a challenge to terrorists .
he accused mr hain of wrongly making terror a party political issue .
mr hain told bbc breakfast the government wanted to " make sure britain is much safer from terrorists -lsb- and -rsb- organised crime " .
" the tories and the liberal democrats opposed lots of our measures against terrorism . "
key measures id cards creating serious organised crime agency drug tests for minor offenders offering schools more freedom eu constitution referendum rules queen 's speech : at-a-glance full text of speech watch the speech he earlier told the bbc : " we have to create a safer , more secure country and it is our labour party that is achieving that .
" it 's our assertion that we are providing more security and safety for this country and its citizens than alternative policies . "
he added that he believed " the risk would be lower under labour " , because of the measures it was planning to deal with the terrorist threat .
the liberal democrats branded mr hain 's stance as " disgusting " .
and mr ancram told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " it 's totally at variance with what the prime minister was saying - that the issues were now going to be domestic .
" he 's trying to raise the whole question of terrorism again in order to scaremonger .
he obviously has no confidence in his domestic programme .
" he 's trying to raise the ante on terrorism .
he 's trying to create a climate of fear in this country , which i think is a very dangerous thing to do .
" it is an irresponsible thing to do .
he 's playing party politics with an issue that is above and beyond party politics . "
' climate of fear ' liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said : " this is a disgusting claim from the leader of the house of commons who in his role should know better than most that all parties are united in their concern to keep britain safe from terrorism .
" the kind of claim george bush 's campaign team made in the us against the democrats will not go down well in britain . "
downing street said mr hain was simply saying that the planned measures were there to make the country more secure .
" what he is not doing is attempting to create a climate of fear or make a party political point . "
a spokesman added that the issue would only become party political if the opposition parties disagreed with the government .

the welsh company which owns eight airports , including cardiff , belfast and luton was approached by travel and construction firm abertis .
almost a fifth of tbi is owned by the family of founder stan thomas , who built a business empire selling meat pies , and they will gain £ 100m .
mr thomas , 62 , said the deal offered 92.5p a share , and the board has recommended that it is accepted .
mr thomas said there would be no impact on jobs .
he said he believed abertis had the financial muscle to expand the company .
he said : " their intention is be become global airport owners .
we think at this moment in time that it 's a fair offer . "
tbi has been the subject of bids before .
the french construction firm vinci dropped a bid for the firm after the terrorism attacks of 11 september 2001 .
but last week tbi 's share price soared to a three year high- after it confirmed it was in the early stage of takeover talks .
in january , german construction group hochtief said it was no longer considering a bid for tbi .
tbi has said it was benefiting from expansion by low cost airlines carriers easyjet and ryanair .
earlier this week it said pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of september had risen 167 % to £ 19.2m -lrb- $ 35.6m -rrb- , compared with the same period in 2003 .
as well as cardiff , luton and belfast , tbi also owns stockholm skavsta and orlando sanford airports .

materials scientists from oxford and nottingham universities performed chemical reactions inside tiny tubes of carbon atoms known as nanotubes .
essentially , these are sheets of graphite an atom thick that are folded back on themselves to form cylinders .
they were used to force molecules into long straight chains , reports the journal chemical communications .
as far as new materials are concerned , the sky is the limit david britz , university of oxford david britz , at oxford , and andrei khlobystov , at nottingham , were able to observe the results of these reactions with an electron microscope .
the work has made it into the guinness book of world records .
the nano-sized test tubes are so tiny that around 300 billion would fit on to a full stop .
the technique could help improve industrial processes employing reactions in which single molecules join together to form long chains called polymers .
chain reaction in this study , the molecules being joined were buckminsterfullerene oxides .
under normal circumstances , these would connect up into a twisted polymer that has many branches , like a tree .
when the same reactions take place in the nanotubes , the oxides are forced into a straight line with no branches .
this is because they are confined by the nanotube .
in other words , the molecules formed a much better quality polymer when the reaction took place inside the tubes .
" the idea is that you can make the same materials you made before but potentially much more easily , at a cheaper price and with fewer environmental controls , " mr britz told the bbc news website .
so far , the researchers have only reacted buckminsterfullerene oxide inside the nanotubes .
but they envisage that important polymers such as polyethylene , whose molecular shape is straightforward to control , could potentially be synthesised inside nanotubes .
' sky 's the limit ' catalysts currently used to make straight-chain -lrb- high quality -rrb- polyethylene are sensitive to air and water .
this means the material has to be synthesised in vats with a carefully controlled environment .
nano-test tubes could possibly provide an alternative to this process .
but , said andrei khlobystov at nottingham : " more studies are needed to understand how our method can be used for real , practical applications " and mr britz added : " -lsb- our technique -rsb- is generally a way to constrain what you 're making - to remove a degree of freedom when you 're carrying out a reaction . "
the tiny test tubes have an inner diameter of about 1.2 nanometres -lrb- billionths of a metre -rrb- and they are about two micrometres -lrb- millionths of a metre -rrb- long .
they have a volume of two " zeptolitres " .
the zeptolitre is currently the second smallest defined unit of volume .
researchers hope that the technique could also be used to synthesise entirely new types of materials .
" as far as new materials are concerned , the sky is the limit .
with enough creativity you could come up with plenty of uses for one-dimensional cavities , " said mr britz .

the settlement to the federal communications commission -lrb- fcc -rrb- ends a long-running saga dating back to 2001 .
the fcc was looking into 50 shows , including those by " shock jock " howard stern and two new york djs .
stern recently announced he was leaving viacom while the two djs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church .

under the teach first scheme , recruits begin teaching after 10 weeks and become qualified after two years on-the -job training in teaching and business .
but peter peacock described tory support for the programme as " reckless , disastrous and shabby " cost-cutting .
the tories said mr peacock 's standpoint was " parochial and petty " .
teach first is designed to target deprived inner-city areas .
the conservatives want it piloted in cities like edinburgh and glasgow , but in a labour party letter to their education spokesman lord james douglas-hamilton , mr peacock attacked the support as " reckless " plans to cut costs .
labour would have been well advised to say they were open to all ideas brian taylor bbc scotland political editor the tories have now hit back , saying that mr peacock was completely out of step with his own prime minister , who has backed the london scheme , and out of touch with the needs of scottish schools .
lord james told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " all that i was asking was that this matter should be properly and professionally considered and he is not even prepared to lift his eyes beyond the english border and simply wo n't consider ideas from outwith scotland .
" i think that is too narrow-minded in scotland 's open-minded society . "
but the minister insisted the criticism was not directed at the scheme itself .
he said : " what i 've described as reckless , disastrous and shabby is the conservative plans in scotland to cut the education budget by £ 600m . "
mr peacock has been accused of having " narrow " horizons mr peacock conceded that he regretted if the comments appeared to condemn teach first .
he added : " we are actually well ahead of what 's happening in england and that 's why we do n't need to look at this particular scheme .
" we 've been investing in our areas of deprivation , we 've already considered the things that lord james was asking me to consider and that 's why we 're putting extra staff into those schools and will put even more staff in . "
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor said : " peter peacock went into this all guns blazing in this attempt to prove the tories were trying to cut corners and really it was a daft letter to send .
" labour would have been well advised to say they were open to all ideas and always willing to consider ways to improve scottish education , rather than trying to turn this into this full-scale attack . "
business skills when the scheme was introduced in england , there were concerns that the business skills the recruits learn would see them leave the profession after just two years .
the scheme , introduced in london last year , is based on one which runs in the us .
brett wigdortz , chief executive of teach first , said : " a lot of top graduates are probably very interested in staying in edinburgh and would be interested in the scheme if we were up there .
" but we 'd really have to see if the scottish executive or the government officials would be interested in having us move up there . "
a labour party spokesman said : " aside from the obvious point that education is devolved , the letter implies no criticism of someone who presides over a separate education system elsewhere in the world to say that a scheme is not appropriate for scotland . "
