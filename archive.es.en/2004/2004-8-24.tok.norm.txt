carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2004 opinion : torturously slow diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a victim of a much too drawn-out conflict darfur 's rebel groups are meeting in nigeria , but not much is expected to come of it .
that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : an impotent international community the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .

" a police officer called in to investigate said , " bestiality is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison . " a separate report said an outraged woman in the audience alerted police after witnessing scenes of urination and simulated rape and oral sex during the play 's opening night .
the play is also said to have encouraged two audience members to come on stage and masturbate to make it more interactive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sonia segura types on a keyboard underwater in a perspex tube in a scene from the controversial spanish production xxx .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.08.2004 a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's east side gallery is a major tourist draw the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .
but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .

the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .

he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .

" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .

at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .

however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.08.2004 critics slam oslo museum 's security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scream and madonna were snatched at gunpoint on sunday following the spectacular robbery of two masterpieces by norwegian artist edvard munch , a growing chorus of critics on tuesday took the oslo museum that housed the works to task for insufficient security measures . " some of our national treasures are given too little respect , " wrote the dagbladet newspaper in norway .
" it 's almost as easy as robbing a newsstand , " wrote the daily aftenposten .
both were , of course , referring to sunday 's armed robbery at the edvard munch museum in oslo , where thieves made away with two famous works by the artist including the world-famous " scream " and a second painting titled " madonna " before frightened visitors . both paintings were affixed to the museum 's wall by wires that were supposed to trigger an alarm that would alert the nearby police precinct if moved .
however , two museum visitors who were there at the time of the robbery told reporters they had n't heard any alarm at the it " took 15 to 20 minutes before the police arrived . "
following the thefts , museum director gunnar soerensen announced he would conduct a review of the museum 's security precautions and also consider the installation of metal detectors at the entrance .
meanwhile , oslo 's mayor , erling lae , praised the museum 's security guards .
" the guards found themselves in a very difficult situation .
they conducted themselves very well and did a fantastic job , " lae told the norwegian news agency ntb .
fire and acts of god , but not theft the paintings had been insured against damage but , due to their worth , not against theft .
" the pictures were insured in case of fire or damage from water , but not for theft or burglary , " said john oeyaas of oslo forsikring , which is responsible for insuring the assets of the city of oslo .
" they are irreplaceable works and it makes no sense to insure them against theft , " he said .
some experts had speculated that as the works should be impossible to sell owing to their fame , it was possible the thieves had stolen them with the aim of blackmailing insurance companies .
the collection of the munch museum , which comprises 1,100 paintings , 3,000 drawings and 18,000 etchings , is insured for € 61.2 million -lrb- $ 74.3 million -rrb- , but experts believe that " the scream " alone is worth that amount .
others said the museum should have taken better precautions to protect the cultural heritage it houses .
but the head of oslo 's national museum , sune nordgren rejected suggestions that the museum should place its most precious artworks in hermetically sealed glass cabinets .
" we can not lock up our pieces of art because we want to show them to a large audience , " nordgren said .
the search continues meanwhile , police are continuing to comb the norwegian capital looking for the thieves who made off with the famous paintings on sunday .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

" a police officer called in to investigate said , " bestiality is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison . " a separate report said an outraged woman in the audience alerted police after witnessing scenes of urination and simulated rape and oral sex during the play 's opening night .
the play is also said to have encouraged two audience members to come on stage and masturbate to make it more interactive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sonia segura types on a keyboard underwater in a perspex tube in a scene from the controversial spanish production xxx .

others asked for a ticket refund . freedom of expression ? " first we 'll probe whether the video is covered by the right to freedom of expression , " a spokeswoman for hamburg 's state prosecutor said .
she added that no charges had been filed relating to the play .
" we 're investigating in general against all responsible for the performance , " she added . it 's not the first time that the spanish group has run into trouble for the controversial play .
two years ago it created a furor when it opened in frankfurt .
last year the spanish production met with protests and police investigations in london . meanwhile the kampnagel theater in hamburg , famous for its experimental performances , has announced it has dropped the offensive video from the performance . " apart from that , the play will continue unchanged , " a spokesman for the theater told news agency dpa .
" we reckon that the investigation will be dropped because ' xxx ' is an entire artwork , " he added . hamburg 's cultural ministry has thrown its weight behind the theater .
" it 's an important and correct play , it plays with the boundaries between pornography and art , " spokesman björn marzahn told dpa . the ministry , he said , welcomed the fact that the kampnagel theater had reacted so promptly to the criticism and excised out the controversial video from the play . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a violent , drug-addled , hooker-filled opera angers sponsors berlin 's theatre-goers are notoriously hard to shock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.08.2004 germany braced to break stability pact again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stabillity pact was designed to protect the value of the euro recently compiled data from destatis , the german federal statistics office , indicates that germany will break the european union 's stability and growth pact for the third year in a row in 2004 . germany 's public deficit soared to a massive 4.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the first six months , according to recently compiled data .
that takes the country dangerously close to breaching the european stability and growth pact for the thrid year in a row .
under the terms of the pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , was in breach of that limit in both 2002 and 2003 .
and the government has warned that it expected the deficit ratio to exceed 3.0 percent again this year .
third time unlucky the federal statistics office , destatis , calculated on tuesday that the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totaled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to 4.0 percent of gdp , which amounted to € 1.07 trillion in the same period .
in the corresponding period a year earlier , the german deficit ratio had stood at 3.6 percent .
and for 2003 as a whole , the deficit amounted to 3.8 percent of gdp .
both the statistics office and the finance ministry insisted that the half-yearly figures could not be extrapolated for the year as a whole .
but it is widely accepted that the full-year deficit ratio will be in breach of the 3.0 percent rule .
at the end of july , bundesbank president axel weber had already said that the 2004 deficit ratio " could well exceed " last year 's level of 3.9 percent .
berlin has pledged to bring the deficit back within eu limits in 2005 .
but many experts remain skeptical whether that goal can be achieved and bundesbank chief weber estimated a further € 7 billion in belt-tightening measures would be necessary .
eu anger at repeat offenders germany and a growing number of other euro zone countries have failed to rein in their budgets sufficiently , much to the ire of the european commission in brussels and the european central bank .
the repeated violations of the budget rules by germany and france triggered so-called excessive deficit procedures against the euro zone 's economic heavyweights .
the issue even sparked an eu-wide crisis in which the budgetary sinners , who were calling for a relaxation of the rules , were pitted against smaller countries who had taken painful measures to get their finances in order .
and the situation escalated further when the eu council of ministers decided last november to let berlin and paris off the hook .
incensed , the eu commission sought to oppose the decision by taking the case to the european court of justice .
europe 's highest court eventually found that the council of ministers was indeed wrong to let off the two budgetary sinners . but it added that euro zone governments had the right to throw out the commission 's advice regarding what action to take to bring down their deficits .
economic signs regularly bring hope evidence that the economy is finally picking up could make the german government 's task of cutting its deficit easier .
" positive second-quarter growth strengthens our conviction " that the deficit ratio will fall back below 3.0 percent next year , a finance ministry spokesman told news agency afp .
according to separate data published by destatis on tuesday , the german economy grew by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2004 , a slightly faster rate of growth than the 0.4 percent clocked up in the previous three months .
however , the slight pick up in growth was solely attributable to strong foreign demand for german-made goods , with exports rising by 3.2 percent in the april-june period , destatis said .
by contrast , domestic demand remained weak , contracting by 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis in the period from april to june , after already falling by 0.8 percent in the previous three months , destatis calculated .
the lop-sided nature of recovery could become even more of a problem if drastic social reforms and news of continued high unemployment make consumers even less ready to spend .
furthermore , the soaring price of oil could also put the brakes on economic growth and jeopardize the german government 's growth targets for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

under the terms of the pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , was in breach of that limit in both 2002 and 2003 .
and the government has warned that it expected the deficit ratio to exceed 3.0 percent again this year .
third time unlucky the federal statistics office , destatis , calculated on tuesday that the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totaled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to 4.0 percent of gdp , which amounted to € 1.07 trillion in the same period .
in the corresponding period a year earlier , the german deficit ratio had stood at 3.6 percent .
and for 2003 as a whole , the deficit amounted to 3.8 percent of gdp .
both the statistics office and the finance ministry insisted that the half-yearly figures could not be extrapolated for the year as a whole .
but it is widely accepted that the full-year deficit ratio will be in breach of the 3.0 percent rule .
at the end of july , bundesbank president axel weber had already said that the 2004 deficit ratio " could well exceed " last year 's level of 3.9 percent .
berlin has pledged to bring the deficit back within eu limits in 2005 .
but many experts remain skeptical whether that goal can be achieved and bundesbank chief weber estimated a further € 7 billion in belt-tightening measures would be necessary .
eu anger at repeat offenders germany and a growing number of other euro zone countries have failed to rein in their budgets sufficiently , much to the ire of the european commission in brussels and the european central bank .
the repeated violations of the budget rules by germany and france triggered so-called excessive deficit procedures against the euro zone 's economic heavyweights .
the issue even sparked an eu-wide crisis in which the budgetary sinners , who were calling for a relaxation of the rules , were pitted against smaller countries who had taken painful measures to get their finances in order .
and the situation escalated further when the eu council of ministers decided last november to let berlin and paris off the hook .
incensed , the eu commission sought to oppose the decision by taking the case to the european court of justice .
europe 's highest court eventually found that the council of ministers was indeed wrong to let off the two budgetary sinners . but it added that euro zone governments had the right to throw out the commission 's advice regarding what action to take to bring down their deficits .
economic signs regularly bring hope evidence that the economy is finally picking up could make the german government 's task of cutting its deficit easier .
" positive second-quarter growth strengthens our conviction " that the deficit ratio will fall back below 3.0 percent next year , a finance ministry spokesman told news agency afp .
according to separate data published by destatis on tuesday , the german economy grew by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2004 , a slightly faster rate of growth than the 0.4 percent clocked up in the previous three months .
however , the slight pick up in growth was solely attributable to strong foreign demand for german-made goods , with exports rising by 3.2 percent in the april-june period , destatis said .
by contrast , domestic demand remained weak , contracting by 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis in the period from april to june , after already falling by 0.8 percent in the previous three months , destatis calculated .
the lop-sided nature of recovery could become even more of a problem if drastic social reforms and news of continued high unemployment make consumers even less ready to spend .

that takes the country dangerously close to breaching the european stability and growth pact for the thrid year in a row .
under the terms of the pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , was in breach of that limit in both 2002 and 2003 .
and the government has warned that it expected the deficit ratio to exceed 3.0 percent again this year .
third time unlucky the federal statistics office , destatis , calculated on tuesday that the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totaled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to 4.0 percent of gdp , which amounted to € 1.07 trillion in the same period .
in the corresponding period a year earlier , the german deficit ratio had stood at 3.6 percent .
and for 2003 as a whole , the deficit amounted to 3.8 percent of gdp .
both the statistics office and the finance ministry insisted that the half-yearly figures could not be extrapolated for the year as a whole .
but it is widely accepted that the full-year deficit ratio will be in breach of the 3.0 percent rule .
at the end of july , bundesbank president axel weber had already said that the 2004 deficit ratio " could well exceed " last year 's level of 3.9 percent .
berlin has pledged to bring the deficit back within eu limits in 2005 .
but many experts remain skeptical whether that goal can be achieved and bundesbank chief weber estimated a further € 7 billion in belt-tightening measures would be necessary .
eu anger at repeat offenders germany and a growing number of other euro zone countries have failed to rein in their budgets sufficiently , much to the ire of the european commission in brussels and the european central bank .
the repeated violations of the budget rules by germany and france triggered so-called excessive deficit procedures against the euro zone 's economic heavyweights .
the issue even sparked an eu-wide crisis in which the budgetary sinners , who were calling for a relaxation of the rules , were pitted against smaller countries who had taken painful measures to get their finances in order .
and the situation escalated further when the eu council of ministers decided last november to let berlin and paris off the hook .
incensed , the eu commission sought to oppose the decision by taking the case to the european court of justice .
europe 's highest court eventually found that the council of ministers was indeed wrong to let off the two budgetary sinners . but it added that euro zone governments had the right to throw out the commission 's advice regarding what action to take to bring down their deficits .
economic signs regularly bring hope evidence that the economy is finally picking up could make the german government 's task of cutting its deficit easier .
" positive second-quarter growth strengthens our conviction " that the deficit ratio will fall back below 3.0 percent next year , a finance ministry spokesman told news agency afp .
according to separate data published by destatis on tuesday , the german economy grew by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2004 , a slightly faster rate of growth than the 0.4 percent clocked up in the previous three months .
however , the slight pick up in growth was solely attributable to strong foreign demand for german-made goods , with exports rising by 3.2 percent in the april-june period , destatis said .
by contrast , domestic demand remained weak , contracting by 0.1 percent on a quarterly basis in the period from april to june , after already falling by 0.8 percent in the previous three months , destatis calculated .
the lop-sided nature of recovery could become even more of a problem if drastic social reforms and news of continued high unemployment make consumers even less ready to spend .
furthermore , the soaring price of oil could also put the brakes on economic growth and jeopardize the german government 's growth targets for this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.08.2004 monday demonstrations attract fewer marchers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests go on despite the dwindling numbers of marchers the fourth week of " monday demonstrations " against german chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reform measures drew tens of thousands of marchers across the country but figures were down from the previous week . in what have become regular weekly demonstrations against the german government 's labor market and social security reform plans , protestors once again took to the streets in cities across germany in the latest of the new wave of " monday demonstrations . "
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .

however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .

compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .

hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2004 opinion : torturously slow diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a victim of a much too drawn-out conflict darfur 's rebel groups are meeting in nigeria , but not much is expected to come of it .
that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2004 opinion : torturously slow diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a victim of a much too drawn-out conflict darfur 's rebel groups are meeting in nigeria , but not much is expected to come of it .
that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : an impotent international community the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .
there was also a rally in the bavarian capital munich for the first time , with about 200 protesting in front of the labour office . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-communists ride high on protest wave the success of germany 's " monday demonstrations , " are symbolic of the unexpected return of the reformed communists , who took a drubbing in the last federal elections but are ahead of the chancellor 's party in some polls .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .

" a police officer called in to investigate said , " bestiality is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison . " a separate report said an outraged woman in the audience alerted police after witnessing scenes of urination and simulated rape and oral sex during the play 's opening night .
the play is also said to have encouraged two audience members to come on stage and masturbate to make it more interactive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sonia segura types on a keyboard underwater in a perspex tube in a scene from the controversial spanish production xxx .
many theater-goers who went to see the 105-minute performance at hamburg 's kampnagel theater are said to have walked out in disgust halfway through .
others asked for a ticket refund . freedom of expression ? " first we 'll probe whether the video is covered by the right to freedom of expression , " a spokeswoman for hamburg 's state prosecutor said .
she added that no charges had been filed relating to the play .
" we 're investigating in general against all responsible for the performance , " she added . it 's not the first time that the spanish group has run into trouble for the controversial play .
two years ago it created a furor when it opened in frankfurt .
last year the spanish production met with protests and police investigations in london . meanwhile the kampnagel theater in hamburg , famous for its experimental performances , has announced it has dropped the offensive video from the performance . " apart from that , the play will continue unchanged , " a spokesman for the theater told news agency dpa .
" we reckon that the investigation will be dropped because ' xxx ' is an entire artwork , " he added . hamburg 's cultural ministry has thrown its weight behind the theater .
" it 's an important and correct play , it plays with the boundaries between pornography and art , " spokesman björn marzahn told dpa . the ministry , he said , welcomed the fact that the kampnagel theater had reacted so promptly to the criticism and excised out the controversial video from the play . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a violent , drug-addled , hooker-filled opera angers sponsors berlin 's theatre-goers are notoriously hard to shock .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2004 opinion : torturously slow diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a victim of a much too drawn-out conflict darfur 's rebel groups are meeting in nigeria , but not much is expected to come of it .
that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : an impotent international community the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.08.2004 a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's east side gallery is a major tourist draw the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .
but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

graner , who posed smiling in several snaps behind a pyramid of naked prison inmates , is accused of photographing a detainee being dragged on a leash by private first class lynndie england .
graner is also said to have forced prisoners to strip naked and masturbate in front of each other , and one to simulate oral sex on another , before taking pictures . he is also charged with committing adultery , an offence against military discipline . potentially incriminating images graner 's lawyers had tried to prevent the use of the photographs during the hearings , arguing that graner had not been fully in control of his mental facilities as he was awoken in the middle of the night in january and had sleepily agreed to having his room searched .
earlier , a military investigator referred to cds with hundreds of photographs showing detainees being abused during the search of graner 's room . however , judge james pohl dismissed a motion to strike the potentially incriminating photographs from his court martial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
guy womack , one of graner 's lawyers , said he was unimpressed with the judge 's decision and said the defense would continue to stress the fact that us soldiers in abu ghraib were simply following orders that they believed to be legal to soften up detainees . graner , who appeared relatively indifferent during the hearings , said he had been under enormous stress and had only slept three to four hours a night when he was interrogated about the scandal in january 2004 and his room had been searched . dressed in army fatigues , graner spoke about the long hours in iraq , sometimes 17 hours a day transferring detainees and the pressure of being under fire .
" we worked every day … several of our platoon had taken fire .
both my roommates had been injured , took blasts … it was one of the most stressful times , " graner said . trial in baghdad will not be fair graner 's lawyers are also contesting a transfer of the court martial to baghdad , which seems likely .
the hearing at the us military base in mannheim is supposed to be an exception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graner remained unmoved by the proceedings in mannheim .
graner 's lawyers argue their client has no chance of a fair trial in baghdad and it will be impossible to find an unbiased jury among graner 's peers given the publicity surrounding events at abu ghraib .
" while the prejudice would be worldwide , it is extremely acute in baghdad as the feeling would be that he has hurt the mission , " captain jay heath , graner 's second lawyer , told the judge . heath also pointed out that in the face of international condemnation of the torture photographs that went around the world , graner 's colleagues also blamed him for causing the death of some us soldiers .
graner 's lawyers have also argued that it will be hard to persuade civilian witnesses to travel to iraq .
however , judge pohl said it was too premature to rule on the matter . judge blames us for moving too slowly the judge has also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal , warning he might dismiss charges against at least one of the accused soldiers unless various probes were wrapped up by december . judge pohl reacted angrily during graner 's hearing when he was told by prosecutors that us army investigators had assigned just one person to go through " hundreds of thousands " of documents on the abu ghraib classified computer server .
" and in what millennium will that be finished ? "
pohl asked .
" the government has to figure out what they want to do with the prosecution of this case , " the judge said . in addition to graner , three other accused - 29-year-old specialist megan ambuhl , staff sergeant ivan frederick , 37 and 26-year-old sergeant javal davis , all members of the 372nd military police company , a reserve unit based in cresaptown , maryland , face hearings in mannheim . a total of seven us soldiers stand accused of abusing inmates at the baghdad prison .

" a police officer called in to investigate said , " bestiality is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison . " a separate report said an outraged woman in the audience alerted police after witnessing scenes of urination and simulated rape and oral sex during the play 's opening night .
the play is also said to have encouraged two audience members to come on stage and masturbate to make it more interactive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sonia segura types on a keyboard underwater in a perspex tube in a scene from the controversial spanish production xxx .
many theater-goers who went to see the 105-minute performance at hamburg 's kampnagel theater are said to have walked out in disgust halfway through .
others asked for a ticket refund . freedom of expression ? " first we 'll probe whether the video is covered by the right to freedom of expression , " a spokeswoman for hamburg 's state prosecutor said .
she added that no charges had been filed relating to the play .
" we 're investigating in general against all responsible for the performance , " she added . it 's not the first time that the spanish group has run into trouble for the controversial play .
two years ago it created a furor when it opened in frankfurt .
last year the spanish production met with protests and police investigations in london . meanwhile the kampnagel theater in hamburg , famous for its experimental performances , has announced it has dropped the offensive video from the performance . " apart from that , the play will continue unchanged , " a spokesman for the theater told news agency dpa .
" we reckon that the investigation will be dropped because ' xxx ' is an entire artwork , " he added . hamburg 's cultural ministry has thrown its weight behind the theater .
" it 's an important and correct play , it plays with the boundaries between pornography and art , " spokesman björn marzahn told dpa . the ministry , he said , welcomed the fact that the kampnagel theater had reacted so promptly to the criticism and excised out the controversial video from the play . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a violent , drug-addled , hooker-filled opera angers sponsors berlin 's theatre-goers are notoriously hard to shock .

he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .

some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop .

" we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .

but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .

" a police officer called in to investigate said , " bestiality is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison . " a separate report said an outraged woman in the audience alerted police after witnessing scenes of urination and simulated rape and oral sex during the play 's opening night .
the play is also said to have encouraged two audience members to come on stage and masturbate to make it more interactive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sonia segura types on a keyboard underwater in a perspex tube in a scene from the controversial spanish production xxx .
many theater-goers who went to see the 105-minute performance at hamburg 's kampnagel theater are said to have walked out in disgust halfway through .
others asked for a ticket refund . freedom of expression ? " first we 'll probe whether the video is covered by the right to freedom of expression , " a spokeswoman for hamburg 's state prosecutor said .
she added that no charges had been filed relating to the play .
" we 're investigating in general against all responsible for the performance , " she added . it 's not the first time that the spanish group has run into trouble for the controversial play .
two years ago it created a furor when it opened in frankfurt .
last year the spanish production met with protests and police investigations in london . meanwhile the kampnagel theater in hamburg , famous for its experimental performances , has announced it has dropped the offensive video from the performance . " apart from that , the play will continue unchanged , " a spokesman for the theater told news agency dpa .
" we reckon that the investigation will be dropped because ' xxx ' is an entire artwork , " he added . hamburg 's cultural ministry has thrown its weight behind the theater .
" it 's an important and correct play , it plays with the boundaries between pornography and art , " spokesman björn marzahn told dpa . the ministry , he said , welcomed the fact that the kampnagel theater had reacted so promptly to the criticism and excised out the controversial video from the play . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a violent , drug-addled , hooker-filled opera angers sponsors berlin 's theatre-goers are notoriously hard to shock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.08.2004 a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's east side gallery is a major tourist draw the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .
but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

that 's because everything in africa - even suffering , dying and peace processes - takes longer than in the rest of the world . what 's taking place almost simultaneously in the sudanese capital of khartoum and the nigerian capital of abuja is a lesson in modern diplomacy and international relations .
in abuja , the heads of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- - led by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo and au commission chairman alpha oumar konare - are mediating negotiations between the two rebel groups sla and jem and a second-class delegation from the sudanese government . in khartoum , british foreign minister jack straw is currently collecting facts about his country 's former colony .
others who have done the same before him include un secretary general kofi annan , us secretary of state colin powell and german foreign minister joschka fischer .
it 's a cynical statement that captures in a nutshell africa 's marginal status in the western world . and that despite the fact that the situation in darfur is clear : a human tragedy , that initially arose from a local conflict , is unfolding there and threatening to snowball into a trans-border catastrophe . everything 's different in africa the international community has - at least , ostensibly - reacted .
after all , when was the last time there was a comparable case , when leading and influential politicians of this world lined up to get involved in an issue so far away from the world centers .
but was it of any use ?
only to a limited extent . that 's because the clocks in africa tick differently - in some cases , vastly differently .
and negotiations over war and peace , over existence and non-existence in africa always defy forms and rules of modern diplomacy .
no wonder then that western diplomats and observers often helplessly and uncomprehendingly view events such as the negotiations in abuja or talks in sudan . personal power is still the measure of all things in africa .
and those who 've clambered to the top rung of the government defend it with tooth and nail , even with violence if necessary , and against any and all challengers .
compromises and giving up untenable positions is still largely alien to the political leadership in africa . only a glimpse in the abyss can sway the african politician , but then only amid much talk of respect and saving face .
that , however , takes time , a whole lot of it , during which many people die miserably .
but that in itself is n't a real political criteria for african leaders to start immediate negotiations to end conflicts . africa not a priority in the west this pattern is strengthened by the international conflict zone hierarchy in which africa - including sudan - are way down on the list of priorities .
and since there are no substantial raw materials or even oil interests at stake in this case , the international community declares itself to be in no position to intervene massively and robustly .
instead , it tries to " africanize " solving the conflict - with painful , tragic consequences . the learning process is agonizing for africa , but also for the international community .
still , there is some movement in africa 's security policies , slow though it may be , borne out on the backs of the population whose ability to bear suffering apparently has n't reached its limits . only at that point , it seems , would africa 's political elite no longer be in a position to exploit the suffering of the people solely in their own interests . heinrich bergstresser -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid agencies face increasing odds in sudan relief organizations in sudan face not only a struggle with refugees and the threat of famine and disease in the war-torn , almost lawless region of darfur but also against bureaucracy , instability and lack of cohesion .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company . " we 're a good soccer team and face a difficult away game , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute german carmaker daimlerchrysler reached a cost-cutting deal with workers friday , securing 6,000 jobs at a plant near stuttgart .

carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday . once known for its innovative approach to personnel problems , europe 's leading car manufacturer may be on a collision course with trade unions .
human resources head peter hartz announced monday that employees would have to engage in belt-tightening measures and accept a wage and salary freeze for 24 months as well as more flexible working hours . " there is no scope for pay increases , " hartz said at a news conference in wolfsburg , where the company has its headquarters .
" we can not close our eyes to the worldwide competitive situation … the european automotive market above all is discouraging .
in germany , in particular , after years of stagnation there are still no signs of recovery , " said hartz , who is also author of german labor market reforms currently being implemented federally to the tune of mass protests . pay talks for the 103,000 employees at vw 's six german plants are merely weeks away .
last week , powerful trade union ig metall said it would demand a 4 percent increase in wages and salaries and guarantees that jobs will be retained for 10 years .
already , union representatives have deemed hartz 's plans excessive and unrealistic .
looking for guarantees all told , vw aims to cut current personnel costs of € 6.8 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- by around € 2 billion by 2011 .
hartz said that compared to its most important competitors , vw had a significant disadvantage in terms of personnel costs at its german plants .
but he said in return vw would voluntarily commit to retaining its more than 176,544 in the country . just over a month ago , daimlerchrysler settled a labor dispute that was accompanied by two weeks of protests and strikes .
the german-american car maker had threatened to shift 6,000 jobs from its sindenfingen plant near stuttgart to other locations in bremen and south africa if workers did not agree to trim costs saving the company € 500 million annually .
instead of pursuing pay increase demands , workers accepted reintroduction of the 40-hour work week and pay cuts , while receiving a seven-year guarantee of no lay-offs . hartz 's seven-point plan includes linking 30 percent of pay to performance and only paying overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week , rather than the current 35 hours .
paid breaks and training periods would also be eliminated .
each employee would have an annual account of working hours to allow the company to occupy workers more flexibly . vw has seen its profits slump in 2004 , which the company has blamed on an overall downturn in the international car market .
earnings were down more than 35 percent in the first six months of the year .
ready for a fight ig metall said employees should not be punished for managers mistakes .
hartmut meine , who is due to lead the union 's negotiations with vw , defended salary increases .
" as long as vw can pay a dividend , the employees must also take part in the company 's success , " he said . with 97 percent of vw employees represented by the union , meine remained optimistic that vw employees would present a strong front against the company .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .
conflicting reports most of the latest protests were concentrated in eastern germany , where unemployment in some areas is well over 20 percent , and where the proposed reforms are likely to hit hardest .
in the eastern city of leipzig , organizers said 30,000 people had turned out to demonstrate , although police put the figure at 16,000 .
the cuts will hit an estimated 1 million people in the east where the population is only 16 million , and 1.2 million in the more populous and prosperous western part of the country , which has a population of more than 65 million . the measures will require those on unemployment benefit to use family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves , a policy that has caused horror stories to spread through the heavily jobless east and into the west of the country provoking mass demonstrations . east and west united in protest the fourth weekly protest drew several thousand demonstrators in the eastern towns of magdeburg , halle , chemnitz , gera , zwizkau and schwerin while protests were also gathering steam in the western cities of bochum , stuttgart and mannheim . berlin saw a high turnout of about 15,000 people according to organizers , but again police figures estimated the number of protestors at about half that number .
however , divisions between protesting groups were in evidence in the capital as two rival marches snaked across the city due to opposing views over certain aspects of the reforms .
in the ruling social democrats ' industrial heartland of north-rhine westphalia , some cities recorded double the protestors of the previous week .
around 1,000 demonstrators marched in cologne and 1,200 in dortmund .

"
however , the expected numbers of demonstrators were well below the estimates of organizers . at least 70,000 people in total marched against schröder 's reform measures , set to come into force in january , which will reduce benefits for the long-term jobless and their families . but the number of marchers was significantly lower than the 100,000 protesters projected for the demonstrations organized in 140 cities .
trade unions , left-wing lobby groups and the ex-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , who say the cuts target the poor , were optimistic that more people would protest than the 90,000 participants who took to the streets the previous monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.08.2004 a last stretch of the berlin wall fights fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's east side gallery is a major tourist draw the famous murals painted on the longest standing stretch of the berlin wall are crumbling away with the weather and crowds of souvenir-hungry tourists .
but nothing is being done to save the east side gallery . johnny picks up his pace as the first slab of painted concrete comes into view along the mühlenstrasse in berlin 's friedrichshain district .
he 's reached the start of the 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of murals painted on this once untouchable stretch of the berlin wall . " it 's such a great feeling just touching it , " johnny says , running his hands over the faded mural , which is covered in graffiti and missing large chunks . " i want to take a piece home with me , " he adds , and starts picking away at a part of the wall still flecked with green paint .
his companions protest , but johnny is resolute .
after a few seconds , he holds up a small chip of the wall triumphantly , and then wraps it in a handkerchief for safe-keeping .
johnny 's friend ruth is not impressed .
" i think it 's crazy to have people just picking and picking , " she says , shaking her head .
" i think they need to put some protective coating on it , something needs to be done . " johnny is hardly alone in his desire to take home a piece of the cold war 's most famous symbol .
but that desire , coupled with the damaging effects of berlin 's hot summers and cold , wet winters , is causing the longest remaining stretch of the berlin wall to crumble away . unique artistic achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " bruderkuss " mural at the east side gallery during the summer of 1990 , shortly after the collapse of the east german regime , artists covered a section of the wall along the spree river with murals re-telling german history and bearing slogans of peace .
the east side gallery was born .
some of the murals , such as dmitri vrubel 's " bruderkuss " -lrb- photo -rrb- between former soviet leader leonid brezhnev and east german prime minister eric honecker , have become famous in their own right . in 2000 , the artists ' initiative carried out a partial restoration of the east side gallery , as the murals were already beginning to show signs of wear and tear . now , artist kani alavi is proposing a total restoration of the east side gallery .
at a cost of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.8 million -rrb- the concrete would be stripped , the murals repainted , and then sealed with an anti-graffiti coating .
but where should the money come from ? ownership in question typically , the preservation of historical monuments such as the east side gallery falls to the owners .
the part of the wall in question was given to the district of kreuzberg-friedrichshain in 1990 , but there 's a dispute over whether the gift contract is still binding under current law , and therefore , over who the owners are : the district , the state of berlin , the federal government , or private investors who 've bought land on which the wall stands . such legal squabbles frustrate gerd glanze , who runs the east side gallery souvenir shop . " this important document of our past is coming down and nobody is doing anything about it , " he said .
glanze advocates charging every tourist a fee of € 1 to view the gallery . pay-per-view ? sarah , a tourist from london who made the east side gallery her first stop on her trip to berlin , agrees with glanze 's proposal . " we 've come a long way just to see this and i think it would be good if they maintained it , " she said .
" i think even if they charged to see it people would want to see it , just like you pay to go into a museum .
look at the amount of people here .
the way it looks now i think somebody has to step up and take responsibility for it . " bastian , who 's lived in berlin for 14 years , does n't think the financial responsibility for the gallery 's maintenance should fall to tourists . “ the money should come from the government , not the visitors , " he said .
" the wall is a part of our common german history .
politicians decided to build the wall , let politicians pay for its upkeep as a historic monument . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people stroll past the east side gallery the artists ' initiative says the best solution would be a foundation for the gallery 's restoration , sponsored by the state , the federal government and private donors . the other strategy - one that 's popular among many berliners - is to resist any attempts at artifice , and just let time take its course . " the way -lrb- the wall -rrb- looks now reflects berlin , " said michael b. , a berlin resident who often strolls along the east side gallery , barely giving it a glance .
" it 's typical of the city .
not everything looks perfect here .
if they start preserving it too much , it starts to look fake .
but like this , it looks real . " deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .

every weekend there are thousands of people who turn out for the asian amateur leagues all over the uk , but the numbers fall dramatically when it comes to being a professional .
the asiaeurope festival , hosted by liverpool hope university college at the weekend , was all about showing scouts and coaches the depth of talent in the south asian community , despite the lack of role models in the game .

there are only five south asian professionals in the country and an equally small number in management , but a new football academy plans to change that and get more people involved in the game .
every weekend there are thousands of people who turn out for the asian amateur leagues all over the uk , but the numbers fall dramatically when it comes to being a professional .
the asiaeurope festival , hosted by liverpool hope university college at the weekend , was all about showing scouts and coaches the depth of talent in the south asian community , despite the lack of role models in the game .
one hopeful , yousef , came down from glasgow .
he had played on the youth team of a scottish professional club .
" football means life to me .
i 've played it all my life , it 's my passion , " he said .

" asian football is at the same place that black football was back in the 70s , so it will take time .

a number of premiership clubs sent scouts , including ones from the red and blue teams of the merseyside .

liam higgins , a liverpool community coach , agrees : " we 're trying to make appearances at these events to show there is an interest .
we want to see these players in games . "
a number of people at the event said that racism was not an issue - and neither was a lack of talent when it comes to recruiting asian players .
they said it is the players themselves who are not interested .

a proposal to base the boat on the mainland , which could have seen nearly a third of the island 's 32-strong population leaving , has been dropped .
the service will now be handed over to islanders to run and the ferry will be reclassified as a work boat to overcome regulations on crewing .
islanders say the move will secure the future of their fragile community .
the ferry is the lifeline for the people of foula , which lies 12 miles west of the shetland mainland .
it 's about more than making life better for the islanders , it 's about the survival of the community isabel holbourn however , the boat is currently without a resident skipper and shetland islands council is having difficulty finding anyone willing to move to the island permanently to take up the job .
the local authority had presented three options to the community - continue the current service with relief skippers being flown into the island at huge expense ; base the ferry on the shetland mainland or have the islanders take it over themselves .
community spokeswoman isabel holbourn said : " the ferry is 22 tonnes but is currently in a classification that goes up to 500 tonnes .
" if it was to be designated a work boat , the islanders who work as crew on the ferry and are already qualified ship masters will be allowed to do the job they have been able to do for years .

the welsh development agency confirmed that the discussion with three developers started three months ago .
possible sites have been identified , but there are no definite commitments as yet .
the power stations would be close to the proposed liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- terminals , which are due to start up in late 2007 .
power would be generated in two ways , firstly by using gas supplies from the gas turbines and then by creating steam from exhaust gas at high temperatures .
the electricity supplied would be available to the national grid and also to the total and chevron oil refineries at milford haven .
there is no intention , however , to use oil in the power stations , which are expected to be gas-fired .
the power stations , if they proceed , will take five years to build , and it is expected they would be up and running by 2009 or 2010 .
they would reduce south wales ' dependency on england for electricity supplies .
' fuel supply ' the development of the two lng gas terminals are the key to making the nearby power stations viable and attractive .
the terminals would be connected to the power stations .
work on building a £ 250 million lng terminal by the dragon lng consortium , is expected to start in the autumn , with up to 700 construction jobs and 30 permanent jobs being created .
a 15-year supply deal , announced by british gas owner centrica , was announced earlier this month oil giant exxon mobil has also announced plans to build a similar lng plant on the old esso refinery site nearby .
brian barrows , head of energy at the wda , said the negotiations about the power stations were at " a very early stage " and that there were no plans as such to speak of .
he said the current arrangements with south wales as an importer of electricity , meant an efficiency loss to the national grid each year which was the equivalent of a 250 megawatt power station .
" that is a lot of economic cost to the system and as a result , the grid in west wales is imbalanced , and the grid will pay developers to connect new power stations there , " he said .
" until the advent of the two new lng power stations , there was n't enough gas for a fuel supply for the new power generators and this meant this could n't go ahead . "

missed appointments cost the nhs more than £ 160m a year .
nearly two-thirds of the gps questioned in the survey by developing patient partnerships -lrb- dpp -rrb- backed the idea of fining non-attenders .
gp practices reported that on average , just over 3 % of a practice 's appointments were missed - a reduction on the figures from last year . "
these forgotten millions of missed appointments lead to unavoidable inefficiencies in gp services " dr terry john , developing patient partnerships although the overall figure for missed gp appointments is down by around 3.5 million since last year 's survey , 60 % of practices still find missed appointments a problem .
seventy-two per cent also believe they increase waiting times for those people who need gp appointments .
over two-thirds -lrb- 67 % -rrb- of practices think that patients ' forget ' their appointment , while 26 % think that patients ' feel better ' so simply choose not to attend .
the dpp figures also suggest just under four million practice nurse appointments are missed each year .
the dpp and the institute of healthcare management asked just over 700 gp surgeries in the uk to report missed appointments .
patient education it published its survey as part of its annual ' keep it or cancel it ' campaign .
the initiative aims to remind doctors and patients what they can do to reduce the numbers of cancellations .
dr terry john , a spokesman for the dpp said : " many gp practices are doing all they can to improve access for patients but still a high volume of appointments are being missed .
" these forgotten millions of missed appointments lead to unavoidable inefficiencies in gp services . "
he said patients should let the practice know if they can not attend an appointment , or if they feel better , so the slot can be used by someone else .
a spokesman for the british medical association said : " anything that helps educate patients to let the surgery know when they can not attend is helpful . "
she said patients sometimes tried to contact gps to let them know they would have to miss an appointment , but were unable to get through .
" doctors could help by making sure there is some facility , such as an answerphone , so patients can let them know . "
but she added : " the bma is not in favour of charging patients who miss appointments . "
' responsibilities ' professor david haslam , chairman of the royal college of gps , said : " every gp wants to give high quality care with good access .
every missed appointment is a wasted opportunity for another patient .
" those few patients who repeatedly miss appointments are depriving other patients of care . "
but he said gps could do more to help : " more practices are guaranteeing rapid access , which should make it unnecessary for patients to book a future appointment ' just in case ' . "
simon williams of the patients ' association said : " these figures clearly show how patient education campaigns like ' keep it or cancel it ' have helped reduce the number of missed gp appointments by an impressive 3.5 million .
" while the number of appointments missed remains very high , it clearly shows the effectiveness of initiatives that takes into consideration both doctors and patients . "
a spokesman for the department of health said : " patients are right to expect a modernised , responsive and accessible service .

but idris was cleared of taking part in the 2002 bali bombings , despite confessing his involvement .
the court decided he could not be prosecuted over bali , due to a recent ruling preventing the retrospective use of the law used to charge him .
the anti-terror law was rushed through parliament soon after the bali blasts .
the court said idris , also known as jhoni hendrawan , was involved " in an evil plot " to attack the j w marriott hotel in august 2003 .
he was found guilty of being one of a chain of people who handled the explosives used in the bombing .
but judge asnawi said the charge relating to the bali attack - which killed 202 people in october 2002 - would be rejected in the light of the constitutional court decision last month .
previous confession the indonesian justice system is struggling to cope with that decision , which means that the anti-terrorism law rushed through the courts after the bali attack can not be applied retrospectively to bali suspects themselves .
idris has confessed to a role in the bali bomb attacks idris has already confessed to playing a part in both the bali and marriott hotel attacks - saying both were aimed at the us and " its henchmen who oppress islam " .
he said he was responsible for logistics and transport during the bali bombings , as well as using a mobile telephone to trigger the smallest of the three devices that went off that evening - a parcel bomb close to the us consulate that did little harm .
he has expressed only qualified remorse for his role in the attacks .
speaking at the court on tuesday , he said that if god thought what he did was wrong , he apologised to the victims and their families .
but he added that if god thought what he did was right , he hoped it was accepted .
according to the bbc 's tim johnston in jakarta , indonesia has had notable success in rounding up militants involved in the bali and marriott bombings .
but legal uncertainties persist .
lawyers for the 32 militants already sentenced for the bali attacks have said they will appeal against the verdicts , based on the constitutional court 's ruling .
idris may be the last of those in custody to be sentenced , but the court cases are likely to drag on for years .

the anti-terror law was rushed through parliament soon after the bali blasts .
the court said idris , also known as jhoni hendrawan , was involved " in an evil plot " to attack the j w marriott hotel in august 2003 .
he was found guilty of being one of a chain of people who handled the explosives used in the bombing .
but judge asnawi said the charge relating to the bali attack - which killed 202 people in october 2002 - would be rejected in the light of the constitutional court decision last month .
previous confession the indonesian justice system is struggling to cope with that decision , which means that the anti-terrorism law rushed through the courts after the bali attack can not be applied retrospectively to bali suspects themselves .
idris has confessed to a role in the bali bomb attacks idris has already confessed to playing a part in both the bali and marriott hotel attacks - saying both were aimed at the us and " its henchmen who oppress islam " .
he said he was responsible for logistics and transport during the bali bombings , as well as using a mobile telephone to trigger the smallest of the three devices that went off that evening - a parcel bomb close to the us consulate that did little harm .
he has expressed only qualified remorse for his role in the attacks .
speaking at the court on tuesday , he said that if god thought what he did was wrong , he apologised to the victims and their families .
but he added that if god thought what he did was right , he hoped it was accepted .
according to the bbc 's tim johnston in jakarta , indonesia has had notable success in rounding up militants involved in the bali and marriott bombings .
but legal uncertainties persist .
lawyers for the 32 militants already sentenced for the bali attacks have said they will appeal against the verdicts , based on the constitutional court 's ruling .
idris may be the last of those in custody to be sentenced , but the court cases are likely to drag on for years .

mk airlines spokesman steve anderson said : " as the first operator out of the airport we had a long-term agreement in place with the airport owners , which was only halfway through .

it was essential to the entire country , because it was where much of our food was produced , which meant employment .
today we depend on it no more , and so farmers are paid not only to produce herds and harvests but to care for the fields , the wildlife and the landscape .
the uk no longer needs its countryside , except as a park or a rural museum , so it invests less in it than it once did .
too dear to buy there is nothing necessarily wrong with treating the countryside as an optional extra to national life , so long as we revise our expectations of it .
farm woes farmers receive about 7p for a loaf which sells for 75p the number of farmworkers fell by 12 % from 1998 to 2001 farm incomes are 71 % below their 1995 level there are some rich farmers , but many struggle to survive .
in 1950 they received about 50 pence from every pound spent on food in the uk .
today they receive about eight pence per pound .
in 2003 the profits of one supermarket chain , tesco , equalled 60 % of all uk farmers ' incomes .
the supermarkets ' profits come from those of us who shop there .
one of the most serious impacts of the countryside 's changing role is on people 's ability to live there .
the countryside agency says a lack of affordable housing means the proportion of homeless households in remote rural districts rose by almost 30 % in two years .
unable to compete more people moving out of towns caused house prices to rise faster , the agency said , prompting homelessness charities to warn of a " devastating impact " on rural families .
post office closures are one index of rural problems but many rural households are not poor at all , and poverty is not the main problem for most country people .
a 2004 report commissioned by the department for environment , food and rural affairs , social and economic change and diversity in rural england , made this clear .
it said : " the rural areas of england have undergone considerable demographic , social and economic change over the last three to four decades .
" these changes have led to a much more socially and economically differentiated countryside , much less dependent on agriculture and related activities for employment and generally more prosperous than ever before .
rural services in 2000 about 3,000 rural post offices had closed , with three shutting each week 72 % of rural settlements had no shop , and 29 % of smaller ones no public transport 53 % had no pub : six rural pubs closed each week , and there were fewer than at the norman conquest " despite this ... some parts of rural england still contain areas and settlements experiencing long-standing economic under-performance , social deprivation and lack of services . "

marina popoey lives on the north coast of upolu in samoa and weaves mats for a living .
she is waiting for an internet connection to come to her village so that she can more easily contact her family in australia and new zealand .
they organise the sale of her handicrafts in overseas markets .
" at the moment a letter takes two weeks , " she says .
" with e-mail it 's instant . "
marina 's wish might now be granted as samoa has recently become one of the first island nations in the pacific to adopt a national strategy for information and communications technology -lrb- ict -rrb- .
this is a key component to unlocking overseas aid to pay for computer training , rural telecentres and e-government projects .
the united nations development programme has already pledged us $ 400,000 .
global market samoa is at the the heart of tropical polynesia .
it has a population of 180,000 , but only 30 % presently have access to a basic telephone .
less than 2 % ever use the internet .
but the government plans a major drive to promote online access for all .
" samoa is very isolated from the rest of the world , " says fuatai purcell , secretary of the national ict steering committee .
" it takes four hours to fly to new zealand , the nearest developed country .
ict will reduce the barriers of distance for us . "
she foresees the day when a computer-literate population sells samoan goods such as woven bags and polynesian prints over the internet , promoting economic growth .
the prime minister , tuilaepa sailele aiono malielegaoi , says the advantages from ict in the areas of education and health is potentially limitless .
" i have seen instances where specialists in hospitals thousands and thousands of miles away are providing the valuable direction to local technicians to perform very difficult operations , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
porn concerns in this rush to embrace new technology , there are some warning voices . "
the internet is ok so long as we impose the necessary controls to cut out pornography which would be damaging for our people " tuilaepa sailele aiono malielegaoi , samoan prime minister " one of the things that i worry about is how this exposure is going to impact on the culture , " says ioanna chan-mow , dean of the faculty of science and the national university of samoa .
" we 're exposing ourselves to a whole lot of philosophies and ways of life , bringing in a lot of western values . "
samoan culture is centred around the traditional family unit , each headed by a matai or chief .
attendance at christian church services is high .
of particular concern to many people is internet pornography .
at one of the few private schools which provided pupils with internet access , the pcs had to be moved after it was discovered children had been accessing inappropriate websites .
the prime minister believes the benefits of the internet will far outweigh any disadvantages .
" the internet is ok so long as we impose the necessary controls to cut out pornography which would be damaging for our people , " he says .
" this aspect of control will always be with us . "
net controls the samoan government plans to update and tighten laws to penalise anyone downloading pornography .
but it has backed away from an earlier plan , promoted by the prime minister , to develop a national filter .
this would have required internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to attempt to block pornographic websites .
isps argued this was technically difficult and may have forced them to block legitimate websites , such as those providing health information .
" if developed countries like new zealand , australia and america are struggling with this issue it will be almost impossible for a developing country like samoa to achieve it , " says david main , technical manager for the isp called csl .
" how do you know when a health site is talking about the human anatomy or a sex site is talking about the human body ? "
david prosser 's report from samoa was featured on go digital .
he travelled to samoa to look at the role of technology in development for the bbc world service trust .
the trust is the international development arm of the bbc , tackling poverty with communication development projects .

only a third of samoans have access to a telephone marina popoey lives on the north coast of upolu in samoa and weaves mats for a living .
she is waiting for an internet connection to come to her village so that she can more easily contact her family in australia and new zealand .
they organise the sale of her handicrafts in overseas markets .
" at the moment a letter takes two weeks , " she says .
" with e-mail it 's instant . "
marina 's wish might now be granted as samoa has recently become one of the first island nations in the pacific to adopt a national strategy for information and communications technology -lrb- ict -rrb- .
this is a key component to unlocking overseas aid to pay for computer training , rural telecentres and e-government projects .
the united nations development programme has already pledged us $ 400,000 .
global market samoa is at the the heart of tropical polynesia .
it has a population of 180,000 , but only 30 % presently have access to a basic telephone .
marina popoey is looking forward to having access to e-mail less than 2 % ever use the internet .
but the government plans a major drive to promote online access for all .
" samoa is very isolated from the rest of the world , " says fuatai purcell , secretary of the national ict steering committee .
" it takes four hours to fly to new zealand , the nearest developed country .
ict will reduce the barriers of distance for us . "
she foresees the day when a computer-literate population sells samoan goods such as woven bags and polynesian prints over the internet , promoting economic growth .
the prime minister , tuilaepa sailele aiono malielegaoi , says the advantages from ict in the areas of education and health is potentially limitless .
" i have seen instances where specialists in hospitals thousands and thousands of miles away are providing the valuable direction to local technicians to perform very difficult operations , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
porn concerns in this rush to embrace new technology , there are some warning voices .

" we 're exposing ourselves to a whole lot of philosophies and ways of life , bringing in a lot of western values . "
samoan culture is centred around the traditional family unit , each headed by a matai or chief .
attendance at christian church services is high .
of particular concern to many people is internet pornography .
at one of the few private schools which provided pupils with internet access , the pcs had to be moved after it was discovered children had been accessing inappropriate websites .
the prime minister believes the benefits of the internet will far outweigh any disadvantages .
" the internet is ok so long as we impose the necessary controls to cut out pornography which would be damaging for our people , " he says .
" this aspect of control will always be with us . "
net controls the samoan government plans to update and tighten laws to penalise anyone downloading pornography .
teachers are getting to grips with the new technology but it has backed away from an earlier plan , promoted by the prime minister , to develop a national filter .
this would have required internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to attempt to block pornographic websites .
isps argued this was technically difficult and may have forced them to block legitimate websites , such as those providing health information .
" if developed countries like new zealand , australia and america are struggling with this issue it will be almost impossible for a developing country like samoa to achieve it , " says david main , technical manager for the isp called csl .

she is waiting for an internet connection to come to her village so that she can more easily contact her family in australia and new zealand .
they organise the sale of her handicrafts in overseas markets .
" at the moment a letter takes two weeks , " she says .
" with e-mail it 's instant . "
marina 's wish might now be granted as samoa has recently become one of the first island nations in the pacific to adopt a national strategy for information and communications technology -lrb- ict -rrb- .
this is a key component to unlocking overseas aid to pay for computer training , rural telecentres and e-government projects .

global market samoa is at the the heart of tropical polynesia .
it has a population of 180,000 , but only 30 % presently have access to a basic telephone .

you told us your views as part of click online 's regular feedback slot , here are some recent points you have raised while watching our programme .
first , when spencer kelly looked at the new technology of mobile phones that you can watch tv on , we asked for your opinions - and , as ever , got lots of them .
here are a couple - nicely succinct , by the way .
daniel granger , uk : " i do n't think mobile tvs will replace the television set - there have been pocket tvs for years and people did n't stop buying or using television sets . "
well , exactly .
like a lot of technologies , tv on mobile phones seems - to us at least - to be a very attractive but essentially luxury technology .
that is , something you can have if it 's affordable for you .
we ca n't see it replacing tv sets , but then the technology that is developed for the mobile phone could well end up in your home tv .
maybe we 're wrong , we 're sure you 'll e-mail us if we are .
mike mccarthy wrote from nagoya , japan : " i saw your programme about tv on mobile phones .
i live in japan and my wife just got a phone that gets both radio and tv ; the sound is tinny and really , who in their right mind wants to watch tv on a screen that size ? "
well , we think there are some that would watch tv on a mobile phone - and let 's face it , we are unlikely to be watching the widescreen version of " lawrence of arabia " on it - and as spencer pointed out the market is aimed at immediate pictures , news and sporting events - or even , of course , click online !
next , j l scotland asks : " please , could you tell me , is there a floppy disk that can hold pictures ?
i have heard of a 120 mb superdisk - does it exist ? "
the 120mb floppy , or the ls 120 as it was known , did exist around 10 years ago , and never really made much of an impact , losing out to the iomega zip drive which at the time held 100mb .
if you want to carry around pictures we would suggest a usb memory stick , which holds 1gb .
but does anyone still use floppy disks ?
and if so , what for ?
feel free to contact us .
finally , one of kate 's website recommendations earned us a rebuke from david hughes .
" why oh why did kate give the address of stumbleupon out ?
i am totally hooked and spend many hours on the site . "
what can we say david ?
keep looking and perhaps kate will give you another site to distract you away from stumbleupon .
