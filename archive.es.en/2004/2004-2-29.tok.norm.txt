the razzies , as they are affectionately known , recognise the worst films of the year .
the event is always held the day before the oscars , seeing itself as the antithesis of hollywood 's biggest backslapping night .
unsurprisingly , there is no red carpet and absolutely no stars in attendance at the ceremony as no-one wants the dishonour of winning .
in its 24-year history the only actor ever to turn up to collect an award was tom green for his howler freddy got fingered .
his brave attempt to laugh at himself won him so much credence it is a wonder why others have not followed suit .
affleck could have drawn a line under his annus horribilis by turning out but there was no sign of him or any other star , who are more accustomed to fawning rather than scathing audiences .
instead , the ceremony is more of a comedy revue show with a room full of people coming together to celebrate all that is bad in the movie world .
the biggest contenders for this year 's awards were gigli and the cat in the hat , starring mike myers in the adaptation of the classic dr seuss tale .
panned but it was gigli which walked away with six awards , including worst actor and actress for affleck and lopez .
the pair may have been an item at the time but that did not stop them from winning the worst screen couple trophy - a small raspberry-shaped statuette organisers value at less than $ 5 .
gigli sees lopez play a lesbian assassin sent to help affleck , a thug on a kidnap mission , but things go wrong when they begin to fall in love .
the film was universally panned by the critics and generally audiences stayed away in their droves despite the publicity it was receiving over the ultimately doomed relationship of its two stars - who collectively became known as bennifer .
its director martin brest also came in for a lot of stick at the razzies , with a worst director and worst screenplay titles to add to his credentials .
and of course the ignominy of the worst picture title went to gigli , which brest also had a hand in producing .
sly award but the cat in the hat did not escape totally as it was named in the new category of worst excuse for an actual movie .
sylvester stallone , once a double oscar nominee -lrb- albeit in 1977 -rrb- , hit a milestone by winning his 10th razzie award , this year for spy kids 3-d : game over .
he has a record tally of 30 nominations to his name .
girl power got the big thumbs down from the razzie voters as charlie 's angels : full throttle was named worst remake or sequel while demi moore was " crowned " worst supporting actress .
but there was no escaping the fact that gigli swept the board at this year 's event , achieving the feat of taking away an even bigger haul than last year 's big " winner " - madonna and guy ritchie 's swept away .

the razzies , as they are affectionately known , recognise the worst films of the year .
gigli became one of the most expensive flops in history the event is always held the day before the oscars , seeing itself as the antithesis of hollywood 's biggest backslapping night .
unsurprisingly , there is no red carpet and absolutely no stars in attendance at the ceremony as no-one wants the dishonour of winning .
in its 24-year history the only actor ever to turn up to collect an award was tom green for his howler freddy got fingered .
his brave attempt to laugh at himself won him so much credence it is a wonder why others have not followed suit .
affleck could have drawn a line under his annus horribilis by turning out but there was no sign of him or any other star , who are more accustomed to fawning rather than scathing audiences .
instead , the ceremony is more of a comedy revue show with a room full of people coming together to celebrate all that is bad in the movie world .
the biggest contenders for this year 's awards were gigli and the cat in the hat , starring mike myers in the adaptation of the classic dr seuss tale .
panned but it was gigli which walked away with six awards , including worst actor and actress for affleck and lopez .
the pair may have been an item at the time but that did not stop them from winning the worst screen couple trophy - a small raspberry-shaped statuette organisers value at less than $ 5 .
mike myers ' cat in the hat was also " honoured " gigli sees lopez play a lesbian assassin sent to help affleck , a thug on a kidnap mission , but things go wrong when they begin to fall in love .
the film was universally panned by the critics and generally audiences stayed away in their droves despite the publicity it was receiving over the ultimately doomed relationship of its two stars - who collectively became known as bennifer .
its director martin brest also came in for a lot of stick at the razzies , with a worst director and worst screenplay titles to add to his credentials .
and of course the ignominy of the worst picture title went to gigli , which brest also had a hand in producing .
sly award but the cat in the hat did not escape totally as it was named in the new category of worst excuse for an actual movie .
sylvester stallone , once a double oscar nominee -lrb- albeit in 1977 -rrb- , hit a milestone by winning his 10th razzie award , this year for spy kids 3-d : game over .
he has a record tally of 30 nominations to his name .
girl power got the big thumbs down from the razzie voters as charlie 's angels : full throttle was named worst remake or sequel while demi moore was " crowned " worst supporting actress .
but there was no escaping the fact that gigli swept the board at this year 's event , achieving the feat of taking away an even bigger haul than last year 's big " winner " - madonna and guy ritchie 's swept away .

a man identifying himself as abu sulaiman of the abu sayyaf group made the claim in a call to a philippine radio station .
military authorities say they are sceptical about the claim and will await the results of an investigation .
meanwhile , rescuers have boarded the wreck of the vessel for the first time .
survivors hope the smouldering 10,000-ton superferry 14 had been too hot to enter before sunday .
teams armed with axes and spotlights entered the ship through broken windows and explored the submerged command bridge but have not yet found anybody .
" we are not saying there are a lot of bodies yet , " said coastguard rear admiral arthur gosingan .
" the ferry is not totally burned .
we hope that we could still find survivors . "
relatives of the missing said they feared people were still trapped in their cabins .
there are conflicting reports about the number of people unaccounted for .
authorities say some of those listed as missing might have been picked up by fishing boats after jumping into the water to escape the flames .
one person died and more than 700 were rescued , according to the coastguard and the ferry operator .
bomb claim radio mindanao network 's programme director benji alejandro said abu sulaiman told him abu sayyaf attacked the ferry in revenge filipino muslims being hurt in philippine military operations .
the fire broke out on the same day that a court sentenced two abu sayyaf members to life imprisonment for kidnapping .
witnesses said they heard an explosion before the fire started shortly after the ferry set sail en route from manila to bacolod .
investigators have not ruled out sabotage , but are sceptical that it was a bomb attack .
" they just want to ride and hitch on the media mileage on this superferry fire , " said philippine military spokesman lt col daniel lucero .
the abu sayyaf , which mainly engages in kidnap for ransom , is one of four muslim rebel groups operating in the southern philippines .
it has been labelled a terrorist organisation by both manila and washington , and is believed by the us to have links with osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
the philippine government has deployed thousands of troops in the south in an effort to rescue the last of the hostages and eradicate the abu sayyaf .

a man identifying himself as abu sulaiman of the abu sayyaf group made the claim in a call to a philippine radio station .
military authorities say they are sceptical about the claim and will await the results of an investigation .
meanwhile , rescuers have boarded the wreck of the vessel for the first time .
survivors hope the smouldering 10,000-ton superferry 14 had been too hot to enter before sunday .
teams armed with axes and spotlights entered the ship through broken windows and explored the submerged command bridge but have not yet found anybody .
" we are not saying there are a lot of bodies yet , " said coastguard rear admiral arthur gosingan .
" the ferry is not totally burned .
we hope that we could still find survivors . "
relatives of the missing said they feared people were still trapped in their cabins .
there are conflicting reports about the number of people unaccounted for .
authorities say some of those listed as missing might have been picked up by fishing boats after jumping into the water to escape the flames .
one person died and more than 700 were rescued , according to the coastguard and the ferry operator .
bomb claim radio mindanao network 's programme director benji alejandro said abu sulaiman told him abu sayyaf attacked the ferry in revenge filipino muslims being hurt in philippine military operations .
the fire broke out on the same day that a court sentenced two abu sayyaf members to life imprisonment for kidnapping .
witnesses said they heard an explosion before the fire started shortly after the ferry set sail en route from manila to bacolod .
investigators have not ruled out sabotage , but are sceptical that it was a bomb attack .
" they just want to ride and hitch on the media mileage on this superferry fire , " said philippine military spokesman lt col daniel lucero .
the abu sayyaf , which mainly engages in kidnap for ransom , is one of four muslim rebel groups operating in the southern philippines .
it has been labelled a terrorist organisation by both manila and washington , and is believed by the us to have links with osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
the philippine government has deployed thousands of troops in the south in an effort to rescue the last of the hostages and eradicate the abu sayyaf .

bbc clickonline 's spencer kelly looks at how you can speed up your connection .
get more from your old dial-up modem the dial-up modem used to be the symbol of the hi-tech home user .
for millions of computer users , it meant access to the world wide web , and all the information you could ever want .
but gone are the days when a good bit of text was all we wanted to download .
a picture may be worth a thousand words , but it is also a lot of data .
so how do you speed up those old modems ?
ads for internet boost services scream out loud from their banners , claims of speed boosts of 200 % or 300 % are common .
most will tweak the system settings , fine-tuning a computer , something that would otherwise need expert knowledge , but which is not impossible to do on your own .
some claim to do more than that , to actually compress the data you are trying to download , thus reducing the amount your modem has to cope with in the first place .
compressed web this is not at all a new concept , well-known programs like winzip have been compressing files for years .
connection speed tips keep the cable short and clear make enough room in the memory cache avoid traffic , go online at off-peak times turn off your graphics update your modem driver but new products like onspeed claim to offer much better compression .
they do it by breaking a web page into its constituent parts .
pictures and graphics are compressed using one technique , while text is handled by another specially suited technique .
but pictures and music are already stored in a compressed format on the internet , can such programs really claim to compress them further without losing quality ?
" when we compress an image some of the content does get lost , and it looks a bit fuzzy , but you can control that with our software , " said jonty slater of onspeed .
" you can say that you want it almost exactly as you would via the web page , or you can say i do n't really care , i want more speed , i just want an idea of what the image looks like .
onspeed also offers the option of downloading a page in its full quality , by manually disabling the compression .
computer bottlenecks critics are not convinced that accelerator programs alone will cure a slow modem .
" undoubtedly it will deliver some kind of improvement , whether it 's an improvement you 'll notice is another matter , " said andrew charlesworth , editor of pc advisor magazine .
" one of the really simple ways of increasing speed is to turn off the graphics in your browser .
this sounds quite mad because it means all you will get is the text andrew charlesworth , pc advisor " you really need to address the whole thing from end to end .
there is no silver bullet , no one solution that will make your modem work more quickly . "
before trying compression , there are some other tricks you might like to try .
start with the cable .
keep it as short as possible to reduce any signal degradation .
and while you are about it , try unplugging anything else that shares the line .
" there will be various bottlenecks within your computer system , and one of those might be the amount of system memory , " said mr charlesworth .
" the memory is used to cache the pages , to store them temporarily , so that when you click on forward or back buttons on the browser they come up instantly .
if they 've dropped out of the cache because it is n't big enough , because you 've not got enough memory , then the machine has to go and get them from the website again . "
you have control over the amount of hard disk space given over to this kind of caching .
the more there is , the less work your modem will have to do .
off-peak surfing even if everything is running fine at your end , general internet traffic may clog up the browsing experience .
the us in particular has an awful lot of users , so if you want a faster service , go online when america is asleep .
" one of the really simple ways of increasing speed is to turn off the graphics in your browser , " said mr charlesworth .
" this sounds quite mad because it means all you will get is the text .
" the page that you are asking your computer to download comes down much more quickly because it has not just the pictures stripped out , but all those little animated graphics , the gifs , which take up a huge amount of bandwidth when they 're loading . "
different modems need different commands to control them , and this is handled by the modem 's driver .
every so often these driver programs are updated with better and faster technology .
so find out who makes your modem , and look for a new version to download .
microsoft 's windows update page is a good place to start .

" one of the really simple ways of increasing speed is to turn off the graphics in your browser , " said mr charlesworth .
" this sounds quite mad because it means all you will get is the text .
" the page that you are asking your computer to download comes down much more quickly because it has not just the pictures stripped out , but all those little animated graphics , the gifs , which take up a huge amount of bandwidth when they 're loading . "
different modems need different commands to control them , and this is handled by the modem 's driver .
every so often these driver programs are updated with better and faster technology .
so find out who makes your modem , and look for a new version to download .
microsoft 's windows update page is a good place to start .
but at the end of the day , there is only so much that can be done to speed up what is becoming an archaic way of getting online .

susan matheson , chief executive of sacro , said short sentences were counterproductive and not in the public interest .
statistics show there are about 7,000 people in scotland 's jails and 80 % of them will serve six months or less .
ms matheson said sheriffs should use more community disposals .
she said sending people to prison to serve short sentences was " a waste of time , money and effort " .
of those sentenced to six months or less , 51 % were back behind bars within six months of being released and 75 % were back in jail within a year , she said .
it will support public safety if we actually reduce prison numbers and take out those people who do n't actually need to be in prison alec spencer sps director of rehabilitation " we 're not actually achieving anything with these short sentences , " she said .
" if we want to achieve public safety then we need to work with people to change their attitudes and behaviour to put right the things in their lives that caused them to offend in the first place .
" nowadays , that is usually drug and alcohol abuse . "
she said the solution was for sheriffs to use community disposals rather than short prison sentences .
the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- said it was in favour of easing the prison population and believed a policy change may be needed .
alec spencer , the sps ' director of rehabilitation , said : " it will support public safety if we actually reduce prison numbers and take out those people who do n't actually need to be in prison .
" then focus on serious offenders and allow those who are not a danger to the public to stay outside in the community .
" scotland has quite a punitive tradition and we probably think it 's best if someone commits an offence then we should throw the book at them and lock them up .
" i do n't think that 's necessarily the best course of action . "
