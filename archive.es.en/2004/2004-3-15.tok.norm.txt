fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .

a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .

antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .

microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain to withdraw troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists campaigned against spain 's support for the iraq war .
fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .
the pp will remain the largest single party in the upper house or senate making it difficult for a socialist government to pass legislation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bloodied but unbowed , spain goes to the polls the ruling popular party faces opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .

barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc incoming spanish pm hints u-turn on eu constitution the new socialist-led government in spain has indicated an immediate softening of madrid 's tough stance on the draft european constitution .
speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain 's socialists win elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain says no to terrorism anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .
led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .

the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .

a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .
the pp will remain the largest single party in the upper house or senate making it difficult for a socialist government to pass legislation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bloodied but unbowed , spain goes to the polls the ruling popular party faces opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc incoming spanish pm hints u-turn on eu constitution the new socialist-led government in spain has indicated an immediate softening of madrid 's tough stance on the draft european constitution .
speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .

" it 's incomprehensible that a neighboring country and close friend would not inform us of such a measure , " swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey told the bern newspaper der bund .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said he ensured his colleague that the strengthened controls were unrelated to difficult negotiations between the european union and switzerland that would bring the non-eu state into the schengen agreement , which effectively eliminates borders between european countries .
in the wake of terror attacks in spain , germany has increased security on its non-eu borders , contributing to traffic jams in switzerland reaching up dozens of kilometers in length . more briefs 15.03.2004 -pipe- investigation of islamic extremists with ties to bonn school continues 15.03.2004 -pipe- jewish group accuses irish museum of holding stolen art 15.03.2004 -pipe- barenboim awarded medal for mideast peace project 12.03.2004 -pipe- german bobsledder dies during training 12.03.2004 -pipe- germany , poland work to resolve eu constitution dispute 12.03.2004 -pipe- germany participates in anti-terror rally 11.03.2004 -pipe- german official criticizes u.s. demands for passenger data 11.03.2004 -pipe- germany 's soccer reputation scarred radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.03.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany faces eu ultimatum over vw law germany is facing increasing pressure from the european commission to revoke the controversial law that protects german car manufacturer volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover , german magazine focus reported on sunday .
the german government is expecting an ultimatum from eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein to scrap the so-called " vw law " by the end of the month , the magazine said , citing sources close to the commissioner .

russian president vladimir putin rejected international criticism of his overwhelming election victory on sunday and pledged to build democracy in his country even as others allege it is eroding . looking calm and collected in the wee hours of monday morning , russian president vladimir putin thanked his supporters for voting him into a second term .
wearing a black turtleneck sweater and black coat , the russian leader promised to continue the economic growth that has been a hallmark of his first term in office while continuing to expand democracy in the country .
but the russian leader also seemed to take great pains to calm international fears that democracy in russia is eroding under his control , including criticism by united states secretary of state colin powell and national security advisor condoleeza rice that putin 's political opponents had not been given equal access to the media , which provided a flood of positive coverage for the incumbent candidate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " i have some concerns , but i do n't think democracy is in trouble in russia , " powell said on the u.s. cable channel fox news on sunday .
" but russians have to understand that to have full democracy of the kind that the international community will recognize , you 've got to let candidates have all access to the media that the president has .
you 've got to make sure people are not in any way kept from participating in the open , full democratic process .
we are concerned about the way this election is being held , and the way the election for the duma , their parliament , was held not too long ago . "
as he declared victory on monday morning , putin categorically rejected washington 's criticism .
" i believe nobody has the right to think that if they criticize others , that they should n't be criticized themselves , " putin said at a news conference .
" in many so-called developed democracies there are also many problems with their own democratic and voting procedures .
and we , nearly four years ago , saw in amazement how the american system voting system suffered glitches . "
criticism from oecd the most direct criticism of russian elections came on monday from the organization for security and cooperation , which dispatched close to 340 election monitors across the country to observe the poll .
julian peel-yates , who headed the oecd delegation said monday that russia had failed to adhere to the necessary standards for a " healthy democratic " process in the run-up to the election , adding that there had neither been a political debate nor a " true pluralism . "
peel-yates accused the state-run media of violating important rules requiring the equal treatment of candidates .
still , peel-yates said the actually polling on sunday was well-organized .
a second election watchdog group organized by the council of europe , of which russia is a member , drew similar conclusions .
germany 's rudolf bindig , who led the delegation , said there appeared to be no wrongdoing during the vote .
election day had been quiet and the " technical procedures in at polling stations were executed in an orderly manner , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
media bias though bindig gave the thumbs up for clean russian elections , he joined the oecd in criticizing the russian media for what he described as bias towards putin during the presidential campaign .
that was a common concern among russia ’ s liberal democrats and international observers in the run-up to sunday ’ s vote .
the kremlin controls the nation-wide television stations where most russians get their news .
glowing reports of putin usually lead the nightly news with opposition candidates often regulated to the less watched morning hours or simply not appearing on the news at all .
putin ’ s forces also control the russian parliament and with a government reshuffle in the pre-election campaign , they now have a firm grip on the cabinet as well .
this and the media control has led to fears that russia is returning to its soviet-era roots of authoritarianism .
but putin ’ s high numbers also reflect a genuine like of the president among russia ’ s 110 million voters .
he is credited with bringing stability to the country after years of chaos under former president boris yeltsin .
putin : i will uphold democracy on monday , putin also pledged to protect russia ’ s fragile democracy and the multi-party system .
he vowed to uphold media freedoms in the country .
" i promise you that all democratic gains of our people will without any doubt be upheld and guaranteed , " he said .
with considerable recent debate over russia 's democratic difficiencies , many groups feared it would be difficult to generate a fair vote on sunday .
but at least one european election watchdog said there appeared to be no problems with the russian poll . landslide win that political track record appeared to pay off on sunday , with putin scoring a landslide victory and garnering 71.2 percent of the vote according to official preliminary results released by russia 's central election committee on monday .
voter turnout of 64.3 percent was also significantly higher than the 52.5 percent of the population who turned out for the last presidential election in 2000 .

russian president vladimir putin rejected international criticism of his overwhelming election victory on sunday and pledged to build democracy in his country even as others allege it is eroding . looking calm and collected in the wee hours of monday morning , russian president vladimir putin thanked his supporters for voting him into a second term .
wearing a black turtleneck sweater and black coat , the russian leader promised to continue the economic growth that has been a hallmark of his first term in office while continuing to expand democracy in the country .
but the russian leader also seemed to take great pains to calm international fears that democracy in russia is eroding under his control , including criticism by united states secretary of state colin powell and national security advisor condoleeza rice that putin 's political opponents had not been given equal access to the media , which provided a flood of positive coverage for the incumbent candidate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " i have some concerns , but i do n't think democracy is in trouble in russia , " powell said on the u.s. cable channel fox news on sunday .
" but russians have to understand that to have full democracy of the kind that the international community will recognize , you 've got to let candidates have all access to the media that the president has .
you 've got to make sure people are not in any way kept from participating in the open , full democratic process .
we are concerned about the way this election is being held , and the way the election for the duma , their parliament , was held not too long ago . "
as he declared victory on monday morning , putin categorically rejected washington 's criticism .
" i believe nobody has the right to think that if they criticize others , that they should n't be criticized themselves , " putin said at a news conference .
" in many so-called developed democracies there are also many problems with their own democratic and voting procedures .
and we , nearly four years ago , saw in amazement how the american system voting system suffered glitches . "
criticism from oecd the most direct criticism of russian elections came on monday from the organization for security and cooperation , which dispatched close to 340 election monitors across the country to observe the poll .
julian peel-yates , who headed the oecd delegation said monday that russia had failed to adhere to the necessary standards for a " healthy democratic " process in the run-up to the election , adding that there had neither been a political debate nor a " true pluralism . "
peel-yates accused the state-run media of violating important rules requiring the equal treatment of candidates .
still , peel-yates said the actually polling on sunday was well-organized .
a second election watchdog group organized by the council of europe , of which russia is a member , drew similar conclusions .
germany 's rudolf bindig , who led the delegation , said there appeared to be no wrongdoing during the vote .
election day had been quiet and the " technical procedures in at polling stations were executed in an orderly manner , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
media bias though bindig gave the thumbs up for clean russian elections , he joined the oecd in criticizing the russian media for what he described as bias towards putin during the presidential campaign .
that was a common concern among russia ’ s liberal democrats and international observers in the run-up to sunday ’ s vote .
the kremlin controls the nation-wide television stations where most russians get their news .
glowing reports of putin usually lead the nightly news with opposition candidates often regulated to the less watched morning hours or simply not appearing on the news at all .
putin ’ s forces also control the russian parliament and with a government reshuffle in the pre-election campaign , they now have a firm grip on the cabinet as well .
this and the media control has led to fears that russia is returning to its soviet-era roots of authoritarianism .
but putin ’ s high numbers also reflect a genuine like of the president among russia ’ s 110 million voters .
he is credited with bringing stability to the country after years of chaos under former president boris yeltsin .
putin : i will uphold democracy on monday , putin also pledged to protect russia ’ s fragile democracy and the multi-party system .
he vowed to uphold media freedoms in the country .
" i promise you that all democratic gains of our people will without any doubt be upheld and guaranteed , " he said .
with considerable recent debate over russia 's democratic difficiencies , many groups feared it would be difficult to generate a fair vote on sunday .
but at least one european election watchdog said there appeared to be no problems with the russian poll . landslide win that political track record appeared to pay off on sunday , with putin scoring a landslide victory and garnering 71.2 percent of the vote according to official preliminary results released by russia 's central election committee on monday .
voter turnout of 64.3 percent was also significantly higher than the 52.5 percent of the population who turned out for the last presidential election in 2000 .

" in many so-called developed democracies there are also many problems with their own democratic and voting procedures .
and we , nearly four years ago , saw in amazement how the american system voting system suffered glitches . "
criticism from oecd the most direct criticism of russian elections came on monday from the organization for security and cooperation , which dispatched close to 340 election monitors across the country to observe the poll .
julian peel-yates , who headed the oecd delegation said monday that russia had failed to adhere to the necessary standards for a " healthy democratic " process in the run-up to the election , adding that there had neither been a political debate nor a " true pluralism . "
peel-yates accused the state-run media of violating important rules requiring the equal treatment of candidates .
still , peel-yates said the actually polling on sunday was well-organized .
a second election watchdog group organized by the council of europe , of which russia is a member , drew similar conclusions .
germany 's rudolf bindig , who led the delegation , said there appeared to be no wrongdoing during the vote .
election day had been quiet and the " technical procedures in at polling stations were executed in an orderly manner , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
media bias though bindig gave the thumbs up for clean russian elections , he joined the oecd in criticizing the russian media for what he described as bias towards putin during the presidential campaign .
that was a common concern among russia ’ s liberal democrats and international observers in the run-up to sunday ’ s vote .
the kremlin controls the nation-wide television stations where most russians get their news .
glowing reports of putin usually lead the nightly news with opposition candidates often regulated to the less watched morning hours or simply not appearing on the news at all .
putin ’ s forces also control the russian parliament and with a government reshuffle in the pre-election campaign , they now have a firm grip on the cabinet as well .
this and the media control has led to fears that russia is returning to its soviet-era roots of authoritarianism .
but putin ’ s high numbers also reflect a genuine like of the president among russia ’ s 110 million voters .
he is credited with bringing stability to the country after years of chaos under former president boris yeltsin .
putin : i will uphold democracy on monday , putin also pledged to protect russia ’ s fragile democracy and the multi-party system .
he vowed to uphold media freedoms in the country .
" i promise you that all democratic gains of our people will without any doubt be upheld and guaranteed , " he said .
with considerable recent debate over russia 's democratic difficiencies , many groups feared it would be difficult to generate a fair vote on sunday .
but at least one european election watchdog said there appeared to be no problems with the russian poll . landslide win that political track record appeared to pay off on sunday , with putin scoring a landslide victory and garnering 71.2 percent of the vote according to official preliminary results released by russia 's central election committee on monday .
voter turnout of 64.3 percent was also significantly higher than the 52.5 percent of the population who turned out for the last presidential election in 2000 .
only one of the other five candidates in the race , communist nikolai kharitonov , managed to clear double digits .
the other competitors failed to reach five percent . dw staff with reporting by rebecca santana -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian election or referendum ?

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .

polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .
the pp will remain the largest single party in the upper house or senate making it difficult for a socialist government to pass legislation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bloodied but unbowed , spain goes to the polls the ruling popular party faces opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks .

in an interview with the sunday edition of the german frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , eichel said that while exports , which are the cornerstone of germany 's economy , were holding up well despite the strength of the euro against the dollar , domestic demand was proving problematic for the government .
data published by the federal statistics office showed that germany 's exports continued to rise in the early part of the year - € 55.7 billion -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- worth of goods in january , up from € 54.5 billion the month before .
meanwhile , one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , diw , said last week that it was reducing its forecast for growth of german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the first three months of this year to just 0.1 percent from its previous prediction of 0.4 percent . more briefs 15.03.2004 -pipe- germany faces eu ultimatum over vw law 15.03.2004 -pipe- european leaders call for reduction of business restrictions 12.03.2004 -pipe- social democrats to buy stake in struggling paper 12.03.2004 -pipe- travel industry does n't expect falloff after madrid 12.03.2004 -pipe- low fares boost frankfurt airport passenger numbers 11.03.2004 -pipe- risks remain for german economy 11.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn € 470 million in the red in 2003 11.03.2004 -pipe- bmw reports lower profits radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with radio tok fm , polish deputy prime minister jozef oleksy on friday hinted there is a possibility for a compromise based on the proposed " double-majority " voting system .
the new system , which would see a minimum number of member states representing a minimum amount of the eu ’ s population needed to see a decision taken , was the main reason why talks collapsed on the constitution last december .
the system is strongly supported by germany , the country with the biggest population in the eu .
oleksy denied the ‘ nice or die ’ level of debate in the constitution was the official stance of the government in warsaw – under the nice treaty , poland has a relatively beneficial vote weighting .
however , the deputy prime minister would not go further than that .
he insisted that poland has not officially changed its position to wholehearted support for the double majority system .
" we maintain for now the position that was presented in brussels ; openness for a compromise does not yet mean the method has been chosen , " oleksy said.meanwhile , at a press conference in dublin today , irish prime minister and current head of the eu bertie ahern underlined his support for the new voting system .

in an interview with radio tok fm , polish deputy prime minister jozef oleksy on friday hinted there is a possibility for a compromise based on the proposed " double-majority " voting system .
the new system , which would see a minimum number of member states representing a minimum amount of the eu ’ s population needed to see a decision taken , was the main reason why talks collapsed on the constitution last december .
the system is strongly supported by germany , the country with the biggest population in the eu .
oleksy denied the ‘ nice or die ’ level of debate in the constitution was the official stance of the government in warsaw – under the nice treaty , poland has a relatively beneficial vote weighting .
however , the deputy prime minister would not go further than that .
he insisted that poland has not officially changed its position to wholehearted support for the double majority system .
" we maintain for now the position that was presented in brussels ; openness for a compromise does not yet mean the method has been chosen , " oleksy said.meanwhile , at a press conference in dublin today , irish prime minister and current head of the eu bertie ahern underlined his support for the new voting system .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain 's socialists win elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain says no to terrorism anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .
led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .
the pp will remain the largest single party in the upper house or senate making it difficult for a socialist government to pass legislation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bloodied but unbowed , spain goes to the polls the ruling popular party faces opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .

a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain to withdraw troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists campaigned against spain 's support for the iraq war .
fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .

" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "

" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain 's socialists win elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain says no to terrorism anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .
led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 15.03.2004 eu closes in on microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft might soon have to change its european business practices .
european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .

barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "
a new iraq policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- 43 -rrb- and his wife sonsoles the 43-year-old zapatero , who has risen to popularity by criticizing outgoing premier aznar 's support for the u.s. policy in iraq and threatening to pull out the 1,300 spanish troops stationed in the country once elected , said his administration would be marked by dialogue and transparency .
" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .
with 164 seats in the lower house of parliament , 12 short of those needed for an absolute majority , the socialists will need to forge alliances with smaller regional parties or left-wing allies in order to govern .
the pp will remain the largest single party in the upper house or senate making it difficult for a socialist government to pass legislation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bloodied but unbowed , spain goes to the polls the ruling popular party faces opposition and protest in the wake of thursday 's terror attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.03.2004 spain to withdraw troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's socialists campaigned against spain 's support for the iraq war .
fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's socialists win elections anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .
" the idea that , somehow , there is some exemption certificate for this war against terrorism is utter nonsense .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .
gathering in front of the popular party 's office , the protestors chanted " liar " and held up banners demanding , " we want the truth . "

" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .
" the government has paid the price for its involvement in iraq , for aznar 's relationship with bush and tony blair .
the vote has been a reaction to this , " carlos berzosa , rector of madrid 's complutense university , told reuters news service .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq . less than 24 hours after being elected the country 's next prime minister , zapatero made good on his campaign promise to bring home spanish troops stationed in iraq .
the deployment of some 1,300 soldiers as part of the u.s.-led war in iraq had been extremely unpopular .
polls conducted in the country last february showed that 90 percent of the population was against outgoing premier jose maria aznar 's support for the united state 's foreign policy .
the newly elected socialist leader had campaigned on a policy to withdraw the troops from iraq .
his party topped the polls in sunday 's elections after wide-spread frustration with the government 's withholding of information connected to thursday 's bombings in madrid caused voters to turn away from aznar 's ruling popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
speaking to cadena ser radio , zapatero called the iraq war a disaster .
" the war has been a disaster , the occupation continues to be a disaster , it has only generated violence , " he said monday morning .
zapatero said once he cobbles together his coalition and is officially installed as prime minister , he will move to bring the troops home if there is no change in iraq by the june 30 deadline for transfer of sovereignty from the u.s.-backed authority .
" the spanish troops which are in iraq will be returning home , " he said in his first post-election interview .
punishment for the popular party bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's premier minister jose maria aznar spain 's leading newspaper el mundo came down hard on the outgoing government for entering the iraq conflict and playing down evidence of al qaeda 's connection to thursday 's bombings which killed 200 .
" spain punishes the pp and places it 's confidence in zapatero , " it 's monday headline blasted .
sunday 's election , which gave the socialists a surprising 42.6 percent of the vote compared to the pp 's 37.6 percent , was the first time in the country 's modern democratic history that a party lost power after holding an absolute majority .
an international message ?
internationally , the defeat of aznar 's party is a setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq campaign .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
in great britain , prime minister tony blair continues to be dogged by questions about the war 's legality and the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction - the primary reason cited by downing street for its intervention .
the loss of britain 's main ally in europe could further undermine blair 's standing back home .
bush and blair " need to engage in some self-criticism " on their decision to launch a war against iraq , zapatero said monday .
but british foreign secretary jack straw played down any negative consequences for the two countries ties in europe , recalling that the spanish socialists and blair 's labor party have " very good fraternal relations . "
he also dismissed the suggestion that spain , or any other nation , could become immune from terrorist attacks by opposing the iraq war .
" nobody , nobody , nobody should believe that somehow we can opt out of the war against islamic terrorism , " he said .

led by jose luis rodriguez zapatero , the party vows to focus on fighting terrorism . " my immediate priority will be to fight all forms of terrorism , " a victorious zapatero announced sunday evening after it became clear his party of socialists had ousted the conservative popular party of prime minister jose maria aznar .
up until the bombings , the pp looked almost certain to win a third consecutive term in power .
but the surprise win by the socialists , who garnered 43 percent of the votes compared to 38 percent for the popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , was seen by many as a reaction to the government 's information policy after the madrid attacks which killed 200 people and wounded 1,500 and to the country 's continued involvement in iraq .
questioning government information immediately after the bombings on commuter trains , aznar 's party pointed fingers at the basque separatist group eta and until late saturday evening continued to view the regional terrorist group as the chief suspect , despite growing evidence that islamic extremists may have been involved .
only hours before polling began on sunday , the government revealed it had a videotape , purportedly from osama bin laden 's al qaeda , saying the attacks were in retaliation for spain 's support for the u.s.-led war on iraq .
the earlier discovery of a van with detonators and a tape in arabic reciting koran verses as well as the arrest of three moroccans and two indians caused many spaniards to question the government 's case .
on the eve of election thousands took to the streets in madrid and other large cities protesting the government 's withholding of information for the sake of winning votes .

" today spaniards have spoken , " he said triumphantly .
" the people wanted a government of change . "
zapatero , who has never held office , pledged to enact social reform and " move spain to the front line of european construction . "
many , however , see in him the leader who can turn around spain 's unpopular foreign policy in iraq .
according to polls , some 90 percent of spaniards opposed aznar 's decision to join the u.s. led coalition to topple saddam hussein and want to see a return of spanish troops .
if there is no change in the war-torn country by june 30 , the date the united states has promised to transfer sovereignty to a provisional government , spain 's prime minister-elect said he would pull spanish soldiers out of iraq .
" the war on iraq was a disaster , the occupation of iraq is a disaster , " zapatero said on cadena ser radio on monday .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .
unlike in the united states , where a judge makes the initial decision , in europe the eu commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu gives microsoft ultimatum the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion .

european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position . the european union on monday came one step closer to punishing software giant microsoft for alleged abuses of its dominant market position .
in a closed-door session , representatives from the 15 member states agreed to support the commission 's antitrust office in a draft ruling against microsoft corporation that sources say could slap up to $ 3 billion in fines on the company and force it to change the way it sells its ubiquitous windows operating system in europe .
" the member states have unanimously backed the commission 's draft decision , " amelia torres , spokeswoman for eu competition commissioner mario monti , told reporters shortly after noon .
the announcement comes ahead of a final verdict scheduled for next week .
barring a last-minute settlement , the eu 's executive body is expected to set the size of the fine to be levied against the world 's biggest software company and the changes required of its business practices .
the decision is then endorsed by an advisory panel - scheduled to meet on march 22 - and after that competition commissioner mario monti will announce what is sure to be the most important ruling of his five-year term .
clock ticks for microsoft meanwhile , microsoft 's legal team is busy lobbying brussels in hopes of averting a full-blown conflict .
much is at stake for the u.s.-based company .
a negative verdict from the eu would be the biggest setback for microsoft since a u.s. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving internet browsers in 2000 .
a year later the company managed to hammer out a settlement with the bush administration that allowed it to hold on to its internet explorer browser with some conditions .
antitrust experts in europe say monday 's draft ruling similarly finds microsft abused its windows dominance to gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
the eu wants to force the company to offer computer manufacturers a version of windows without its own pre-installed audio-visual media player to give rivals like realnetworks inc. a fair chance at landing on consumer desktops .
it also calls on microsoft to release more basic server codes for windows to improve " interoperability " with competing networking software made by sun microsystems and others .
commission seeks remedies although the eu could seek fines totaling hundreds of millions in euros , monti has said he is primarily interested in " market remedies " to redress the unbalanced effects of microsoft 's domination in the pc software market .
the commission plans to give microsoft a deadline to change its business practices or face additional action .
microsoft 's first move after the ruling is announced next week will almost certainly be to ask the european court of justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal , but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

speaking on monday to the radio station cadena ser , prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero said he wants to " speed up " negotiations on the constitution .
zapatero said he believes europe can quickly come to an agreement on a " sensible power balance " for the enlarged eu .
describing the europe union as the natural platform for spanish foreign policy , zapatero signaled a dramatic shift in policy from the aznar administration , which was voted out of power on sunday .
for the past six months , spain , along with poland , has been holding out against a proposed new system of voting weights in the constitution .
negotiations over the draft text collapsed in december .
the new system proposes that decisions be taken on the basis of a double majority of both eu population -lrb- 60 percent -rrb- and member states -lrb- 50 percent -rrb- - and would leave both madrid and warsaw relatively less better off than they are now .

barbarella - buxom and barely clad - has returned to save the oppressed from the evil black queen .
a stage version in vienna of the ' 60s cult film starring jane fonda is introducing a new generation to space kitsch . in the film , the high camp got going during the opening credits .
barbarella , space vixen extraordinaire , teases herself out of her space suit in zero gravity , accompanied by a trippy sixties soundtrack . it only gets better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress jane fonda in the original " barbarella " born originally in a french comic strip in 1962 , the celluloid barbarella , played by a 31-year-old fonda -lrb- photo -rrb- , embarks on a 41st century crusade to save the universe from the evil of renegade scientist dr. duran duran -lrb- who presumably gave the pop group its name -rrb- , while facing kink-laced tortures that generally involved the removal of several parts of her already barely-there outfits . there were the budgies that almost pecked her to death , the lake of pure evil that looks suspiciously like a lava lamp , and the sensual machine , a piano-like contraption that kills by inducing an endless chain of orgasms .
barbarella survives them all ; she actually looks like she does n't mind some of her torments that much . now , 35 years later , the sex-laced sci-fi tale has hit the vienna stage .
the raimund theater has mounted a retelling , which opened last week , bringing back the heaving busoms , the blond locks , and the skin-tight costumes of the original .
billed as the " sexy space musical , " barbarella illustrates that the camp aesthetic has n't changed all that much in more than three decades . virtual sex the story has , though , been slightly altered in keeping with the times . barbarella , played by austrian actress nina proll , has lost her crew to virtual reality , and ca n't get them back .
she embarks on a rescue mission and lets herself be transported to the virtual planet of sogo , a place teeming with dangers and muscled biceps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva maria marold is the black queen .
sogo is ruled by the evil black queen -lrb- photo -rrb- , played with grimacing bravura by eva maria marold .
barbarella must find a way to unseat her antagonist , looking very much the dominatrix in her thigh-high black boots . the blonde heroine undergoes various sexcapades to accomplish her mission - sleeping with a robot to get information , cozying up close to her muscular guardian angel , then even engaging in a tryst with the queen herself . the producers have thrown in something for just about everyone 's taste . big names the production has some well-known figures behind it .
the elaborate , creative - and often scanty - costumes were designed by david dalrymple and patricia field , who outfit the clotheshorses on the hit u.s. television show " sex and the city . "
stage designer mark fisher , who has created backdrops for rolling stones concerts , creates an on-stage world that sparkles and glitters as camp sci-fi should .
dave stewart , of the 80 's pop group eurhythmics , composed the score . despite the glitz and glam though , some critics wonder if this production will live beyond the initial flash from all the sequined lycra on stage .
some have faulted american director and choreographer kim duddy , who staged a successful production of hair , for playing it too straight , and not taking advantage of the material to create a candy-colored parody of utopian visions from the sixties , or staging a acid-fueled send-up of an age of innocence that has long-since passed . but perhaps barbarella 's shiny surfaces are all it needs , and delving deeper would just mar its finish .
after all , it offers theater goers a near overdose of sexed-up eye candy topped with a liberal sprinkling of over-the-top camp .

empty bottles and newspapers have their place , tossed into big bright bags , destined for a new recycled life .
but what about the office pc ?
its working life can be even shorter than the winner of a reality tv singing contest .
after about three years plugs are pulled out from crumb-filled keyboards and computer stacks and they disappear in a puff of megabytes .
once a state-of-the-art pentium princess , now a relic before its time , your pc is then unceremoniously dumped in favour of a faster , sexier model .
next thing you know to your faithful but redundant old dell is left to rot with a pile of computer mice and old mobile phones , leaking lead and other hazardous waste into landfill sites .
e-waste discarded computers and phones mean more environmental headaches .
namely , the growing problem of e-waste .
around 1.5m pcs end up on landfill sites across the uk every year - that 's roughly 125,000 tonnes of it equipment .
most children in developing nations have never touched a computer these are nearly always perfectly functioning , user friendly , well kept machines .
but with technology racing ever faster , the next best thing can become last year 's fashion within the bat of an eyelid or the click of a mouse .
yet schools and small businesses in poorer countries are crying out for them .
one charity , digital links , is making use of these wasted resources by rescuing unwanted pcs and transporting them to countries desperately in need of high-tech help but equally desperately short of cash .
digital links international has provided more than 3,000 computers at low-cost to 12 countries , including kenya , uganda , senegal , gambia , tanzania and armenia .
in many of these developing countries over 95 % of children leave school without ever having touched a computer .
new lease of life digital links takes used pentium computers from companies and cleans them up , wiping out hard drives to ministry of defence standards ready to be shipped in containers to whichever country needs them .
the donating company is freed from the worry of sensitive data and software getting into the wrong hands and bypasses the costs of recycling and storage .
the hardware is the easiest part .
the expertise , the maintenance , training teachers and technicians in schools is the tough part david sogan , chief executive digital links the refurbished computer provides " 90 % of the functionality of new computer equipment for as little as 10 % of the cost " , digital links claims .
buying a computer is the easy part , says founder david sogan .
the more expensive part is installing it , networking it and keeping it running properly .
but the effect of putting an internet enabled computer into a classroom where there are no textbooks and where even access to tv or newspapers is limited is " quite simply transformational " .
high-tech missionary the impact of the internet on local economies is easy to imagine and full back up support is on hand .
deprived youngsters are " transformed " by computer access aside from procurement and delivery , ' aftercare ' is provided with qualified it volunteers sent out like internet missionaries to help schools , hospitals and small firms set up their computer systems .
donating companies , which currently include barclays , reuters , bupa and centrica , can even keep track on where their equipment ends up , whether it be a school , university , charity , community group or small enterprise .
and rather than shifting a potential environmental hazard to another country , digital links plans to develop systems for the safe disposal of toxic waste for the computers it exports .
its first recycling programme begins early next year in kenya .
local rivalry but do local computer suppliers in poorer countries feel threatened by this foreign influx ?
there is a often flourishing second hand computer market locally , mr sogan admitted , but without the technical support to keep systems running .
" but we do n't just supply computers we try to set up systems to deploy them into , " he told bbc news online .
in many countries it 's not a question of computers , it 's actually a question of pens and paper and getting the kids into school actionaid " the hardware is the easiest part .
the expertise , the maintenance , training teachers and technicians in schools is the tough part .
" it 's easy to get a pc on your desk , but getting the thing running is when things can get tricky . "
back to basics however , many rural areas in developing countries do not have electricity to light a room let alone get a computer up and running .
" in many countries it 's not a question of computers , it 's actually a question of pens and paper and getting the kids into school , " said a spokeswoman for overseas charity group actionaid told bbc news online .
low cost computers are distributed to schools and even churches " if you go to a school in a rural area , way out in the bush , you 're not going to be hooked up to electricity . "
actionaid said the technical revolution could not be ignored , but should go done hand in hand with making sure the basics , such as books , paper and pens are provided too .
however , the benefits of internet access speak for themselves , as david sogan recounts : " on a trip i made to the gambia last year i was amazed to see on of the roadside carpenters was doing a roaring trade making a range of contemporary swedish style furniture , " he said .
" when i asked him where he got the idea , you 've guessed it , he told me he 'd seen it on the ikea website . "

the views of local people on plans to make maternity services at neath port talbot hospital midwife-run , rather than supervised by consultants and doctors , have been invited before a final decision is reached .
the consultation period is now due to end , with the neath port talbot local health board due to meet on 1 april to make a final decision on the unit 's future .
on friday , a group of mothers held a protest at the hospital over what they say is a downgrading of services .
under the proposals , which were recommended by a review group set up by the health board in december , maternity services will be provided by midwives , with non-routine and emergency cases transferred to consultant-led units at hospitals in bridgend and swansea .
there have been protests against the maternity unit plans the £ 64m hospital , which opened last november , at baglan , port talbot , has been unable to recruit enough medical staff for the maternity unit , leading to the recommendation to move to a midwife-led facility .
the health board has denied that a midwife-led unit would amount to a downgrading of maternity care in neath port talbot .
but the recommendations have led to protests from people living locally , who object to some mothers from the area having to travel to swansea or bridgend to give birth .
a 5,000-signature petition has been collected against the proposals .
if the proposal is finally adopted , following the public consultation , the new service could be up and running by april .

the views of local people on plans to make maternity services at neath port talbot hospital midwife-run , rather than supervised by consultants and doctors , have been invited before a final decision is reached .
the consultation period is now due to end , with the neath port talbot local health board due to meet on 1 april to make a final decision on the unit 's future .
on friday , a group of mothers held a protest at the hospital over what they say is a downgrading of services .
under the proposals , which were recommended by a review group set up by the health board in december , maternity services will be provided by midwives , with non-routine and emergency cases transferred to consultant-led units at hospitals in bridgend and swansea .
there have been protests against the maternity unit plans the £ 64m hospital , which opened last november , at baglan , port talbot , has been unable to recruit enough medical staff for the maternity unit , leading to the recommendation to move to a midwife-led facility .
the health board has denied that a midwife-led unit would amount to a downgrading of maternity care in neath port talbot .
but the recommendations have led to protests from people living locally , who object to some mothers from the area having to travel to swansea or bridgend to give birth .
a 5,000-signature petition has been collected against the proposals .
if the proposal is finally adopted , following the public consultation , the new service could be up and running by april .

a few too many the night before and the morning brings headaches , nausea - and the pledge that you 'll never drink again .
but then you do .
given that experience tells us drinking will ultimately lead to such symptoms , why do people still do it and what makes alcohol addictive ?
the answer is a complex jigsaw of brain chemicals , personality and genetics .
' tranquiliser ' many of the clues lie deep within the brain .
alcohol triggers the release of dopamine - a chemical which produces feelings of satisfaction .
it also increases the production of the brain 's natural painkiller - endorphin - which scientists think could be the means by which the brain becomes trained to crave .
in addition , drinking affects the glutamate and gaba , chemicals which control how essential messages are sent between nerve cells in the brain .
scientists believe this effect is part of the development of tolerance to , and dependence on , alcohol .
but dr jonathon chick , a consultant psychiatrist at edinburgh university said : " chemicals are only part of the picture , they do not explain it fully .
" for example , there are people who have a nervous , anxious disposition .
" if they start to use alcohol as a tranquiliser , that can become addictive . "
genetic link " the way to stop people drinking and prevent addiction is simply to put up the price of alcohol " dr jonathan chick , edinburgh university dr david ball , a researcher for the charity action on addiction. added : " there are psychological traits , such as sensation seeking , which are linked to illicit drug use - though there is not a specific addictive personality . "
another part of the explanation lies in a person 's genes .
someone whose parents had a problem with alcohol have a 10-fold chance of having a problem themselves compared to someone whose parents did not have a problem .
researchers are currently investigating which genes are responsible .
doctors say the increased availability of alcohol means genetic predispositions to addiction - and the biological effects of drinking too much are triggered more often .
dr ball said : " people can have a genetic predisposition to alcohol addiction , but it ca n't be triggered if people are n't exposed to alcohol in the first place . "
dr crick added : " more people are drinking more often , and so more of the at-risk people end up in difficulties compared to 30 years ago when fewer people drank . "
both doctors welcomed the recent recommendation from the academy of medical sciences which said the cost of alcohol should increase by 10 % to encourage people to drink less .
dr crick concluded : " the only way to stop people drinking and prevent addiction is to put up the price of alcohol . "

given that experience tells us drinking will ultimately lead to such symptoms , why do people still do it and what makes alcohol addictive ?
the answer is a complex jigsaw of brain chemicals , personality and genetics .
' tranquiliser ' many of the clues lie deep within the brain .
alcohol triggers the release of dopamine - a chemical which produces feelings of satisfaction .
it also increases the production of the brain 's natural painkiller - endorphin - which scientists think could be the means by which the brain becomes trained to crave .
in addition , drinking affects the glutamate and gaba , chemicals which control how essential messages are sent between nerve cells in the brain .
scientists believe this effect is part of the development of tolerance to , and dependence on , alcohol .
but dr jonathon chick , a consultant psychiatrist at edinburgh university said : " chemicals are only part of the picture , they do not explain it fully .

" if they start to use alcohol as a tranquiliser , that can become addictive . "
genetic link the way to stop people drinking and prevent addiction is simply to put up the price of alcohol dr jonathan chick , edinburgh university dr david ball , a researcher for the charity action on addiction. added : " there are psychological traits , such as sensation seeking , which are linked to illicit drug use - though there is not a specific addictive personality . "
another part of the explanation lies in a person 's genes .
someone whose parents had a problem with alcohol have a 10-fold chance of having a problem themselves compared to someone whose parents did not have a problem .
researchers are currently investigating which genes are responsible .
doctors say the increased availability of alcohol means genetic predispositions to addiction - and the biological effects of drinking too much are triggered more often .
dr ball said : " people can have a genetic predisposition to alcohol addiction , but it ca n't be triggered if people are n't exposed to alcohol in the first place . "
dr crick added : " more people are drinking more often , and so more of the at-risk people end up in difficulties compared to 30 years ago when fewer people drank . "
both doctors welcomed the recent recommendation from the academy of medical sciences which said the cost of alcohol should increase by 10 % to encourage people to drink less .
dr crick concluded : " the only way to stop people drinking and prevent addiction is to put up the price of alcohol . "

the job ads hide their real origins by claiming to be posted by charities looking for people to forward donations made by hi-tech firms .
those taking the job are promised a fee for every package forwarded .
the most sophisticated scammers are using the names of real charities and copying their websites to convince applicants that the organisation needs help .
one charity , the russian orphan opportunity fund -lrb- roof -rrb- , has seen adverts on uk jobsites using its name .
it has also had websites created by the scammers shut down three times .
hi-tech donations " the websites looked very legitimate , " said georgia williams , who runs the uk roof office with her husband , " they copied huge swathes of info from our site and re-organised it .
" they did a pretty professional job considering they were ripping everything off , " she told bbc news online .
one section the criminals added to the site were testimonials from hi-tech firms about the hardware they had " donated " to roof .
andrew williams said this copy was stolen from other websites but was used by the thieves to make their job adverts for " remote assistants " more plausible .
the websites used to support the job adverts used variations on the " roof " name .
one substituted zeros for the os in " roof " .
mr williams said roof had heard about the con from people concerned that it was illegitimate .
he said he knew people in the uk , us and germany had responded to the job ads .
delivery point student sebastien thibault , who lives in edinburgh , responded to an advert for a " correspondence manager " on the monster.co.uk website in february .
text on the ad read : " as we receive donations from all over the world we need assistants who could receive charity , sort , store , and make it ready for dispatching to the orphanages , following the instructions of our managers . "
soon after his job application was accepted parcels started turning up at his home that he was asked to forward to an address in russia .
in the first couple of days he received a sony dsc-f828 cyber-shot camera , a sony vaio laptop , an mp3 player , a bluetooth headset and usb storage keys .
suspicious about this largesse he contacted the police and roof .
a spokeswoman for the uk 's national hi-tech crime unit said it knew about this type of con and was investigating some cases .
the fake roof advert has now been removed from the monster.co.uk website , which said it did not know that it had been put up by scammers .
hernan daguerre , european director of communications for monster , said monster was not aware that any of the job adverts on its site were being placed by conmen .
he said that the sheer number of job adverts posted on monster made it difficult to police all of them .
" but , " he added , " if we have any information that any information in the adverts is fraudulent or deceptive or false we would take it down . "
mr daguerre said all applicants should be vigilant when replying to adverts and avoid giving out too much personal information .
dodgy transactions adverts for so-called " correspondence managers " for companies known to be involved in this type of scam can easily be found on many net job sites .
the " re-shipping " or " correspondence manager " con has been seen in the us and is included in the fbi 's ongoing operation cybersweep investigation that targets hi-tech crimes .
in some cases the bank accounts of those who fall for the job ads are used to funnel cash from auction sales of stolen goods to the criminals .
frank wilkins , vice-president of risk management for visa europe , said efforts to stamp out credit card fraud were making criminals look for new ways to commit crimes .
he said many us and uk e-commerce sites were wary of shipping goods to addresses in eastern europe and other countries because of past experiences with fraudsters .
mr wilkins said this explained why credit card thieves were looking for people to forward stolen goods on to them .
initiatives such as address verification , verified by visa and the credit verification value -lrb- cvv2 -rrb- were all helping to reduce card fraud .
some merchants , he said , were using transaction screening to help spot dodgy transactions .
he said : " they can ask : ' has that card been used at that merchant for previously fraudulent transactions ? " '
he added : " e-commerce is a growing area of our business and it is unfortunate that as the business grows fraud grows too . "

40-year-old lesley martin is the country 's best known advocate for euthanasia .
she could face up to 14 years in jail if found guilty of attempting to kill her mother by suffocation .
the attempted murder charge dates back to 1999 when lesley martin 's 69 year-old mother was dying of bowel cancer .
ms martin cared for her mother for five months before giving her an overdose of morphine and later smothering her with a pillow .
the woman died the following day .
three years later martin published a book about the experience , saying her actions were in keeping with her mother 's wishes .
it was after reading the book that new zealand police decided to pursue a homicide investigation .
ms martin was arrested and charged with attempted murder .
the case has caused widespread debate in new zealand , where euthanasia was the subject of a parliamentary vote only last year .
a proposed new law which would have legalised euthanasia was narrowly defeated despite support from the prime minister .
the lesley martin trial is expected to last two weeks .
although she could face a maximum of 14 years in jail if found guilty , analysts say a more likely outcome is a sentence closer to two years , perhaps served as home detention .

40-year-old lesley martin is the country 's best known advocate for euthanasia .
she could face up to 14 years in jail if found guilty of attempting to kill her mother by suffocation .
the attempted murder charge dates back to 1999 when lesley martin 's 69 year-old mother was dying of bowel cancer .
ms martin cared for her mother for five months before giving her an overdose of morphine and later smothering her with a pillow .
the woman died the following day .
three years later martin published a book about the experience , saying her actions were in keeping with her mother 's wishes .
it was after reading the book that new zealand police decided to pursue a homicide investigation .
ms martin was arrested and charged with attempted murder .
the case has caused widespread debate in new zealand , where euthanasia was the subject of a parliamentary vote only last year .
a proposed new law which would have legalised euthanasia was narrowly defeated despite support from the prime minister .
the lesley martin trial is expected to last two weeks .
although she could face a maximum of 14 years in jail if found guilty , analysts say a more likely outcome is a sentence closer to two years , perhaps served as home detention .
since her mother 's death , lesley martin has established exit new zealand , a pro-euthanasia lobby group .

one russian charity has been abused by criminals the job ads hide their real origins by claiming to be posted by charities looking for people to forward donations made by hi-tech firms .
those taking the job are promised a fee for every package forwarded .
the most sophisticated scammers are using the names of real charities and copying their websites to convince applicants that the organisation needs help .
one charity , the russian orphan opportunity fund -lrb- roof -rrb- , has seen adverts on uk jobsites using its name .
it has also had websites created by the scammers shut down three times .
hi-tech donations " the websites looked very legitimate , " said georgia williams , who runs the uk roof office with her husband , " they copied huge swathes of info from our site and re-organised it .
" they did a pretty professional job considering they were ripping everything off , " she told bbc news online .
one section the criminals added to the site were testimonials from hi-tech firms about the hardware they had " donated " to roof .
andrew williams said this copy was stolen from other websites but was used by the thieves to make their job adverts for " remote assistants " more plausible .
the websites used to support the job adverts used variations on the " roof " name .
one substituted zeros for the os in " roof " .
mr williams said roof had heard about the con from people concerned that it was illegitimate .
he said he knew people in the uk , us and germany had responded to the job ads .
delivery point student sebastien thibault , who lives in edinburgh , responded to an advert for a " correspondence manager " on the monster.co.uk website in february .
the fake website was seeking " remote assistants " text on the ad read : " as we receive donations from all over the world we need assistants who could receive charity , sort , store , and make it ready for dispatching to the orphanages , following the instructions of our managers . "
soon after his job application was accepted parcels started turning up at his home that he was asked to forward to an address in russia .
in the first couple of days he received a sony dsc-f828 cyber-shot camera , a sony vaio laptop , an mp3 player , a bluetooth headset and usb storage keys .
suspicious about this largesse he contacted the police and roof .
a spokeswoman for the uk 's national hi-tech crime unit said it knew about this type of con and was investigating some cases .
the fake roof advert has now been removed from the monster.co.uk website , which said it did not know that it had been put up by scammers .
hernan daguerre , european director of communications for monster , said monster was not aware that any of the job adverts on its site were being placed by conmen .
he said that the sheer number of job adverts posted on monster made it difficult to police all of them .
" but , " he added , " if we have any information that any information in the adverts is fraudulent or deceptive or false we would take it down . "
mr daguerre said all applicants should be vigilant when replying to adverts and avoid giving out too much personal information .
dodgy transactions adverts for so-called " correspondence managers " for companies known to be involved in this type of scam can easily be found on many net job sites .
the " re-shipping " or " correspondence manager " con has been seen in the us and is included in the fbi 's ongoing operation cybersweep investigation that targets hi-tech crimes .
the goods were being shipped to russia in some cases the bank accounts of those who fall for the job ads are used to funnel cash from auction sales of stolen goods to the criminals .
frank wilkins , vice-president of risk management for visa europe , said efforts to stamp out credit card fraud were making criminals look for new ways to commit crimes .
he said many us and uk e-commerce sites were wary of shipping goods to addresses in eastern europe and other countries because of past experiences with fraudsters .
mr wilkins said this explained why credit card thieves were looking for people to forward stolen goods on to them .
initiatives such as address verification , verified by visa and the credit verification value -lrb- cvv2 -rrb- were all helping to reduce card fraud .
some merchants , he said , were using transaction screening to help spot dodgy transactions .
he said : " they can ask : ' has that card been used at that merchant for previously fraudulent transactions ? " '
he added : " e-commerce is a growing area of our business and it is unfortunate that as the business grows fraud grows too . "

one russian charity has been abused by criminals the job ads hide their real origins by claiming to be posted by charities looking for people to forward donations made by hi-tech firms .
those taking the job are promised a fee for every package forwarded .
the most sophisticated scammers are using the names of real charities and copying their websites to convince applicants that the organisation needs help .
one charity , the russian orphan opportunity fund -lrb- roof -rrb- , has seen adverts on uk jobsites using its name .
it has also had websites created by the scammers shut down three times .
hi-tech donations " the websites looked very legitimate , " said georgia williams , who runs the uk roof office with her husband , " they copied huge swathes of info from our site and re-organised it .
" they did a pretty professional job considering they were ripping everything off , " she told bbc news online .
one section the criminals added to the site were testimonials from hi-tech firms about the hardware they had " donated " to roof .
andrew williams said this copy was stolen from other websites but was used by the thieves to make their job adverts for " remote assistants " more plausible .
the websites used to support the job adverts used variations on the " roof " name .
one substituted zeros for the os in " roof " .
mr williams said roof had heard about the con from people concerned that it was illegitimate .
he said he knew people in the uk , us and germany had responded to the job ads .
delivery point student sebastien thibault , who lives in edinburgh , responded to an advert for a " correspondence manager " on the monster.co.uk website in february .
the fake website was seeking " remote assistants " text on the ad read : " as we receive donations from all over the world we need assistants who could receive charity , sort , store , and make it ready for dispatching to the orphanages , following the instructions of our managers . "
soon after his job application was accepted parcels started turning up at his home that he was asked to forward to an address in russia .
in the first couple of days he received a sony dsc-f828 cyber-shot camera , a sony vaio laptop , an mp3 player , a bluetooth headset and usb storage keys .
suspicious about this largesse he contacted the police and roof .
a spokeswoman for the uk 's national hi-tech crime unit said it knew about this type of con and was investigating some cases .
the fake roof advert has now been removed from the monster.co.uk website , which said it did not know that it had been put up by scammers .
hernan daguerre , european director of communications for monster , said monster was not aware that any of the job adverts on its site were being placed by conmen .
he said that the sheer number of job adverts posted on monster made it difficult to police all of them .
" but , " he added , " if we have any information that any information in the adverts is fraudulent or deceptive or false we would take it down . "
mr daguerre said all applicants should be vigilant when replying to adverts and avoid giving out too much personal information .
dodgy transactions adverts for so-called " correspondence managers " for companies known to be involved in this type of scam can easily be found on many net job sites .
the " re-shipping " or " correspondence manager " con has been seen in the us and is included in the fbi 's ongoing operation cybersweep investigation that targets hi-tech crimes .
the goods were being shipped to russia in some cases the bank accounts of those who fall for the job ads are used to funnel cash from auction sales of stolen goods to the criminals .
frank wilkins , vice-president of risk management for visa europe , said efforts to stamp out credit card fraud were making criminals look for new ways to commit crimes .
he said many us and uk e-commerce sites were wary of shipping goods to addresses in eastern europe and other countries because of past experiences with fraudsters .
mr wilkins said this explained why credit card thieves were looking for people to forward stolen goods on to them .
initiatives such as address verification , verified by visa and the credit verification value -lrb- cvv2 -rrb- were all helping to reduce card fraud .
some merchants , he said , were using transaction screening to help spot dodgy transactions .
he said : " they can ask : ' has that card been used at that merchant for previously fraudulent transactions ? " '
he added : " e-commerce is a growing area of our business and it is unfortunate that as the business grows fraud grows too . "

but this is one game that has proved hugely expensive , and critics are wondering if the government can stay in it for the long term .
five years after tony blair delighted his supporters by committing to ' end child poverty ' by 2020 , real progress has been made .
thanks to extra spending on the child tax credit of nearly a billion pounds announced in the pre-budget report , the government looks set to hit its interim target of reducing child poverty by a quarter by april 2005 .
that 's over a million children lifted out of poverty , and child poverty at its lowest level since 1989 .
poverty in britain what is the poverty line and how many live beneath it ?
at-a-glance though there is no specific target on pensioner poverty , half a million pensioners were raised above the poverty level by 2001/2 .
more could benefit following the introduction of the pension credit .
widespread poverty yet , as dr paul dornan of child poverty action group -lrb- cpag -rrb- points out , poverty still " spreads across the length and breadth of britain " .
according to cpag , the uk has the second worst regional inequality in the industrialised world after mexico .
and the limited poverty reductions to date have proved enormously expensive .
by 2004-5 , the government will have increased support for families with children by £ 10.4 billion since 1997 in real terms - a 72 % increase .
but around 3 million children will still be poor on the traditional measure .
why has n't poverty budged more ?
david willetts , tory work and pensions spokesman , argues that gordon brown 's beloved tax credits system is n't working very well - partly because of low take-up in the face of complicated form filling , and partly because it has extended means-testing to people on middle incomes .
many pensioners do n't take up the benefits they are entitled to there 's something in this - especially for pensioner benefits .
analysis by cpag shows that between £ 470m and £ 820m of the minimum income guarantee , the precursor of the pension credit , went unclaimed .
but it 's not the whole story .
most experts think that the real issue is simply that poverty reduction is inherently very hard .
hard labour the traditional way of defining poverty is through a relative measure based on a percentage of average incomes .
labour has got some poorer families with kids into work and given higher benefits , so many are - in ' absolute ' terms - better off than in 1997 .
in cash terms that amounts to an extra £ 55 a week for the 10 % worst-off families .
but not all of this has shown up in the poverty figures because all families have got richer .
labour has been chasing a moving target .
just to hold poverty where it is means giving increases in benefits in line with average incomes .
to reduce it requires more money on top of this .
the independent think tank the institute for fiscal studies predicted last year that reducing child poverty to half its 1998-9 level will cost £ 5.5 billion extra .
new definition perhaps that is why labour had recently given a new definition to child poverty that introduces a less challenging relative measure , alongside two more ' absolute ' measures .
critics accuse it of shifting the goalposts to elbow 800,000 kids off the balance sheet .
fair point perhaps , but the new definition does n't really help the government escape the fundamental problem .
even using it , poverty reduction will still mean large spending increases .
where will gordon brown find them in a tight new spending round ?
november 's pre-budget report knocked this question off the top of the agenda for this week by pumping cash into the bits of child tax credit targeted on the poorest .
but it also included worrying signs for the future .
other benefits important to tackling child poverty like working tax credit and child benefit were only increased in line with prices .
and the increase in child tax credit was offset by a real terms cut in the part going to most families .
the labour-affiliated fabian society says that it is about fundamental political priorities : the chancellor must make the case for greater redistribution of wealth if it is to meet its long term goals .
it is launching a commission to examine how ministers can change the terms of public debate .
but there are no easy answers .
the 2003 budget commissioned a review to look at how to reduce poverty long-term .
for gordon brown to deliver the royal flush of ending child poverty , let alone addressing pensioner poverty , it may have to deal him something very special .

five years after tony blair delighted his supporters by committing to ' end child poverty ' by 2020 , real progress has been made .
thanks to extra spending on the child tax credit of nearly a billion pounds announced in the pre-budget report , the government looks set to hit its interim target of reducing child poverty by a quarter by april 2005 .
that 's over a million children lifted out of poverty , and child poverty at its lowest level since 1989 .
poverty in britain what is the poverty line and how many live beneath it ?
at-a-glance though there is no specific target on pensioner poverty , half a million pensioners were raised above the poverty level by 2001/2 .
more could benefit following the introduction of the pension credit .
widespread poverty yet , as dr paul dornan of child poverty action group -lrb- cpag -rrb- points out , poverty still " spreads across the length and breadth of britain " .
according to cpag , the uk has the second worst regional inequality in the industrialised world after mexico .
and the limited poverty reductions to date have proved enormously expensive .
by 2004-5 , the government will have increased support for families with children by £ 10.4 billion since 1997 in real terms - a 72 % increase .
but around 3 million children will still be poor on the traditional measure .
why has n't poverty budged more ?
david willetts , tory work and pensions spokesman , argues that gordon brown 's beloved tax credits system is n't working very well - partly because of low take-up in the face of complicated form filling , and partly because it has extended means-testing to people on middle incomes .
many pensioners do n't take up the benefits they are entitled to there 's something in this - especially for pensioner benefits .
analysis by cpag shows that between £ 470m and £ 820m of the minimum income guarantee , the precursor of the pension credit , went unclaimed .
but it 's not the whole story .
most experts think that the real issue is simply that poverty reduction is inherently very hard .
hard labour the traditional way of defining poverty is through a relative measure based on a percentage of average incomes .
labour has got some poorer families with kids into work and given higher benefits , so many are - in ' absolute ' terms - better off than in 1997 .
in cash terms that amounts to an extra £ 55 a week for the 10 % worst-off families .
but not all of this has shown up in the poverty figures because all families have got richer .
labour has been chasing a moving target .
just to hold poverty where it is means giving increases in benefits in line with average incomes .
to reduce it requires more money on top of this .
the independent think tank the institute for fiscal studies predicted last year that reducing child poverty to half its 1998-9 level will cost £ 5.5 billion extra .
new definition perhaps that is why labour had recently given a new definition to child poverty that introduces a less challenging relative measure , alongside two more ' absolute ' measures .
critics accuse it of shifting the goalposts to elbow 800,000 kids off the balance sheet .
fair point perhaps , but the new definition does n't really help the government escape the fundamental problem .
even using it , poverty reduction will still mean large spending increases .

"
the last few days , from the 11 march bomb attacks in madrid to the socialists ' defeat of the ruling partido popular at the elections , have indeed been like a dream .
the nightmare , the restlessness , the waiting for daylight and finally a new dawn .
but after a night of celebrations in madrid for the socialist psoe party , they wake to a city still grieving for the dead , still scarred by the terror .
psoe leader jose luis rodriguez zapatero , who is known for his humility , asked for a minute 's silence for the victims of the attacks as he addressed his jubilant supporters . "
the youth above all has brought us back .
they know what is best for them .
they have said no to the war and no to terrorism and all spanish people want peace " rafael lopez economist the victory was much more than the party had hoped for .
their principal aim was to ensure pp did not get an absolute majority .
but in an unprecedented upset , they won .
economist rafael lopez , 52 , said victory had been hard work .
" the youth above all has brought us back .
they know what is best for them .
they have said no to the war and no to terrorism and all spanish people want peace . "
the mobilisation of protesters against the government 's decision to join the us-led war in iraq was repeated in demonstrations against terrorism and , on saturday , against the government 's handling of the madrid bombing .
turnout for the elections , for many a personal show of faith in democracy and their right to vote , was 77.2 % , around 9 % higher than in 2000 .
law student miguel perez , 20 , said spain had had enough of the pp 's lies .
" i really think this will start changes for the good , " he said .
" i think we 'll see social policies such as aid for the poor , better working conditions , and better living conditions as there are not enough homes .
i think there will be a general change in internal and external policies . "
it is long list for the new government which inherits a buoyant economy , built up over eight years after the country was left in disarray by the former socialist government .
the left has emerged strong from these elections and psoe is likely to find allies in the catalan left -lrb- erc -rrb- and the united left -lrb- iu -rrb- , whose leader said it had lost some seats for the greater good of defeating pp .
' dirty campaign ' but monday 's abc newspaper accused the left of a dirty campaign against the government . "
never in the history of our democracy has a party beaten the absolute majority of the opposition , never has a candidate achieved power at the first attempt " el mundo newspaper " it seemed they would not talk about eta or the alliances of power in catalunya .
taboo .
but the ban stopped when talking about al-qaeda and the chance to throw mud at the government of aznar , an honoured and honourable man .
it was open season against the right , " it said .
el mundo leads with the headline " spain punishes pp and puts its faith in zapatero " .
" never in the history of our democracy has a party beaten the absolute majority of the opposition , never has a candidate achieved power at the first attempt , " it says .
" if it has happened this time around , without taking anything away from the socialist leader , it has largely been down to the strong punishment vote towards aznar 's conduct in this legislature . "
el pais says turnout seemed to be the people 's response to " attempts to destabilise the country by terrorists who chose to organise the madrid killings on the eve of elections " .
la razon agrees that the attacks and the decision to join the war in iraq had been a decisive factor .
as the election fog clears , spaniards get back to a harsh reality .
there are still dozens of victims in a serious condition in the hospitals and some bodies are yet to be identified .
but as an initial sign of getting back to some form of normality , one of the railway lines targeted by the bombers opened on monday .

but dr bhagat warns of other concerns to do with the effect rampant commercialism might have on india .
he predicts falling values causing rising divorce , teen pregnancy , crime and depression .

" the politicians are playing the same game as marketeers , " he argues .
" being sold this feel-good factor which at one level is non-existent , sold to believe we 're better off than we were - that 's no different from selling soap . "

with a turnout of 62 % of the electorate , mr putin gained over 70 % of the vote .
his closest rival , the communist candidate , nikolai kharitonov , polled 14 % .
so how can mr putin be expected to use his power ?
' strong leader ' western politicians may criticise the russian way of running elections .
outside moscow , for many people life has hardly changed since 1991 they may say - with justification - that the media was incredibly biased towards mr putin in the run-up to the election .
but that does n't explain mr putin 's undoubted popularity in russia .
mr putin has shown himself to be the kind of strong leader which , many people believe , russian history has shown is the only way to rule the world 's largest country .
receiving a huge mandate , though , is only the start .
the questions are already being asked as to how mr putin plans to use his power .
hopes and fears shortly after 0100 local time -lrb- 2200 gmt -rrb- mr putin gave his first post-election press conference .
putin has proved he can punch hard he stressed that the economic and social stability which was achieved in his first term was not a goal in itself .
it merely provides the necessary background in order to ensure that the well-being of the russian people can be improved .
behind that phrase there stand the hopes and fears of millions of russians .
looking at moscow , it 's tempting to conclude that russia has shaken off the worse elements of the soviet past , which caused shortages of basic goods and political repression .
moscow is a thriving , modern city .
not only are new office blocks shooting up , as russians like to say , " like mushrooms after the rain " , but new housing is being provided for many ordinary citizens .
but get out into the wider expanses of russia , and you see that for many people life has hardly changed since the soviet union fell apart at the end of 1991 .
' mirror of society ' statistics may show that the russian economy is growing at a healthy rate .
statistics , though , can hide a multitude of social and economic problems .
khodorkovsky , russia 's richest man , watched the election from prison the russian economy relies heavily on natural resources , especially oil and gas .
a serious fall in the world oil price would have a damaging effect on that part of the russian economy that is currently healthy .
the small business climate has improved during mr putin 's first term , but much needs to be done in terms of legislation to give entrepreneurs protection from the whims of bureaucrats .
huge problems remain in agriculture .
the soviet system of collectivisation was a disastrous agricultural experiment , from which the countryside is still trying to recover .
very little has been done in the last 13 years to address the deep-seated problems that remain .
morale in the military is low .
there has been much talk of " military reform " in recent years , but the russian army remains a brutalised and brutalising force .
it is an area of society which mr putin seems to have been almost too scared to take on .
many see the military as a mirror of russian society .
if that is the case , then mr putin does n't have to look far beneath the surface to find plenty of problems to tackle in his second term .

the operation easter initiative has run throughout the nesting season on the island since 1995 .
mull attracts egg thieves because of its population of eagles , particularly the white-tailed sea eagle , which was reintroduced to scotland 20 years ago .
strathclyde police said changes to wildlife law had made it easier to crack down on the criminals .
however , the force still relies on the general public to help spot anyone suspicious .
over the next six weeks the police and wildlife groups , aided by members of the public , will keep a round-the-clock watch on nesting sites .
the campaign is a prime example of the way in which a partnership approach and community engagement can prove successful chief superintendent mitch roger strathclyde police anything untoward is reported to wildlife liaison officer constable finlay christine .
he said : " they basically stand guard on nesting sites throughout the island .
" the people who are not actually involved in the nesting watch itself - people like the postmen and the bus drivers and the calmac ferry crews - they all phone in suspicious vehicles to me .
" everyone is involved , it involves the whole island . "
the number of sea eagle chicks hatched in scotland doubled last year to 26 .
however , they are still endangered and the strathclyde force warned that stealing their eggs could lead to the birds ' extinction .
mull is home to a large proportion of scotland 's white-tailed sea eagles .
community model strathclyde police , who are leading the initiative , said wildlife crime was a core policing issue .
the whole community is involved in the scheme chief superintendent mitch roger said : " the campaign is a prime example of the way in which a partnership approach and community engagement can prove successful .
" strathclyde police is delighted to be working with the scottish executive , the rspb , scottish national heritage , landrover and the people of mull to ensure that the future of one of our rarest species of eagle is protected . "
dave dick , senior investigation officer for rspb scotland , said : " operation easter has developed over the years as an excellent model of how we can work together to protect scotland 's birds and stop wildlife crime . "
funded by the scottish executive , the initiative also involves forest enterprise , wings over mull birds of prey and conservation centre and local people who work together to track down the thieves .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic a

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or ot

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

we discussed this issue in our weekly global phone-in programme talking point .
our guests were the grand mufti of bosnia-hercegovina dr mustafa ceric , french mps herve mariton and natalie kosciusko-morizet and syrian analyst and commentator rima allaf watch now click here to listen the french parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a ban on islamic headscarves and all other overt religious symbols from state schools .
the bill was carried by a massive majority of 494 votes to 36 .
polls suggest most french people support the ban but it has outraged some muslims and other religious communities .
president jacques chirac has said the ban is necessary to preserve the national principle of secularity .
is it right to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools ?
or will such a move alienate , rather than integrate , communities such as muslims ?

read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : unity can not be achieved by oppressive behaviour , but with love and respect for individuals freedom of choice it can be .
taran , ottawa , canada no .
that move is a rather self defeatist move and one that shows the inability of the society to co-exist in a culturally diversified environment .
is europe failing to accommodate their religiously conscious population ?
m. h. ussif , london i agree with the french about where to bring about some kind of equality , i would also start about banning religious schools and i hope that this starts to happen in my own country adrian king , west bromwich , england trying to stop religious bashing or terrorism by banning the open practice of religion is like trying to stop people smoking by making breathing a crime .
leszek luchowski , lille , france interfering in anyone 's practice of their religion is oppressive -lrb- assuming the practice does not physically harm or otherwise impede on others -rrb- .
mike , atlanta , usa i 'm having a hard time understanding how this ban will " integrate " children into mainstream french culture .
pointing fingers at these girls and telling them that what they 're wearing is wrong will only cause more division .
s. cardoza , san francisco , california headscarves should be allowed in school because as long as it does not harm anyone else , people have a right to follow the guidelines of their religion .
paul , usa a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women bjorn h , the hague , netherlands a ban on headscarves is not a ban on islam or a ban on the decency of muslim women .
i think any developed society should look critically at all discriminating behaviour that is being promoted in the name of religion .
bjorn h , the hague , netherlands of course it is not right , i am living in the middle east where i see the people here have their say whether they wear the hijab or not , surely it is against human rights to stop people wearing a sign of their religion .
should we not be looking more at what happens to these people than what they wear .
alan fawcett , manama , bahrain in my opinion a person should be judged on there actions and not how they look .
muslims , jews , christians ... can all be faithful to their religion by their actions and the treatment of others .
i appreciate that head scarves are an important symbol but that is all it is .
my point is that in order stop bigotry , racism and planned segregation , it should begin at grass roots levels .
if or children can all get on and see each other as equals this is surely the best for the future .
greg hughes , maldives democracy was n't invented to give the majority the right to kick minorities around .
julian , brighton , uk yes , headscarves should be banned to ensure france 's sensible efforts to keep religion separate from the state .
also " when in rome . "
jessica macfarlane , hamilton , new zealand i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french ingrid , nogent , france i feel that many people outside france do n't understand the position of the french .
a ban on these signs is not a ban on religion but an effort to provide equal rights for education .
the french are not racist they want to integrate rather than create communities which do n't mix together .
this has been going on for close to one hundred years .
also , a majority of muslims in france are for the ban because they precisely have a choice in wearing a headscarf or not .
ingrid , nogent , france what worries me the most is , what will they ban next ?
i thought the french had a revolution to have freedom .
a government should work for the people not tell them what to wear .
i think the issue is bigger than just religious symbols .
surly the government should be protecting the rights of the people to practice the religion of their choice , even school children have that basic right .
jackie coughlan , spain i feel it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
sajeer , calicut india allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences mark , dubai french state schools may be the only place where impressionable children can interact without having each others ' religious t-shirts sticking in each others ' faces .
it may be the one opportunity for children to form bonds devoid of religious indoctrination or prejudicial conditioning .
allow children to celebrate their similarities , not their differences .
mark , dubai from arguments i have heard people are commenting on how this ban will cause people to loose their identity , which i think is wrong .
the french are asking for the ban to be during school time not at all times .
i think that this ban will be very beneficial when religious tensions are so high as it means that all the children will look the same within school and bullying can not be put down to racism .
lindsey hudspeth , durham , england the french gave hope to the sikh community that they will find a solution for their turban .
why is there no public statement about french offering to find a solution for muslims women or men who choose to wear certain cloths ?
if sikhs are allowed it will clearly be a ban against muslims which seems to be the real issue any way .
faisal , toronto , canada there should be freedom of worship and dressing , if a particular religion defines its mode of dressing or covering , so let it be .
philip a jamani , lagos , nigeria only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam samira f , london , uk the headscarf is only a symbol of female oppression to people who have a poor understanding of islam and no contact with women who wear headscarves .
i pray that this absurd law and the publicity that surrounds it encourages people to find out what drives strong muslim women to want to make the choice to wear a headscarf when it causes them so much hassle .
samira f , london , uk a lot of schools worldwide request children to wear a uniform to go to school .
one of the most important purposes of this is to make social classes , religions and money differences disappear and allow serenity at school .
french schools do not require the children to wear such a uniform .
therefore , i think all strong signs of distinctiveness should be banned , in order to not divide a small school world in clans .
i strongly support the french decision .
christophe , argentina i understand the sentiment but think the ban is likely to be counterproductive .
martin douglas petry , hiroshima , japan schools should not be allowed to ask girls to remove headscarves or any other item of clothing in a decent society .
mak , london , uk in the opinion of the majority of french people , the headscarf is inappropriate in schools .
it would be a travesty of the democratic process if the views of the majority were ignored simply to appease a minority of people who are unwilling to accept the culture of the country where they live .
if any french muslims have a problem with this , they are quite within their rights to go and live somewhere else .
jo , london i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands i think that the headscarves should be banned .
while i was at school , we were not allowed to wear hats , even caps during break times when it was sunny but muslims were allowed to cover their heads , this was unfair .
muslim children were also allowed to wear religious jewellery where as christians were not allowed to wear st christopher 's or crosses , this is also unfair .
i believe that allowing some children to show what religion they are and denying others alienates muslims anyway .
sarah green , west bromwich , west midlands if these people want to set themselves aside , above and different from the infidel non-muslims , then they must be allowed to .
laws should n't apply to minority groups and religious law should take precedence over national law in every case .
gavin do-gooder , scotland gavin blod , aberdeen , scotland i believe that the are on the right track , and we should do the same here .
david , leeds if muslim women want to wear a headscarf then they should be allowed to , it is their right .
we do n't ban miniskirts / microskirts , low cut tops or anything of that ilk on women who decide to wear them .
whatever happened to the so called values espoused by the french - liberty , equality and fraternity .
i personally think that the french find islam a threat to their way of life .
islam is n't a threat. so people should be allowed to wear what they like freely .
asif , slough , england i think the french government is badly confused !
secularism needs to be practised by institutions and not by individuals .
as long the following of one 's religion does not infringe upon the rights of others , what business does the govt. have banning things like the hijab ?
k. lal , cambridge , uk why are we making such a fuss of france trying to deprive women on the right to wear a headscarf , but almost completely ignoring iran 's law that forces women to wear them in public ?
this is blatant double standards and we ought to start being consistent .
graeme phillips , berlin , germany -lrb- normally uk -rrb- i think the french are right to ban overt religious symbols .
when children go to school they should have the opportunity to develop themselves away from their cultural and religious baggage ; baggage which they are given by their parents .
only then will they have a chance to become integrated in any true sense .
the french position is not one of intolerance but one of great clarity which will allow the children greater freedom to build normal relationships with their peers .
david brough , basel , switzerland as an american , i find that baseball is my religion .
would that mean i could not wear a baseball cap in a french school ?
this sounds to me that we are talking about a dress code .
not islam vs. the west .
john t , us / uk the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied neil allen , paris , france there is supposed to be a ban on religious symbols in french schools already .
the present situation arose because the rules were unevenly applied , leaving individual heads to take ad-hoc decisions .
this resulted in the government being asked for clarification of the law , which is now being provided .
neil allen , paris , france the french ban on headscarves in school is an excellent idea .
schools are no place for rigid ideologies of any variety .
when children become adults , they can decide for themselves but until then it is crucial that the state provides a secular environment .
m. hill , uk m. chirac has scored a potentially damaging own goal .
his action is clearly designed as a political ploy to curry favour with those of a xenophobic persuasion in france but the policy will almost certainly be overturned by the european court of human rights .
fortunately for him the court will rule long after the political benefits of his action will have been reaped by him , after which he can give a gallic shrug and say " well , i tried . "
it 's an own goal because he has polarized french opinion and created unnecessary resentment .
live and let live is my view .
david , london , uk in the uk we are fortunate to live in an ethnically mixed society .
the contribution of different cultures and religions helps our society to develop rather than stagnate .
i would be horrified to see such a ban coming to the uk .
we should embrace and enjoy these differences .
steve , london uk before we all start getting hysterical , it 's not just islamic headscarves - it 's all overt religious symbols .
fraser , england secularism should not mean religious fascism .
to have a secular state is fine , but the people should be treated as individuals within the state , not as identical drones of the collective .
to deny someone their religious practices is to deny them their rights and choices .
we talk so freely of " western civilisation " ; are we really any better than those we claim to fight ?
tanya , london , uk the french have every right to insist that those that wish to live in their country abide by its rules and values .
being a multi-cultural society means we must appreciate , accept and enjoy cultural diversity , but it must be based around that society 's core values .
it is legal to have more than one wife in some parts of the world , while it is not here , as but one example .
equally if i were to live in the middle east i would expect tolerance of my christian persuasion but accept the need to conform to their core values .
if you allow a minority to impose its own particular core values on the indigenous population it resides within , on the basis of human rights , you run the danger of ultimately subverting the core values of that society to the minorities ' position .
anthony newstead , london , uk i ca n't understand why this is causing such a huge problem .
the head scarf is compulsory for women , but i ca n't see why the colour of such scarves can not match the school uniform .
it worked well at my school .
france is taking an extreme view by banning them altogether ; however i feel that european human rights law may have the last say .
t shafiq , london , uk i admire the french education system for one reason and that is that after the revolution it was decided that education should be free of all religious influences .
this is now being enforced and does not reflect badly on the muslim people within france itself .
the removal of all religion in our schools should have been done years ago , teaching the basics of all religions as a social science .
derek , east kilbride , uk he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves lorraine , st albans a friend teaching in a bradford girls ' school with a high proportion of muslim children noted that many girls arrived with traditional headscarves and wearing trousers under their skirts but then immediately took them off so that they looked ' western ' during school hours .
my friend was also aware that he could keep discipline simply by warning any of these girls that if they misbehaved he would tell their parents about the removal of the scarves and thus they risked finishing their education in stricter muslim schools in pakistan .
it seems that school for some children already represents freedom from the constraints of their religious traditions .
it also seems that not all muslim girls are happy being expected to look so different from their friends .
lorraine , st albans , uk no , it should n't be banned - however one looks at it , this is a breach of personal freedom .
equally , an atheist should be able to wear clothing declaring " god / allah / deity-of-choice does n't exist " on the front .
what is utterly unacceptable is that headscarves / skullcaps etc are allowed if one claims allegiance to a religion , but not if one just likes wearing them .
gordon , uk i think the french parliament is correct to enforce this ban - france is a very secular society , and it is their culture not to have outward signs of religion associated with the state .
if people are going to immigrate to france from a religious , islamic state , then they have to accept that - if you want to live in an islamic state , do n't emigrate to a secular one .
james , uk it is not the ban that discriminates .
it 's the religious signs that make children believe they are different even though they are not .
dominique , paris , france as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government leon , singapore as a muslim i have to say that if you are living in a country then you have to respect the decisions of the government .
at the end of the day it is not that you do not want to wear it but you do not have a choice and god will understand .
if we all understood each others religion and respected it as much as we respect our own religion then this world might just be a better place to be .
leon , singapore the head scarf is not forced on girls ; i wear one out of choice .
it is not a symbol of repression but a symbol of a tolerant society which would not object to a head scarf anymore than it does to trousers on women and longhair on men !
total freedom of expression .
nazni , united kingdom france is a secular state and the french people fought long and hard to make it such .
as a secular state religion of any kind has no place in the classroom and that means all religions .
this is fair and correct .
britain , however , has an official church and religion has long been a required element in the curriculum .
this has led to total nonsense in the classroom and divisions between schools and , indeed , segregation that is growing every day .
the church should be disestablished and schools should be secularised .
thomas priaulx , london uk if you wear a symbol of your faith then you should not be offended if others wear symbols of other faiths .
i believe that we should keep our religion private , and not show it off in order not to offend others or provoke others who have a less " enlightened " state of mind .
the choice whether to wear religious symbols should be left open for everyone to decide for themselves , for there is no right or wrong in this issue , only different points of view .
thomas , england how can france deprive individuals of their basic human rights such as religious belief and practice ?
this make s a mockery of europe if other countries follow suit .
the french are displaying great ignorance in introducing these laws , it will make muslims more defiant .
asad choudhary , manchester , uk there should be no religious links or teaching in school .
teach it at home if needed .
how can we expect our children to not have pre-conceptions about different people if they are constantly told that " they " are different .
time to live together .
colin maciver , glasgow , scotland women and girls do not need to be told what they can and can not wear by their fathers , husbands , or their government .
if governments are truly interested in helping women achieve equality , they need to look beyond the veil .
kristin truse , princeton , us i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us as long as no one is forcing their religion down someone else 's throat then all should be well .
i do n't see how wearing a headscarf in obedience with your god 's wishes infringes on anyone .
christena luquis , ft worth , tx , us how can be said that the headscarf is a threat when it has been worn for nearly 1400 years ?
you ca n't change people minds by changing their clothes .
dundar durlanik , london the banning of headscarf by the french government is very encouraging .
one does not have to show to what religious group they belong to in a public place , it is private matter behind your close doors. br / > vinoo , london , uk islamic headscarves , sikh turbans , jewish caps ... who do they offend ?
everyone has a right to be proud of who they are and stand out in their own way ... and no government has the right to stop them .
we all have a constitutional right to freedom of expression .
shazia sharif , huddersfield , england it is very shameful to ban women from wearing scarf in school by the name of protecting secular society and freeing muslim women .
you are dictating to us freedom of living and at the same time you are telling us muslim women what to wear and not .
all muslims you have to prepare from now the hard life in europe because they start by preventing women and will come other similar issue after issue until you left completely your religion and convert like them .
mussa , eritrea european religious belief is in severe decline .
in the uk there are more muslims than attendants of the c of e. the hijab should be banned from school on the basis of respect for european mores and liberal values .
a friend teaches english language to muslim students at university .
progressively she has been asked by her students to draw exterior room blinds on the ground of modesty , not to teach mixed classes and recently , censorious remarks have been made about the fact that her ankles were visible .
is this the ' tolerance ' that we wish to observe ?
alan tayler , wivelsfield , uk let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy if there is a school uniform which is strictly adhered to , then of course no-one should wear a headscarf .
if there is no school uniform or one that is not used by everyone then the girls should be allowed to dress as they and or their families like , just as the others do .
let 's keep politics and religion out of the schools .
patricia giulietti , cattolica , italy how can we in the west prescribe to others what they should or should not wear ?
when i go to worship services , i wear a yarmulka -lrb- kippah -rrb- .
even though i do not wear it outside the place of worship , i wear it to show my respect for my heavenly father .
are we not overstepping the line here - what about an individual 's human rights ?
jim coetzee , port elizabeth , south africa the french assembly is absolutely right to pass this law .
for that country to work , and to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all groups , children from all backgrounds need to learn to be responsible members of the french republic above and beyond whatever else they may choose to believe or do in private .
those who ca n't accept this responsibility should move to other parts of world where society is organised more to their liking .
hats off to the government of france .
jonathan edwards , dubai , uae if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education jenny riley , scunthorpe my daughter , who is a university admissions officer and married to a muslim who is non-practising , says that if the girls are banned from wearing headscarves then they will not be allowed to benefit from a western-style education - they will have to stay at home .
jenny riley , scunthorpe there is a word : égalité .
those students can practice different religions in their temples , homes and of course in their hearts .
if the symbols are creating separation instead of diversity , it is time to stop them .
i agree with the decision made by the french republic .
elba beolchi , sydney , australia how can a ban on islamic headscarves be imposed in a democratic society ?
the french seem to be more than willing to act " on principle " when it suits their own worldwide political agenda , but on this major issue of personal choice they are acting like totalitarians .
john c , new york , usa its is interesting that in a democratic western world , we cherish the rights and freedoms that we want to give to others , only to make everyone the same and disregard the rights and freedoms that our countries live and die by .
the headscarves do not hurt anyone nor offend anyone .
rich , covina , ca , usa according to the french , religion has no place in public life .
so why are they very publicly debating and banning what is , in effect , a very insignificant intrusion of religion in schools ?
a smith , london schools are there to educate children .
religion is a personal thing which should be kept just that .
the only exception could be in church schools .
cazz , n ireland no good will come of this ban .
bill , colchester , usa banning is probably the wrong word .
standard dress code avoiding all religious symbols and inappropriate undress probably fits the bill .
tim rollinson , tonbridge , uk ironically this bill might even increase the amount of teenagers wearing headscarves .
in fact i 'll bet that even non muslim children will wear a headscarf as a sign of rebellion .
vive la difference !
ryan nielson , limerick , ireland no .
but maybe they should ban open bellies and mini skirts which seem to have become acceptable in london 's schools .
mrs bowes , london , uk as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear maureen , the netherlands when i was at school i had to wear a uniform like everyone else at school whether we were rich , poor or whatever the religion , so we all looked the same .
as soon as my friends and i came home from school we all changed back into the clothes we liked to wear , so why ca n't the same be done with headscarves ?
maureen , the netherlands first , those who try to draw parallels with wearing mini-skirts in middle eastern countries are completely missing the point .
if the bible supported the wearing of mini-skirts , it might be valid , but it does n't !
jim , ottawa , canada with all due respect to the muslim culture , i agree with the ban .
when western people visit islam states they are expected to cover up in accordance with islamic law .
should n't the islamic community respect our culture and the way we live , rather than worrying that their women should prefer not to wear the hijab .
lisa drew , northampton , england i do n't think headscarves and other religious symbols should be banned in school , we should not practise what we supposedly condemn in arab countries .
it is intolerance otherwise we are nothing but hypocrites .
john sterianos , south african living in london , uk i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to stuart w , uk a school uniform policy should not make concessions for religious beliefs .
i could n't have worn a bowler hat at school had i wanted to , nor should some be allowed headscarves .
stuart w , uk if religion is kept separate from the state , then the state should keep out of religion .
how people dress , or adorn themselves is none of the state 's business .
michael a , camb , uk rather than being a sign of oppression , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam karla , new york city , usa i 'm a convert to islam , and i wear the headscarf by choice .
i do so because i believe it is god 's commandment to women .
rather than being a sign of oppression of women , it is , for me , a sign of respect - and the elevated status women have in islam .
karla , new york city , usa my worry about this ban is that muslim families will use this as an excuse to keep their daughters away from school , thus depriving them of any exposure to mainstream culture at all .
dave , oxford , uk why do so many muslim women say the headscarf is an issue of identity ?
is their identity so weak that they need it advertised at every moment ?
hasan , vancouver , canada france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion david m , st etienne , france i think that people are arguing about the wrong issue .
france is a secular state , which means that there is no more state religion , thank god .
in other words everybody is free to have the religion they want , or no religion at all .
the issue is not about them wearing headscarves , but about wearing them at school .
david m , st etienne , france sikhism requires men to wear turbans , as part of their religious beliefs - yet this has never been an issue for anyone .
what the french and german authorities really want , is to isolate muslims even further , no doubt fuelling more hatred and opposition towards the west .
az , bristol , uk old saying - when in rome .
as the muslims are living in france which is a secular country they should abide by our rules .
we would not go into an arab country and start wearing miniskirts .
dawn nicholls , france i think that france is justified in doing what it is doing because it is in accordance with their secular law .
however , that does not mean that it is a particularly intelligent political decision - by many it will be seen as a racist and discriminating law and may cause unrest in an area of the population that has been troubled in the past .
this decision may draw the line in the sand , but it may also encourage the throwing of rocks over that line .
christopher hogarty , oxford , uk britain is a multi-cultural society and we should be accepting cultural differences and religion in order to live together in a peaceful society .
the islamic faith deserves just as much respect as christianity .
headscarves should not be banned .
the lack of understanding between religious groups is the main cause of conflict in the world today .
people should be free to follow their faith .
janet , london , england this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out aliya , uae headscarves should not be banned .
why is it that western people are outraged by muslim girls wearing a headscarf but tolerate women wearing skimpy clothes ?
as for those of you who commented that the headscarf is a sign of " oppression " please wake up ! !
i am a muslim woman -lrb- who not only wears a scarf but also wears a complete veil over the rest of the body -rrb- and i study , work , drive , go out and do things what other western women my age do .
my headscarf doe not oppress me .
in fact it frees me from the unwanted advances and sexual harassment faced by many western women .
this ban will achieve nothing except that headscarf-wearing girls will drop out and maybe some people will open schools for muslims only .
if the french government thinks that it will integrate the muslim by this law , they will be proved wrong .
aliya , uae if headscarves are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
then why do n't the men wear them ?
the answer is that under islam women are oppressed .
these young school girls are not given a choice .
this is what the islamic men are really scared about , their loss of control .
john , pinner uk good on the french , we are just too scared to impose such a sensible idea as we are terrified of offending anyone .
noel , london , uk i travelled to dubai a few years ago , but had to change at abu dhabi .
at the airport , a female colleague was marched off at gunpoint by two female guards and ordered to cover herself up in order to " maintain dignity " .
at the time , i felt it was a bit harsh , but respected their culture nonetheless .
it certainly seems that this is rarely a two-way process .
richard , uk since schools are the place where factual information should be imparted to our children i find it entirely appropriate that they should be stripped of all overt religious signs .
it is healthy for society at large that the human mind to be freed of myth and misinformation , as these are intellectual cul-de-sacs that serve only to foster distrust , fear and hatred of those who do n't share their beliefs .
the history of humanity drips with the bloodshed in the name of ignorance and the blind faith of those who ' know ' they are right .
james rae , england in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state james , paris france i do n't particularly agree with this law but i have to say that the way british and international press have covered the subject has been really badly explained and not always informative towards the people .
not once has it been mentioned in this article that france has a history of laicity in its schools .
it 's not recent .
it has been going on for nearly a 100 years .
in 1905 the french state decided that religion was a private domain and should not interfere with the state .
this laicity was set up because of the thought of religion interfering with politics seemed a little archaic and should stay in the past .
little did we know at the time that the world would n't have evolved a bit in a 100 years , and that religion is still at the centre point of most wars that have taken place in the 20th and 21st century .
i think french people think that schools and children should be spared and that all kids should be able to start their lives on an equal level .
now whether it helps the integration of the various religious groups , i 'm not sure !
james , paris france i agree that no one should be forced to wear a headscarf or other religious symbol , but at the same time i do not think any one should be forced to not wear such items .
i recently heard a discussion regarding this topic and the statement that stuck with me was that this was to help france be a secular society , it sounds more like they are looking for homogeny .
fred hooper , massachusetts , usa as far as i see it being a foreigner who for his whole life has lived outside his home country , you have to respect the laws and traditions of the country you live in .
add to that that the koran does not impose the veil only modest clothing and that france has a tradition of being much more frank and direct than the uk also the french have no qualms about being politically incorrect something britain sadly lacks , britain has become obsessed with being pc and has a situation where minorities dictate to the majority what can and can not be done mats e , nottingham this is not just a ban on islamic headscarves - it is a ban on all overt display of religious items whatever the faith .
so it can not be something that is simply anti-islamic .
it is , in fact , anti-religion , whatever the religion happens to be .
the law affects the wearing of jewish headwear and christian crucifixes as much as it does the wearing of the hijab .
helen s , uk people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims ng , london , uk some people seem to forget that france is a secular country .
this ban is not just on the hijab , it is for all religious symbols in state schools .
these rules should be imposed because as a secular country france has the right to .
people need to understand that this is not an attack on muslims - this is upholding the beliefs / rules of a secular country .
try going to a muslim country and not covering up when necessary - try going to a hindu temple and not removing your shoes and washing your feet !
you have to respect the rules of a country / religion .
if you choose to live in a secular country then you are obliged to follow its rules - there are no exceptions !
ng , london , uk headscarves should not be banned , as they are part of what every woman and grown up girls should do in islam , so banning them will prevent muslim ladies from following one of the rules of their religion .
this makes it different from wearing a large cross or the head cap .
mahmoud el-haridy , cairo , egypt no , they should not be banned .
to do so would be disgraceful .
it is awful that france has felt it has the right to do so .
it seems to me that the best point of a secular state is that it should stay out of religious matters and be tolerant of all religions .
banning headscarves , and other outward religious symbols , is not tolerant , it is an interference with peoples right to their own beliefs .
schools are places where tolerance ought to be taught .
louise , redditch uk having listened to speeches in the french parliament on c-span , it is clear to me that what the french are really concerned about is a demographic shift towards an unintegrated moslem minority in their country .
it will take a lot more than a ban on headscarves in public schools to stop it .
mark , usa i hesitate to voice an opinion because supporting a ban on headscarves could lead to me being branded a racist .
however , in the interests of equality and the promotion of good citizenship through discipline , i believe in having school uniforms that all children must wear without exception or deviation .
bruce jones , liverpool , england to argue that the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance is ludicrous .
it is an extremely visible sign by which they are instantly judged - as a good muslim , an oppressed woman , someone following a cultural custom , or a religious nutter .
however the individual doing the judging perceives them .
simon dunsby , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone peter shiner , london , uk it is not for a government to impose secular ideals on anyone , nor impose religious ones either .
the government must rather ensure that there is mutual respect for all beliefs and that people are free to make their own decisions without pressure , either from a religion or a secular authority .
a ban on headscarves can not be right unless there is clear evidence that they are being forced on children against their will .
peter shiner , london , uk france has much more severe racial problems than the uk , and this is another symbol of intolerance .
most britons can see a woman in a headscarf without feeling shocked by the sight .
by the way , does n't the human rights charter have something to say on the subject ?
herbert , leeds , uk many years ago my father worked in saudi arabia and whenever my mother and i visited we had to be appropriately attired according to the law and custom of that country - there were no ifs or buts .
as women we were not even allowed to go outside alone .
its time muslims followed the rules and regulations of their host country .
what was good for me in the middle east is good for muslims living in the west .
i say well done to france for having the courage , hopefully others will follow suit janeen , usa -lrb- american married to a frenchman -rrb- of course the hijab should not banned in schools .
i do however find it ironic that in western europe women are battling for the right to wear the headscarf , whilst women in islamic countries like kuwait are fighting for the right not to have to wear the hijab .
jamie reeves , hounslow secularity is as much a modern religion as are other religions , so i do n't think it is right for the french government to stop people living the way they want .
the decisions of what children wear should ultimately be up to their parents and not the government .
rav singh , portsmouth the french state schools aim to be fair to all , no uniforms , no special treatment for one group or another .
keep it that way and let people after school age or out of school hours wear what they like .
tim lock , netherlands if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i think they should ban the hijab .
even though this ban will halt the rise of the hijab in state schools , the religious schools will still exist and probably be more extreme against the french culture than at current levels .
if chirac wanted to preserve secularity then he should have proposed banning the hijab in all educational institutions , not just state controlled schools .
kalpesh patel , leicester , uk i just ask those who are in favour of ban .
how is this scarf bothering you personally ?
please let us know .
sohail m rizki , houston , tx usa to rizki , houston : this is how the headscarf bothers me personally .
i work in a french university where more and more students wear headscarves .
some , in another department , wear burkas and this , to the mighty sorbonne .
this means that far from being an expression of the modesty of the muslim woman , they stand out like sore thumbs .
so far i have seen no jewish symbols and no christian ones in five years of teaching here .
far from being a sign of muslim modesty , the headscarf has become an open provocation in a nation which is officially secular .
malcolm mansfield , paris , france france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england france is no better than the taleban regime in afghanistan .
both are / were dictating to people what they can or can not wear , and taking away people 's freedom and choice .
when i went to school , my classmates were from many religions and cultures .
being able to express themselves was all part of the educational experience , as i was able to learn and understand about other people 's religions and cultures .
ignorance is far worse , as it creates unfounded fears and barriers which lead to racism .
nicola fitzgerald , chichester , england a ban on headscarves would be a basic breach of human rights .
sumiya hemsi , dundee , scotland in islam traditionally a child comes of age at seven , hence girls are encouraged to wear a scarf from that age onwards .
nowadays in france -lrb- i assume -rrb- the coming of age is 16 plus .
muslims -lrb- including myself -rrb- need to come to terms with the fact that times change and islam is not set in stone , we can adapt .
the french have a problem - start talking with each other and solve the problem .
but do n't dictate and follow the route of islamic states .
perhaps the compromise is to wear the scarf to school and remove on school premises .
naveeda mitchell , london , uk the french are actually proposing to ban all religious symbols from schools - that includes crosses , skull caps - the lot .
why has the debate only focused on how it affects muslims , when clearly it would affect all religions ?
clearly it should be a point of unity for the different religions- that would make a change !
andy , bristol , uk the main purpose of the hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa headscarves are not a mere religious symbol , they are a necessary part of the islamic faith .
the main purpose of hijab is that women are not judged by their appearance , but by their character .
abubakar abdu , mwanza tanzania , east africa the french authorities are only doing what the authorities in the uk are so scared of even thinking about .
stephen , york , uk first of all , let 's all be clear that we are not talking about " women " , we are talking about girls - minors who have not yet come into their full decision-making rights .
in public schools , not everywhere .
and we are talking about all religious symbols , not just the hijab .
this is not about the west versus islam , and nor should it be .
i would point out though that calling the hijab an " essential part of islam " is nonsense - there 's not requirement in the koran for women to wear them , just for all muslims to clothe themselves modestly .
katherine , london , uk women should be free to decide what they want - or not - to wear .
headscarves are a symbol of oppression in most muslim countries and also in other parts of the world since they often go along with the impossibility for muslim women to act freely in their everyday life : visiting the doctor , attending biology classes at school ...
consol , catalonia if most french people support the headscarf ban , then the headscarf should be banned .
after all , this is a french matter .
lana , lebanon it 's very simple .
if you wish to live in france , obey french laws and traditions .
the french secular state is engrained in the history and culture of france .
this is just another case of the minority attempting to impose its will on the majority .
ben dobbyn , london , uk i think adults should be allowed to dress as they please .
but we are talking here about schoolchildren .
if school uniform rules state no headscarves , then no headscarves should be worn in that school .
once a child gets to school leaving age -lrb- i.e. 16 in the uk -rrb- , they should be allowed to wear what they wish as responsible adults , even if still studying .
helen , worcester the argument seems to be more about frenchness than islam .
surely a french muslim has as much right as a french non-muslim to have a say in what it means " to be french " .
julian , uk no .
how are we going to live in a multi-cultural world if we ban the right to be different ?
palwinder sangha , london whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did megan , plymouth i have travelled extensively and always respected that country .
whilst in the middle east i was at times ordered to cover up which i did -lrb- no choice really -rrb- but felt uncomfortable doing so .
however that is their rules so i did it .
we are a christian country and respect for us should be given .
i do n't like to see all these women covered up and it does create barriers .
megan , plymouth no , it is wrong to ban islamic headscarves and other religious signs in schools .
such a move will alienate , rather than integrate , communities .
amer al-fadhil , muscat , oman when in rome do as the romans do !
try visiting a muslim country and not respecting their values !
it works -lrb- or it 's supposed to do -rrb- both ways .

for the last 15 years the crimestoppers 0800 555 111 line has operated only during office hours .
but with new technology at its pacific quay base in glasgow , the service is now able to handle round-the-clock calls in a bid to solve more crimes .
justice minister cathy jamieson , who officially launched the service , said it was a valuable anti-crime resource .
double the calls " communities have had enough of crime .
they want to be safe and feel safe , " she said .
" but it 's not always easy to report a crime or criminals .
over the past 15 years crimestoppers scotland has proved to be an increasingly valuable resource for the police and other agencies working to deliver a safer , stronger scotland . "
those who operate the hotline are hoping to double the number of calls they receive and in turn the police hope to solve more crimes . "
crimestoppers will allow members of the public the ability to speak with an experienced police officer at any time , day or night " andrew brown scro ms jamieson said she believed the expanded service would leave criminals with " nowhere to hide " .
the crimestoppers call centre used to run from the strathclyde police hq at pitt street in glasgow .
but it moved to the new scottish criminal record office -lrb- scro -rrb- at pacific quay when upgraded technology was installed .
andrew brown , chairman of scro 's executive committee and the chief constable of grampian police , said the scottish public had shown their support for crimestoppers for many years .
" through their efforts , individuals involved in many types of criminality have been brought to justice .
" public confidence in the scheme is highlighted by the year on year increase in calls that continue to be made , " he said .
drug seizures " crimestoppers will allow members of the public the ability to speak with an experienced police officer at anytime , day or night . "
last year , the number of calls to the confidential telephone line rose by 23 % on the previous year .
some 7,800 of those calls were passed to scottish police forces for action , leading to the detection of 836 crimes .
calls to the number also helped with the recovery of stolen property worth £ 590,000 and the seizure of drugs valued at £ 244,000 .
two firearms were also seized as a result of phone calls and almost £ 2,000 was paid out last year in rewards to callers .
