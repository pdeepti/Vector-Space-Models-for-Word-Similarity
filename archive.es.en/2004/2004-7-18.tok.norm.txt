to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .

industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .

" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .

intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .

theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .

francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2004 treading new and risky ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking the narrow line between taste and disrespect students at the bauhaus university in weimar have tackled a project that until now no one had seriously contemplated : what sort of souvenir could you sell at a concentration camp ? apart from a few books , some post cards and the memory of the bare , haunting swath of hilltop that once served as the backdrop for holocaust crimes , there 's little a visitor can take home from the site of the former buchenwald concentration camp .
beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .

the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.07.2004 germany mulls adoption for gay couples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jersey already allows gay couples to adopt children while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .
convincing society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , right , and axel blumenthal , head of the gay and lesbian association of germany , at a 2002 constitutional court hearing that upheld registered partnerships .
but volker beck , a parliamentarian for the green party and a vocal advocate of gay and lesbian issues , said that there are over a million single mothers raising children in germany .
the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .
" society has to be convinced first and that could take either months or years , " he said .
katrin kühler , lucas ' second mom , said she is worried about the future .
" i could lose him , that is definitely the biggest fear , " she said .
" that something could happen to francesca and somehow , some person would come and say , ' you do n't have a right , he 's not your son , forget about it .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .

the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .

the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf .

but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .

however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless .

however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2004 treading new and risky ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking the narrow line between taste and disrespect students at the bauhaus university in weimar have tackled a project that until now no one had seriously contemplated : what sort of souvenir could you sell at a concentration camp ? apart from a few books , some post cards and the memory of the bare , haunting swath of hilltop that once served as the backdrop for holocaust crimes , there 's little a visitor can take home from the site of the former buchenwald concentration camp .
beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .

unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.07.2004 germany mulls adoption for gay couples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jersey already allows gay couples to adopt children while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .
convincing society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , right , and axel blumenthal , head of the gay and lesbian association of germany , at a 2002 constitutional court hearing that upheld registered partnerships .
but volker beck , a parliamentarian for the green party and a vocal advocate of gay and lesbian issues , said that there are over a million single mothers raising children in germany .
the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .
" society has to be convinced first and that could take either months or years , " he said .
katrin kühler , lucas ' second mom , said she is worried about the future .
" i could lose him , that is definitely the biggest fear , " she said .
" that something could happen to francesca and somehow , some person would come and say , ' you do n't have a right , he 's not your son , forget about it .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .

" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .

theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .

the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .

the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally .

the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .

the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .

buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .

intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .

theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.07.2004 germany mulls adoption for gay couples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jersey already allows gay couples to adopt children while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .
convincing society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , right , and axel blumenthal , head of the gay and lesbian association of germany , at a 2002 constitutional court hearing that upheld registered partnerships .
but volker beck , a parliamentarian for the green party and a vocal advocate of gay and lesbian issues , said that there are over a million single mothers raising children in germany .
the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .
" society has to be convinced first and that could take either months or years , " he said .
katrin kühler , lucas ' second mom , said she is worried about the future .
" i could lose him , that is definitely the biggest fear , " she said .
" that something could happen to francesca and somehow , some person would come and say , ' you do n't have a right , he 's not your son , forget about it .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .

he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally .

the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .

" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .

francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2004 treading new and risky ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking the narrow line between taste and disrespect students at the bauhaus university in weimar have tackled a project that until now no one had seriously contemplated : what sort of souvenir could you sell at a concentration camp ? apart from a few books , some post cards and the memory of the bare , haunting swath of hilltop that once served as the backdrop for holocaust crimes , there 's little a visitor can take home from the site of the former buchenwald concentration camp .
beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .

the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2004 treading new and risky ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking the narrow line between taste and disrespect students at the bauhaus university in weimar have tackled a project that until now no one had seriously contemplated : what sort of souvenir could you sell at a concentration camp ? apart from a few books , some post cards and the memory of the bare , haunting swath of hilltop that once served as the backdrop for holocaust crimes , there 's little a visitor can take home from the site of the former buchenwald concentration camp .
beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .

a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .

for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed button souvenir other students used germany 's postwar constitution as inspiration , copying quotations from the paragraphs dealing with human rights onto small plaques , or wristbands .
one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf . " i think everyone has a different way of looking at this .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.07.2004 germany mulls adoption for gay couples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jersey already allows gay couples to adopt children while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .
convincing society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , right , and axel blumenthal , head of the gay and lesbian association of germany , at a 2002 constitutional court hearing that upheld registered partnerships .
but volker beck , a parliamentarian for the green party and a vocal advocate of gay and lesbian issues , said that there are over a million single mothers raising children in germany .
the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .
" society has to be convinced first and that could take either months or years , " he said .
katrin kühler , lucas ' second mom , said she is worried about the future .
" i could lose him , that is definitely the biggest fear , " she said .
" that something could happen to francesca and somehow , some person would come and say , ' you do n't have a right , he 's not your son , forget about it .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz has not and will not sell souvenirs " -lrb- visitors -rrb- take away memories , or emotions , or photographs , maybe , " jarek mensfelt , of the auschwitz-birkenau museum , told dw-world .
" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .
" i wanted to pull a person out of this mass of people and numbers , and i wanted to pick a photo that the victim themselves would have picked , " she said .

one used the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site as a metaphor , creating a simple , clear button pin with ' buchenwald ' inscribed on it .
the right generation for the job tom hanke , a 23-year-old design student , planted sprigs of buche , or beech tree , that is the camp 's namesake in small pots that can be taken home by visitors .
after some initial wariness , he too said he came around to the idea of providing visitors something tangible to bring home from the camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanke 's souvenir idea is a beech tree sprig planted in a small pot " sometimes not just the knowledge , but the feeling that you have -lrb- in buchenwald -rrb- is easier to translate into an object than into writing , " he said .
theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .
the past and their responsibility to remember remains a weight on today 's generations , but not one heavy enough to deny them the necessary distance needed to work pragmatically on the project .
" we 're the third generation , we are not the ones directly affected and that simply changes the way you think about it , " said stefan unholtz , who created an anti-fascist sticker that one can put over neo-nazi graffiti .
unanswered questions there are still a number of questions that remain , such as what the souvenirs will look like in their final form and where and how they will be displayed .
the biggest question of them all - will anyone buy them - wo n't get answered before next year .
but theuerkauf is optimistic .
" maybe one person will put the souvenir on their desk , another person will put in a drawer , yet another may carry it out around with them in their pocket , " said theuerkauf .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .

buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .

11 terrorist attacks are reportedly to be dropped because german prosecutors are concerned some us evidence may have come from torture . according to the british paper the observer , german authorities will no longer try to put mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan living in the northern port city of hamburg , behind bars for aiding al qaeda terrorists before they crashed hijacked airplanes into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington in 2001 . motassadeq had been convicted on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 .
but he was freed from his 15-year prison term in april after being granted a retrial .
the court said defense attorneys for motassadeq should have access to interrogation records from alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , who are currently in us custody . and that 's where the trouble for prosecutors starts , since german courts can not accept evidence if it is thought to come under duress or torture .
a senior german intelligence official reportedly told the observer that the inability to prove the testimony was admissible would make it worthless . " they contain no details as to where binalshibh and mohammed were questioned , nor whether torture or other forms of force were used to make them talk , " he said , saying german courts would be extremely tough after the abu ghraib prison torture scandal in iraq .
" their contents may be information and they may be disinformation . " a strain on us-german ties the latest legal difficulties could strain ties between german and us authorities , who have been irked by germany 's inability to make progress against motassadeq and others linked to the hamburg terror cell .
for their part , the germans have been frustrated by us reluctance to supply the evidence in the first place . the intelligence official said german authorities were now only hoping to convict motassadeq for membership in a terrorist organization .
however , that would likely not carry a jail sentence for longer than the two and a half years the moroccan has already served prior to being granted his retrial , which was expected to start in august . motassadeq 's lawyer josef graessle-münscher told the paper he was confident the court would not accept the testimony gathered from us interrogations . " in germany , any use of force to produce a statement is unlawful , " said graessle-münscher .
" after abu ghraib , if the americans want to see motassadeq convicted for 9/11 they are going to have to prove both binalshibh and mohammed are in good health , and that they say motassadeq was a conspirator . " earlier this month , authorities in hamburg served motassadeq and another moroccan allegedly linked to the al qaeda cell , abdelghani mzoudi , notice that they would be deported after their legal matters were resolved .
mzoudi was acquitted in february , shortly before motassadeq was granted a retrial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .

to help defuse a growing labor dispute over longer working hours for employees , top managers at carmaker daimlerchrysler appear ready to accept large salary cuts .
the company had threatened to move jobs to save costs . a day after striking workers shut down daimlerchrysler plants in sindelfingen and untertürkheim to protest the company 's attempts to squeeze labor costs , the carmaker 's board members signaled they would sacrifice part of their own pay if workers agreed to a longer workweek .
the bild am sonntag newspaper reported the top executives had offered to take a 10 percent cut in salary . daimlerchrysler spokesman thomas fröhlich could not confirm a figure that board members were willing to accept , but he said they were in principle ready to consider such a measure so long as the labor dispute was resolved . " i can confirm that the board wants to do its part in the context of an overall solution , " fröhlich told the reuters news agency on sunday . production at daimlerchrysler 's two factories in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg was halted on saturday , as almost 15,000 workers downed their tools to protest the company 's attempts to get employees to work longer hours without compensation . the labor conflict was sparked last week after daimlerchrysler 's threatened to shift production of its new mercedes c-class sedan away from sindelfingen to bremen and south africa if unions do not agree to trim € 500 million -lrb- $ 615 million -rrb- in labor costs .
such a move could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs in sindelfingen . heated rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employees of the daimlerchrysler branch in sindelfingen demonstrating .
industrial trade union ig metall slammed the move as " blackmail " and railed workers to strike .
some along the picket line had signs with slogans such as " it 's war ! "
the escalating rhetoric between labor and management alarmed german chancellor gerhard schröder to the point that on friday he felt he needed to urge both sides to continue working for a resolution of the dispute . schröder said the heated atmosphere was " an example of the loss of a culture that i still believe in , that is that those involved do n't insult each other publicly and both sides certainly do n't threaten one another . " daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp told the welt am sonntag news paper that he expected a resolution " soon " and that both sides were engaged in constructive negotiations . the latest efforts by daimlerchrysler come as several big german firms look for ways to lower their labor costs .
foremost among the measures is the attempt to move workers back to a 40-hour workweek . last month , siemens said it would not to move thousands of jobs to hungary after unions agreed to abandon its 35-hour workweek .
that deal has led several other german companies , heavy truck maker man , to debate similar changes . a responsibility to employees ? the head of schröder 's social democratic party , franz müntefering , on saturday accused company bosses of trying to take advantage of the moment to pressure unions and workers .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper he said firms had a responsibility to their employees that precluded them from callously changing their production sites . " the way they are taking is wrong .
germany 's future does not lie with cheap wages , " müntefering said .
" we have to avoid ending up with blind , total capitalism . " however , angela merkel , the head of the conservative opposition , took a much more sanguine look at the growing discussion over labor costs .
she told the newspaper that it was only logical for daimlerchrysler to seek locations that offered the company lower production costs .
she also warned the unions against seeking wage increases that were too high and would make german companies less competitive globally . " in light of globalization there is a real danger that wage deals that could cause more production to be moved abroad , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive strikes at daimlerchrysler tens of thousands of employees of german-u.s. car giant daimlerchrysler are expected to down tools thursday in a day of protest against management 's cost-cutting plans .

beginning next year , that could change .
souvenirs and mementos created by design students at the nearby bauhaus university in weimar are slated to start appearing in the museum gift shop in time for a memorial service next year marking 60 years since the camp 's liberation .
the souvenir project , a collaboration between the association that runs the buchenwald site and museum and the university , is designed to bring much-needed money into the association 's coffers while breaking controversial new ground .
" there have been no other camps that have undertaken something like this , " olaf theuerkauf , who heads the buchenwald association , said in an interview with dw-world .
" probably because nobody trusted themselves enough . "
running the risk of frivolity successive generations of germans have learned to remember the crimes of the holocaust with a mixture of guilt and reflection .
the subject is handled with delicacy in german classrooms and in countless books and documentaries.the concentration camp sites themselves are intentionally void of any sort of commercialization .

" we do n't have something like pencils with auschwitz printed on it and we do n't intend to .
it would mean commercializing it . "
buchenwald officials felt the same way until visitors began asking them if they had any plans to sell mementos or small souvenirs in their gift shop .
the query sparked a discussion between the association and the bauhaus design school that led to the creation of a 12-week long course .
" i was curious to see the young students ' discussions , how they approached the subject , how they got close to it … and at what point they might overstep their boundaries , " said theuerkauf .
he said he was open to the possibility that nothing might come out of it .
many of the students felt the same way .
" i was skeptical that you could even make something like a souvenir .
for me , everything that can hurt a person is taboo , " sabine hipp , 21 , told dw-world at an exhibition of the students ' work in weimar last week .
intimacy with the subject theuerkauf and professors at the university began by taking the class on a three-day intensive tour of buchenwald .
they pored over the concentration camp 's archive , heard lectures on what had happened at the site and gathered first impressions , many of which led to some of the first souvenir ideas .
hipp created a small booklet featuring a black and white photo of one of the victims in pre-camp times and their life story , gleaned from the camp 's archives .
the pamphlet , which was among the objects slated for possible sale , is designed to accompany the visitor throughout the concentration camp .

theuerkauf said this generation of germans was perhaps the best suited to tackle such a emotional project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.07.2004 germany mulls adoption for gay couples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jersey already allows gay couples to adopt children while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 . in 2001 , germany passed a law giving gay and lesbian couples some of the rights heterosexual couples have .
the law included such things as inheritance and tenants ' rights and foreign partners of a german gained the right to take on german citizenship .
however , the registered partnership law did n't satisfy everyone since it did n't give homosexual couples the tax benefits married people enjoy , nor did it address the controversial issue of adoption .
now the german government has announced it will expand the registered partnership law .
the plans include allowing stepchild adoptions , where gay men or lesbians co-adopt the child of their partner .
the idea is testing the limits of societal acceptance of gays and lesbians in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays have been able to register their partnerships with the german state since 2001 .
starting on january 1 , 2005 , gay and lesbian couples , who have entered into a registrierte lebenspartnerschaft , or registered life-partnership , will have new pension rights , can get officially engaged , and can be required to pay alimony to a partner if the relationship breaks up .
a stabilizing force for children francesca agostini and katrin kühler live in berlin with their five-year-old son , lucas .
francesca is the biological mother and earns her money as a pediatric dentist .
" to have a son was not my idea , it was actually a joint idea , " she said .
" we both decided to do this and both decided how to do this and he was born by artificial insemination . "
the couple decided to have a child when they were living in texas some time ago .
although no gay partnerships yet exists in that conservative state , francesca and katrin were able to draw up legal forms that gave katrin guardianship rights when it came to lucas .
when they returned to germany two years ago though , katrin suddenly had no legal connection to the child at all .
that is what the new law aims to change , since once katrin and francesca became registered partners , it would allow katrin to adopt lucas and have the full legal rights of a parent .
supporters of the change say the law will be a stabilizing force for the thousands of children who already live in gay or lesbian households .
conservatives outraged but according to many others , that aims of the new law are something that should not be encouraged , especially not by the state .
the stepchild adoption proposal has outraged conservatives , who say it tears at the very fabric of what family is about , and puts children in an environment that could be harmful to them .
norbert röttgen , a christian democratic member of parliament and spokesmen for the conservatives on legal issues , said his party will fight the new law , going to the country 's high court if necessary .
" we do n't know how homosexual relationships affect children , " he said .
" that 's a big risk that one takes .
you 're on safer ground if you place children up for adoption with married couples " .
convincing society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , right , and axel blumenthal , head of the gay and lesbian association of germany , at a 2002 constitutional court hearing that upheld registered partnerships .
but volker beck , a parliamentarian for the green party and a vocal advocate of gay and lesbian issues , said that there are over a million single mothers raising children in germany .
the traditional ideas about the nuclear family just are n't very current , he added .
for beck , the stepchild adoption proposal does n't go far enough .
he wants to push for a law opening up general adoptions to homosexuals , instead of limiting it to one partner 's biological child .
but he said germany probably is n't quite ready for that .
" society has to be convinced first and that could take either months or years , " he said .
katrin kühler , lucas ' second mom , said she is worried about the future .
" i could lose him , that is definitely the biggest fear , " she said .
" that something could happen to francesca and somehow , some person would come and say , ' you do n't have a right , he 's not your son , forget about it .

the changing drinking habits of women are of particular concern , with the number consuming over the safe limit having more than doubled .
the home secretary was speaking to the observer newspaper ahead of the publication of his department 's five-year strategy on violent crime .
new crime figures are to show a rise in ' violence against the person ' .
mr blunkett said the number of women drinking over the ' safe limit ' of 21 units per week had risen from 14 % to 33 % .
he told the newspaper pub culture was changing and women were no longer exerting the good influence they had tended to in the past .
' respect ' " they may be the ones who countenance it rather than calm it .
" it is not chauvinistic to say the presence of women has often been a calming influence , in terms of young men starting to lay about each other , " he told the observer .
the home secretary will launch a crackdown on anti-social behaviour when he launches the five-year violent crime strategy on monday .
the proposals are meant to provide a " clearer picture of the kind of thuggery and intimidation that is going on , " said mr blunkett .
but he said anger over anti-social behaviour was encouraging people to report incidences that would previously have been ignored as minor .
the way to tackle anti-social behaviour was to put " respect " back into communities , especially via parenting and families , he said .
the home secretary 's plans will reveal how he intends to meet a pledge to cut crime by 15 % , by 2008 .
the new target was set last week as part of the home office 's funding agreement with the treasury .
it will involve cutting 885,000 offences from the 5.9m recorded by police in england and wales in 2002-2003 .
more prison places ?
ministers have already revealed their funding will quadruple the number of civilian police wardens to 20,000 and maintain the record 138,000 police officers .
the plans for civilian wardens and community support officers -lrb- csos -rrb- have alarmed rank-and-file police officers , who opposed the creation of civilian ranks who do not swear an oath and have only limited powers to detain suspects .
the plan is also expected to include extra resources for projects offering activities such a sport and mentoring sessions for teenagers in high crime areas .
chancellor gordon brown said extra cash will also be spent on getting offenders off drugs so that 200,000 a year are in treatment by 2008 .
the document will address the whole range of home office responsibilities , including asylum , immigration and prisons .
it may also give detail on the setting up the serious and organised crime agency , which is to merge the national crime squad , national criminal intelligence service and investigation units at customs and excise .
more prison places are also expected to be announced , as are details of the next stages of the national identity card scheme .

the way to tackle anti-social behaviour was to put " respect " back into communities , especially via parenting and families , he said .
the home secretary 's plans will reveal how he intends to meet a pledge to cut crime by 15 % , by 2008 .
the new target was set last week as part of the home office 's funding agreement with the treasury .
it will involve cutting 885,000 offences from the 5.9m recorded by police in england and wales in 2002-2003 .
more prison places ?
ministers have already revealed their funding will quadruple the number of civilian police wardens to 20,000 and maintain the record 138,000 police officers .
the plans for civilian wardens and community support officers -lrb- csos -rrb- have alarmed rank-and-file police officers , who opposed the creation of civilian ranks who do not swear an oath and have only limited powers to detain suspects .
the plan is also expected to include extra resources for projects offering activities such a sport and mentoring sessions for teenagers in high crime areas .
chancellor gordon brown said extra cash will also be spent on getting offenders off drugs so that 200,000 a year are in treatment by 2008 .
the document will address the whole range of home office responsibilities , including asylum , immigration and prisons .
it may also give detail on the setting up the serious and organised crime agency , which is to merge the national crime squad , national criminal intelligence service and investigation units at customs and excise .
more prison places are also expected to be announced , as are details of the next stages of the national identity card scheme .

the changing drinking habits of women are of particular concern , with the number consuming over the safe limit having more than doubled .
the home secretary was speaking to the observer newspaper ahead of the publication of his department 's five-year strategy on violent crime .
new crime figures are to show a rise in ' violence against the person ' .
mr blunkett said the number of women drinking over the ' safe limit ' of 21 units per week had risen from 14 % to 33 % .
he told the newspaper pub culture was changing and women were no longer exerting the good influence they had tended to in the past .
' respect ' " they may be the ones who countenance it rather than calm it .
" it is not chauvinistic to say the presence of women has often been a calming influence , in terms of young men starting to lay about each other , " he told the observer .
the home secretary will launch a crackdown on anti-social behaviour when he launches the five-year violent crime strategy on monday .

the anniversary of the 1904 opening of the elan dam network by king edward vii , has prompted a series of events to celebrate a century of welsh water supply to the people of birmingham .
a commemorative statue will be unveiled in tribute to the men who built the dams , near rhayader .
other events include a talk about the official opening of the dams , a 15-mile hill walk taking in all six victorian structures , and an exhibition , in rhayader , called under the shadow of the dam .
in the process of flooding the valleys , the school , church , chapel , two squires ' houses , small farms and cottages disappeared elan valley historian , betty davies local historian betty davies , whose family had to make way for the dams , said : " as i look down at the vast tracks of water that are the dams of the elan valley , i can not help but wonder how my great grandparents felt when told they had lost the fight to save the valleys of nant cwilt and cwm elan .
" their land would be lost to them , as would the land of their friends and neighbours , in order to supply water for a far distant city .
could they envisage the changes to their way of life ?
" in the process of flooding the valleys , the school , church , chapel , two squires houses , small farms and cottages disappeared .
bodies had to be exhumed .
' commitment ' " the fact that they stayed , weathered the storms that came their way , kept working the land to provide for their children and their children 's children , so they grew and thrived , is a testament to their strength of character and to their commitment to the land they farmed . "
liz pugh , of community arts rhayader and district -lrb- carad -rrb- , who has worked on the centenary exhibition , said : " the exhibition itself is based on a reconstruction of the wooden village built by the birmingham city corporation .
the dam workers ' village in the elan valley " this village housed the workforce which spent 10 years constructing the dams . "
construction of the dams and reservoirs started in 1893 and involved a total of 50,000 people .
it cost £ 6m and more than 100 workers were killed during the building work .
more than 100 people in the valley also had to move to make way for the dams .
the project was carried out by birmingham council to provide a source of clean , safe , water for the growing population and industries of the city .
the elan valley reservoirs send 360 million gallons of water a day along a 70-mile pipeline to birmingham and also to parts of radnorshire and south wales .

the visitbritain organisation is using the film as the theme for the latest in its movie map series .
the map features locations linked with the arthurian legend and the scenes used in the film , including hadrian 's wall and tintagel castle in cornwall .
the film casts doubt on cornwall 's links to arthur by placing the legend of the ancient monarch in cumbria .
arthurian expert john matthews said : " in my opinion , the film comes closer to historical truth than any yet made .
myth and legend " it will be a reminder for many people that the legend of king arthur will always have its roots here in britain .
" the film will capture audiences ' imagination and inspire them to visit britain and discover more about the reality behind the man , the myth and the legend . "
the new film , which stars clive owen , keira knightley and ray winstone , portrays him as a roman soldier on hadrian 's wall .
tintagel in cornwall has built much of its tourist industry on the popular belief it was king arthur 's birthplace .
but the cumbria tourist board says the evidence is " overwhelming " that his real home was there .

former u.s. president , william jefferson clinton david frost : mr president , one of the most absorbing parts of " my life " is the story of negotiations which eventually failed with arafat and so on , on the middle east , and you write : " right before i left office , arafat thanked me for all my efforts and told me what a great man i was .
mr chairman , i replied , i am not a great man , i am a failure and you have made me a failure . "
bill clinton : yeah , i did n't mean that i was a failure all round but i meant that i had failed to get them to make a conference of peace .
and i thought arafat was making a terrible mistake .
i did n't know for sure , then , and frankly i do n't know for sure today , why he turned down the , the plan that i outlined .
because about a year after i left office he said he wanted it .
and by then he had a prime minister who would n't give it to him in israel and a government and a public in israel that did n't trust him any more .
david frost : but do you think he , he basically could n't give up being a revolutionary ?
bill clinton : i think that he psychologically found it very difficult to transfer from being a , the leader of the world 's great cause , being the world 's great victim , to running a state , a small state at that , and trying to solve the problems that were inherent in that , to join the israelis and all the other arab states in fighting regional terror , in trying to build a whole different future , a different mindset .
i think that is a lot of it .
i know that there are a number of people on this team who wanted to do the agreement and i , i believe to this day that it gave them 97 per cent or more of what they wanted and would have been , on balance , a huge advance for the palestinian people .
david frost : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- do you think israel is responsible for using too much , too much force ?
do you think , for instance , that sharon has made the right response to the international court of justice , saying that this wall is illegal ?
bill clinton : well it 's very difficult for him ... when the overwhelming majority of israelis want it because it 's worked in gaza .
i mean if you look at where they 've had the fence in gaza , deaths from terror have gone down .
so , you know , the way the israelis hear that is because it 's going to be unfair to some palestinian property owners and it seems to prejudge a final territorial settlement , you must continue to die .
your civilians must continue to die .
that 's the way this is being heard in israel .
the court decision , it 's like saying we want you to continue to be more exposed to terror , and it 's unfortunate that more of you will have to die but that 's the way we feel .
now that 's the way it 's heard in israel .
and i say this as someone who is very much in favour of a palestinian state , who believes that the palestinians have been horribly mistreated in the past , not just by occasional israeli governments but by other arab states who have ignored their plight or used them .
the thing i regret about the wall is different .
i think that any continued building the wall ought to be coupled with the withdrawal from gaza of israel .
second , i think the israelis ought to make it clear that they are more than willing to negotiate a final settlement , including turning the west bank back to the palestinians , and that whether there would be such a wall along the final border of israel would depend upon a mutual agreement and the capacity of the israelis and the new palestinian state to contain terror .
but , you know , i think the wall built on its own will not satisfy the israelis desire for peace and security .
by just leaving the wall down , when they evidence in gaza that it works to keep civilians alive , it 's a pretty hard argument to make to the israelis .
david frost : tell me mr president , you said to bob woodward , i would have preferred to have been president during the second world war - what was your thought in saying that ?
bill clinton : well i always thought of myself as sort of a world war ii person .
you know , great causes , and things were black and white , and it was a simpler time where people knew politics mattered .
but in my book i say in the epilogue something i came to believe very strongly , that i was very well suited by background experience and by psychology , it 's the way i think and feel , to be president when i was .
i have always been able to take apparently disparate events and put them together , and i get along well with all kinds of people .
so , i said that to woodward , i think in the beginning , because i always , i love the world war ii period , and i love the idea of being involved in a great endeavour .
but i think on balance i served when i should have served because i was well suited for it .
just like theodore roosevelt complained that he did n't have the civil war like abraham lincoln , but theodore roosevelt was quite wrong , he served us well when he did , he was the first president of the industrial age and he told us we were going to have to be a world power .
so he did a great thing , even though he did n't understand it or appreciate his own presidency at the time for how important it was .
david frost : and also , as you hinted at there , it 's difficult to be remembered as a great president if you have n't had to cope with a war .
bill clinton : i think in future times , you know these things they go through incarnations , the way we 're all evaluated .
when i was president there were two new biographies of general grant , lincoln 's commander in the civil war , who was great , rated always a great commander and a horrible president .
and these two new biographies sort of wrote him up as a president .
so , i think , you know , a hundred years from now , we may come to value the peacemakers more .
we may come to value the peacemakers more even sooner .
and we may , someday , come to give people credit for the bad things they stopped from happening , as well as the messes they cleaned up after they occur .
david frost : and if you had your time over again as president , you list in the book a number of triumphs and a number of a failures , but if there was one incident that you could rewrite or handle differently , what would that one be ?
bill clinton : well , if i could i would like to mention one at home , one abroad .
i wish i had moved in rwanda quickly .
i wish i had gone in there quicker , not just waited ' til the camps were set up .
we , we might have been able to save , probably not even half those who were lost but still a large number of people .
i really regret that .
i care a lot about africa and i do n't think that these ... wars are inevitable and these kinds of murders are inevitable .
and i 've spent a good deal of time in the last ten years trying to make it up to africa in general and the rwandans in particular - so i regret that deeply .
david frost : actually in fact in terms of aids too is something else where you and africa are closely intertwined .
bill clinton : yes - well david frost : and the fact , the fact that drug companies have reduced their prices , and so on , seems a bit of a miracle .
bill clinton : yeah it 's a great thing , you know , we 're now having , as we do this interview , they 're having the international aids conference in thailand .
two years ago , at that conference , i was asked by a number of countries , in the caribbean and africa , to help bring in medical teams to set up health care delivery networks .
so i agreed to do that .
and we 're now working in 13 caribbean , four african countries and in china .
then it occurred to me that a lot of these countries , they have per capita incomes of about a dollar a day .
back then the generic aids medicine was selling for around 500 dollars a year , as opposed to 11,000 in america .
so we negotiated the price down to 140 dollars a year - we cut the price by 70 per cent - and the world health organisation is supporting us , the global fund on aids , t.b and malaria is supporting us , we now have about 20 other countries buying medicine off this contract .
we could , if we could get it out there in a hurry , we could save a couple of million lives over the next few years .
it 's a huge , huge deal , and i 'm gratified that one of the countries i 'm trying to help is rwanda .
david frost : it comes full circle , yes .
in fact we did n't get your incident you would rewrite at home ...
bill clinton : the biggest change i think i would make is in my first two years .
i think we lost the congress in 1994 because i made more change and took on more tough decisions in a shorter amount of time than could be digested by the electorate .
and so i 'd made all these interest groups mad and the economy had n't had time to get better so the public , the american people gave the congress to the republicans .
and that , i think , was not good for america .
i got a lot done with the republican congress and we often worked closely together but i think i , if i had not lost the congress , we might have been able to get health care reform and we might have been able to get social security reform so that when the baby-boomers retire they wo n't be worried about imposing a big burden on their children , who should in turn be supporting their grandchildren instead of their parents .
david frost : well talking of events that maybe could have gone differently and so on , i hope you wo n't be disappointed when i tell you that i 'm only planning to ask a couple of questions on the subject of monica lewinsky because i feel you must be pretty talked out on it and - bill clinton : well that 's the thing that i - david frost : - our audience , our audience is probably heard out on it , as it were .
bill clinton : yeah .
david frost : so i just wanted ... you know one thing that 's come up since your book came out .
monica lewinsky was quoted for almost the first time saying that you 'd destroyed her life , that she had spent the last several years trying so hard to move on ... and she 'd be a wife and a mother - do you think you destroyed her life ?
bill clinton : no .
i think it 's terrible what happened to her but no i do n't .
i think it 's terrible the publicity she got , it 's terrible what kenneth starr did to her , it 's terrible that kenneth starr interrogated her mother but those , those things that were done to her were not done by me .
and i take responsibility for the mistakes i made but others have to take responsibility for mistakes they made .
and i think , you know , what , what i hope for her is that she will be able to escape this .
i mean it 's crazy , it 's like as andy warhol would say , " we all get our 15 minutes of fame " , but we have to decide whether that will define our lives or not .
and she has to make a different decision , she 's a smart good person and she can have a good life .
and , and , you know , she 's suffered a lot because she talked a lot about what happened to linda trip , and linda trip betrayed and kenneth starr abused her and the press played it up .
and , you know , then they all use it against me .
but they have to take responsibility for that , all them .
david frost : did you love her ?
bill clinton : no .
i do n't think that 's what that was about - on either side .
but i liked her very much .
i liked her very much .
i thought she was really a good-hearted , intelligent person and i wanted her to have a good life and i think that 's the one reason i continued to see her long after our , the improperness of the relationship was over .
david frost : tell me about the senate intelligence committee and the findings that the cia , in particular , was so wrong on the iraq war .
it said it went back longer than , longer than just the bush administration , that there had been these intelligence failings earlier , i wonder have you been thinking were there things on which i was ill-served by intelligence - as you look back - anything perhaps that you got blamed for maybe but that , or that you did n't get the intelligence perhaps you should have done ?
bill clinton : well i 'm - let me just mention two things .
first of all , i obviously have no way of knowing what the cia did or did n't say to president bush after i left office .
but what they said to me about iraq and weapons of mass destruction was far more limited than the case that was made to the american people .
i read those intelligence reports faithfully every day , i read a lot of other back-up intelligence , i had exhaustive conversations with george tenet on a regular basis .
what i was told was that there were unaccounted for stocks of chemical and biological weapons - that is , after the first gulf war in ' 91 was over , ... certified a volume of potential chemical and biological weapons , a few missiles , a few warheads , some nuclear laboratory capacity , nowhere near a bomb .
then , from that time forward , with the inspections process , every time we found something and destroyed , or took it away , we subtracted that from the original list .
far more weapons of mass destruction were destroyed in the inspection process than in the first gulf war .
now in 1998 , saddam hussein , trying to force the sanctions to be lifted , kicked the un inspectors out .
prime minister blair and i then ordered four days of bombing attacks - you may remember .
we did it on all the suspected sites .
then we did n't get back in .
so all i knew , and what the in , what the reports were , we could have destroyed everything there , we could have destroyed half , we could have destroyed nothing - we had no way of knowing .
we just knew there was unreported , there were still unaccounted for - that 's the proper word - unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical agents , a few missiles , a couple , a few warheads , and that could be weaponised with chemical or biological agents , and some laboratory capacity .
that 's all i knew .
so i do n't know that i should blame them about that .
the place that i was most frustrated was that after we had this first attack in 1998 on osama bin laden 's training camps - do you remember and we - david frost : yeah .
bill clinton : - uh sent the missiles in there , we were attempting to kill him and his top aides , there were three other occasions in which we were ready to strike .
and i was also prepared to order special forces in there if we had intelligence which would justify the risks .
and the pentagon strongly felt we never had enough intelligence to justify sending in the special forces .
and the three other times we were going to attack , in the end the attacks were called off because the cia said the intelligence was n't good enough .
david frost : what about the findings that you read about now ?
i mean when you read that the cia has been very mistaken and so on , do you blame , do you blame the intelligence service or do you blame the people who read the intelligence ?
or is it unfair to blame a president for something - bill clinton : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- no - well first - no - david frost : - he does n't know ?
bill clinton : first of all i think the , i think after the cold war was over , we had a very efficient cold war intelligence service .
as we all know the united states and the soviet union and our allies were all penetrated by our various spies .
david frost : mm .
bill clinton : and in a bizarre way , even though it seemed to be a life or death thing , the ... was probably to help avoid another nuclear war , because we knew a lot about each other 's doctrines and intents .
and then the cold war is over , and you have this massive , highly expensive intelligence apparatus , all geared to do a certain thing , full of people who speak certain languages and who know certain things and understand certain threats , and you have to turn it around to meet a whole different set of threats in the world , and speak a lot of different kinds of languages .
look , you know , there 's a lot of difference .
you and i , for example , could walk up and down the streets in warsaw in 1979 and if we were in the right kind of suits nobody would know that you were english and i was american , and if we spoke good polish we might be able to do all right .
but i 'm not so sure we 'd last very long in afghanistan , no matter what kind of outfit we had on .
and , you see , it 's a whole different deal .
we were organised to do x and we 've got to reorganise to do y and we 're not there yet .
now , let me say one other thing .
you know , from , when i was there , i thought the cia did a lot of good work and gave me a lot of good information , and they were , i felt that george tenet was always honest with me when they did n't know .
let me just say one other thing - now this does n't apply to england , to the uk , it applies to america .
there is no evidence that the cia in america told the president or the white house that saddam hussein had gotten uranium yellow cake from niger , or was close to having a nuclear weapon , a representation that was made .
now the intelligence in the uk may have told prime minister blair but the evidence is to the contrary in america .
and there is no evidence that the cia ever said that saddam hussein was tied to al-qaeda and could have had anything to do with september 11th directly or indirectly , a representation that 's been made by our government in america .
so i think it 's important to look to the future , to try to figure out how we can organise the intelligence services properly , how we can have the proper relationship between the policymakers and intelligence .
but it 's important not to blame them for things that they either did n't do or that were perfectly predictable while they were trying to adjust to a new security environment .
david frost : the intelligence community got it wrong , in america , and seems to have got it wrong here , and the president and the prime minister both received that information and went ahead with it , who is , who is to blame ?
i mean john kerry says bush decisions cost lives but who is to blame when faulty intelligence comes in ?
the person who delivers it or the person who receives and accepts it ?
bill clinton : ...
i think certainly if the person who delivers it gives false intelligence that he should have known was false or by a reasonable effort could have known was false , he is to blame .
if the person who receives it and acts on it fails to ask questions which a reasonable person would ask , which would have shown up the holes in the intelligence , then he has to share the responsibility .
but it depends on how that intelligence came to them and whether it came from a source that had been reliable in the past .
you know just not very long ago vice-president cheney was still representing that , that saddam hussein had something to do with 9/11 and was somehow tied to the al-qaeda , so that 's not george tenet 's fault , that 's not the cia 's fault , so it 's important to unpack this .
the larger problem is nobody ever wants to admit they 're not very good at something .
you do n't and i do n't .
nobody does .
david frost : as we come towards the end of this interview , one question .
what would you put on your gravestone if you were the man writing it ?
what would you like to see there ?
bill clinton : -lrb- long pause -rrb- he loved his family , his friends and his country .
he left them and the world better than he found them .
david frost : and in making that world better , do you plan to take on in the future here any major , major assignments of your own , apart from becoming first husband ?
bill clinton : well i , i 'm very proud of hillary and i 'm glad to support her political career , i have no political designs of my own .
when i finish the book tour , i 'm going to do what i can for senator kerry , whom i strongly support and believe would be an excellent president .
david frost : you do n't think you 'll overshadow him ?
bill clinton : no .
no .
he 's the main event now , starting in late july , he 'll be our nominee .
but i 'll do whatever he wants , if he wants me to stay home and play golf , i 'll do that too .
but what i 'm , but anyway , in any case when this , when my book tour is over and when the election is over , i intend to be a full time public servant again , so i 'm going to go back - i 'm a long way from finishing this aids project .
you know we , i 'm going to work through that , i have education projects and religious and racial reconciliation projects in the middle east and africa and india , economic projects .
so i 'm going to do a lot of the work that i did as president where i can still have an impact , through my foundation .
and the longer and harder i work , the more things i will try to add to that and the more - but i believe that i should just be a private citizen doing what i can .
i think jimmy carter 's been a great former president and i think that there 's a lot of evidence that what he 's done for 20 years and what i 've done for three that can make a difference - that 's what i intend to do .
david frost : and to use a phrase from report cards and so on , if you were asked the question how many marks out of ten would you give yourself as a president ?
bill clinton : i would n't answer .
david frost : -lrb- laughs -rrb- bill clinton : i would n't answer because it 's better for me to let history judge and i think that it will be judged over and over .
but i will say this , the way i kept score was by considering everyone 's life a story , just like mine was .
and i wanted more people to have better stories when i stopped than when i started .
i do n't think there 's any question that a lot of them did .
i kept score by the over 22 million new jobs , more than ten million more people with college aid , five million more kids with health insurance , 43 million more young people breathing clean air .
i could go on .
35 million with a family leave law .
we had safer streets , we a cleaner environment , and around the world the people in bosnia and kosovo had better stories , the people in northern ireland had better stories , the people in the middle east made seven years of progress towards peace and in ' 98 we had the only year in the history of the state of israel where no-one died in a terrorist attack .
so you know we reconciled with russia , with china , we built these international organisations .
i think a lot of people had better stories .
and that the only way i know .
i would n't give myself stars or historical rankings .
all i know is the way i kept score is that i wanted more people to have better stories , and a lot of them did nb : this transcript was typed from a recording and not copied from an original script .

former u.s. president , william jefferson clinton david frost : mr president , one of the most absorbing parts of " my life " is the story of negotiations which eventually failed with arafat and so on , on the middle east , and you write : " right before i left office , arafat thanked me for all my efforts and told me what a great man i was .
mr chairman , i replied , i am not a great man , i am a failure and you have made me a failure . "
bill clinton : yeah , i did n't mean that i was a failure all round but i meant that i had failed to get them to make a conference of peace .
and i thought arafat was making a terrible mistake .
i did n't know for sure , then , and frankly i do n't know for sure today , why he turned down the , the plan that i outlined .
because about a year after i left office he said he wanted it .
and by then he had a prime minister who would n't give it to him in israel and a government and a public in israel that did n't trust him any more .
david frost : but do you think he , he basically could n't give up being a revolutionary ?
bill clinton : i think that he psychologically found it very difficult to transfer from being a , the leader of the world 's great cause , being the world 's great victim , to running a state , a small state at that , and trying to solve the problems that were inherent in that , to join the israelis and all the other arab states in fighting regional terror , in trying to build a whole different future , a different mindset .
i think that is a lot of it .
i know that there are a number of people on this team who wanted to do the agreement and i , i believe to this day that it gave them 97 per cent or more of what they wanted and would have been , on balance , a huge advance for the palestinian people .
david frost : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- do you think israel is responsible for using too much , too much force ?
do you think , for instance , that sharon has made the right response to the international court of justice , saying that this wall is illegal ?
bill clinton : well it 's very difficult for him ... when the overwhelming majority of israelis want it because it 's worked in gaza .
i mean if you look at where they 've had the fence in gaza , deaths from terror have gone down .
so , you know , the way the israelis hear that is because it 's going to be unfair to some palestinian property owners and it seems to prejudge a final territorial settlement , you must continue to die .
your civilians must continue to die .
that 's the way this is being heard in israel .
the court decision , it 's like saying we want you to continue to be more exposed to terror , and it 's unfortunate that more of you will have to die but that 's the way we feel .
now that 's the way it 's heard in israel .
and i say this as someone who is very much in favour of a palestinian state , who believes that the palestinians have been horribly mistreated in the past , not just by occasional israeli governments but by other arab states who have ignored their plight or used them .
the thing i regret about the wall is different .
i think that any continued building the wall ought to be coupled with the withdrawal from gaza of israel .
second , i think the israelis ought to make it clear that they are more than willing to negotiate a final settlement , including turning the west bank back to the palestinians , and that whether there would be such a wall along the final border of israel would depend upon a mutual agreement and the capacity of the israelis and the new palestinian state to contain terror .
but , you know , i think the wall built on its own will not satisfy the israelis desire for peace and security .
by just leaving the wall down , when they evidence in gaza that it works to keep civilians alive , it 's a pretty hard argument to make to the israelis .
david frost : tell me mr president , you said to bob woodward , i would have preferred to have been president during the second world war - what was your thought in saying that ?
bill clinton : well i always thought of myself as sort of a world war ii person .
you know , great causes , and things were black and white , and it was a simpler time where people knew politics mattered .
but in my book i say in the epilogue something i came to believe very strongly , that i was very well suited by background experience and by psychology , it 's the way i think and feel , to be president when i was .
i have always been able to take apparently disparate events and put them together , and i get along well with all kinds of people .
so , i said that to woodward , i think in the beginning , because i always , i love the world war ii period , and i love the idea of being involved in a great endeavour .
but i think on balance i served when i should have served because i was well suited for it .
just like theodore roosevelt complained that he did n't have the civil war like abraham lincoln , but theodore roosevelt was quite wrong , he served us well when he did , he was the first president of the industrial age and he told us we were going to have to be a world power .
so he did a great thing , even though he did n't understand it or appreciate his own presidency at the time for how important it was .
david frost : and also , as you hinted at there , it 's difficult to be remembered as a great president if you have n't had to cope with a war .
bill clinton : i think in future times , you know these things they go through incarnations , the way we 're all evaluated .
when i was president there were two new biographies of general grant , lincoln 's commander in the civil war , who was great , rated always a great commander and a horrible president .
and these two new biographies sort of wrote him up as a president .
so , i think , you know , a hundred years from now , we may come to value the peacemakers more .
we may come to value the peacemakers more even sooner .
and we may , someday , come to give people credit for the bad things they stopped from happening , as well as the messes they cleaned up after they occur .
david frost : and if you had your time over again as president , you list in the book a number of triumphs and a number of a failures , but if there was one incident that you could rewrite or handle differently , what would that one be ?
bill clinton : well , if i could i would like to mention one at home , one abroad .
i wish i had moved in rwanda quickly .
i wish i had gone in there quicker , not just waited ' til the camps were set up .
we , we might have been able to save , probably not even half those who were lost but still a large number of people .
i really regret that .
i care a lot about africa and i do n't think that these ... wars are inevitable and these kinds of murders are inevitable .
and i 've spent a good deal of time in the last ten years trying to make it up to africa in general and the rwandans in particular - so i regret that deeply .
david frost : actually in fact in terms of aids too is something else where you and africa are closely intertwined .

two years ago , at that conference , i was asked by a number of countries , in the caribbean and africa , to help bring in medical teams to set up health care delivery networks .
so i agreed to do that .
and we 're now working in 13 caribbean , four african countries and in china .
then it occurred to me that a lot of these countries , they have per capita incomes of about a dollar a day .
back then the generic aids medicine was selling for around 500 dollars a year , as opposed to 11,000 in america .
so we negotiated the price down to 140 dollars a year - we cut the price by 70 per cent - and the world health organisation is supporting us , the global fund on aids , t.b and malaria is supporting us , we now have about 20 other countries buying medicine off this contract .

david frost : well talking of events that maybe could have gone differently and so on , i hope you wo n't be disappointed when i tell you that i 'm only planning to ask a couple of questions on the subject of monica lewinsky because i feel you must be pretty talked out on it and - bill clinton : well that 's the thing that i - david frost : - our audience , our audience is probably heard out on it , as it were .

i mean when you read that the cia has been very mistaken and so on , do you blame , do you blame the intelligence service or do you blame the people who read the intelligence ?
or is it unfair to blame a president for something - bill clinton : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- no - well first - no - david frost : - he does n't know ?
bill clinton : first of all i think the , i think after the cold war was over , we had a very efficient cold war intelligence service .
as we all know the united states and the soviet union and our allies were all penetrated by our various spies .
david frost : mm .
bill clinton : and in a bizarre way , even though it seemed to be a life or death thing , the ... was probably to help avoid another nuclear war , because we knew a lot about each other 's doctrines and intents .
and then the cold war is over , and you have this massive , highly expensive intelligence apparatus , all geared to do a certain thing , full of people who speak certain languages and who know certain things and understand certain threats , and you have to turn it around to meet a whole different set of threats in the world , and speak a lot of different kinds of languages .
look , you know , there 's a lot of difference .
you and i , for example , could walk up and down the streets in warsaw in 1979 and if we were in the right kind of suits nobody would know that you were english and i was american , and if we spoke good polish we might be able to do all right .
but i 'm not so sure we 'd last very long in afghanistan , no matter what kind of outfit we had on .
and , you see , it 's a whole different deal .
we were organised to do x and we 've got to reorganise to do y and we 're not there yet .
now , let me say one other thing .
you know , from , when i was there , i thought the cia did a lot of good work and gave me a lot of good information , and they were , i felt that george tenet was always honest with me when they did n't know .
let me just say one other thing - now this does n't apply to england , to the uk , it applies to america .
there is no evidence that the cia in america told the president or the white house that saddam hussein had gotten uranium yellow cake from niger , or was close to having a nuclear weapon , a representation that was made .
now the intelligence in the uk may have told prime minister blair but the evidence is to the contrary in america .
and there is no evidence that the cia ever said that saddam hussein was tied to al-qaeda and could have had anything to do with september 11th directly or indirectly , a representation that 's been made by our government in america .
so i think it 's important to look to the future , to try to figure out how we can organise the intelligence services properly , how we can have the proper relationship between the policymakers and intelligence .
but it 's important not to blame them for things that they either did n't do or that were perfectly predictable while they were trying to adjust to a new security environment .
david frost : the intelligence community got it wrong , in america , and seems to have got it wrong here , and the president and the prime minister both received that information and went ahead with it , who is , who is to blame ?
i mean john kerry says bush decisions cost lives but who is to blame when faulty intelligence comes in ?
the person who delivers it or the person who receives and accepts it ?
bill clinton : ...
i think certainly if the person who delivers it gives false intelligence that he should have known was false or by a reasonable effort could have known was false , he is to blame .
if the person who receives it and acts on it fails to ask questions which a reasonable person would ask , which would have shown up the holes in the intelligence , then he has to share the responsibility .
but it depends on how that intelligence came to them and whether it came from a source that had been reliable in the past .
you know just not very long ago vice-president cheney was still representing that , that saddam hussein had something to do with 9/11 and was somehow tied to the al-qaeda , so that 's not george tenet 's fault , that 's not the cia 's fault , so it 's important to unpack this .
the larger problem is nobody ever wants to admit they 're not very good at something .
you do n't and i do n't .
nobody does .
david frost : as we come towards the end of this interview , one question .
what would you put on your gravestone if you were the man writing it ?
what would you like to see there ?
bill clinton : -lrb- long pause -rrb- he loved his family , his friends and his country .
he left them and the world better than he found them .
david frost : and in making that world better , do you plan to take on in the future here any major , major assignments of your own , apart from becoming first husband ?
bill clinton : well i , i 'm very proud of hillary and i 'm glad to support her political career , i have no political designs of my own .
when i finish the book tour , i 'm going to do what i can for senator kerry , whom i strongly support and believe would be an excellent president .
david frost : you do n't think you 'll overshadow him ?
bill clinton : no .
no .
he 's the main event now , starting in late july , he 'll be our nominee .
but i 'll do whatever he wants , if he wants me to stay home and play golf , i 'll do that too .
but what i 'm , but anyway , in any case when this , when my book tour is over and when the election is over , i intend to be a full time public servant again , so i 'm going to go back - i 'm a long way from finishing this aids project .
you know we , i 'm going to work through that , i have education projects and religious and racial reconciliation projects in the middle east and africa and india , economic projects .
so i 'm going to do a lot of the work that i did as president where i can still have an impact , through my foundation .
and the longer and harder i work , the more things i will try to add to that and the more - but i believe that i should just be a private citizen doing what i can .
i think jimmy carter 's been a great former president and i think that there 's a lot of evidence that what he 's done for 20 years and what i 've done for three that can make a difference - that 's what i intend to do .
david frost : and to use a phrase from report cards and so on , if you were asked the question how many marks out of ten would you give yourself as a president ?
bill clinton : i would n't answer .
david frost : -lrb- laughs -rrb- bill clinton : i would n't answer because it 's better for me to let history judge and i think that it will be judged over and over .
but i will say this , the way i kept score was by considering everyone 's life a story , just like mine was .
and i wanted more people to have better stories when i stopped than when i started .
i do n't think there 's any question that a lot of them did .
i kept score by the over 22 million new jobs , more than ten million more people with college aid , five million more kids with health insurance , 43 million more young people breathing clean air .
i could go on .
35 million with a family leave law .
we had safer streets , we a cleaner environment , and around the world the people in bosnia and kosovo had better stories , the people in northern ireland had better stories , the people in the middle east made seven years of progress towards peace and in ' 98 we had the only year in the history of the state of israel where no-one died in a terrorist attack .
so you know we reconciled with russia , with china , we built these international organisations .
i think a lot of people had better stories .
and that the only way i know .
i would n't give myself stars or historical rankings .
all i know is the way i kept score is that i wanted more people to have better stories , and a lot of them did nb : this transcript was typed from a recording and not copied from an original script .

former u.s. president , william jefferson clinton david frost : mr president , one of the most absorbing parts of " my life " is the story of negotiations which eventually failed with arafat and so on , on the middle east , and you write : " right before i left office , arafat thanked me for all my efforts and told me what a great man i was .
mr chairman , i replied , i am not a great man , i am a failure and you have made me a failure . "
bill clinton : yeah , i did n't mean that i was a failure all round but i meant that i had failed to get them to make a conference of peace .
and i thought arafat was making a terrible mistake .
i did n't know for sure , then , and frankly i do n't know for sure today , why he turned down the , the plan that i outlined .
because about a year after i left office he said he wanted it .
and by then he had a prime minister who would n't give it to him in israel and a government and a public in israel that did n't trust him any more .
david frost : but do you think he , he basically could n't give up being a revolutionary ?
bill clinton : i think that he psychologically found it very difficult to transfer from being a , the leader of the world 's great cause , being the world 's great victim , to running a state , a small state at that , and trying to solve the problems that were inherent in that , to join the israelis and all the other arab states in fighting regional terror , in trying to build a whole different future , a different mindset .
i think that is a lot of it .
i know that there are a number of people on this team who wanted to do the agreement and i , i believe to this day that it gave them 97 per cent or more of what they wanted and would have been , on balance , a huge advance for the palestinian people .
david frost : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- do you think israel is responsible for using too much , too much force ?
do you think , for instance , that sharon has made the right response to the international court of justice , saying that this wall is illegal ?
bill clinton : well it 's very difficult for him ... when the overwhelming majority of israelis want it because it 's worked in gaza .
i mean if you look at where they 've had the fence in gaza , deaths from terror have gone down .
so , you know , the way the israelis hear that is because it 's going to be unfair to some palestinian property owners and it seems to prejudge a final territorial settlement , you must continue to die .
your civilians must continue to die .
that 's the way this is being heard in israel .
the court decision , it 's like saying we want you to continue to be more exposed to terror , and it 's unfortunate that more of you will have to die but that 's the way we feel .
now that 's the way it 's heard in israel .
and i say this as someone who is very much in favour of a palestinian state , who believes that the palestinians have been horribly mistreated in the past , not just by occasional israeli governments but by other arab states who have ignored their plight or used them .
the thing i regret about the wall is different .
i think that any continued building the wall ought to be coupled with the withdrawal from gaza of israel .
second , i think the israelis ought to make it clear that they are more than willing to negotiate a final settlement , including turning the west bank back to the palestinians , and that whether there would be such a wall along the final border of israel would depend upon a mutual agreement and the capacity of the israelis and the new palestinian state to contain terror .
but , you know , i think the wall built on its own will not satisfy the israelis desire for peace and security .
by just leaving the wall down , when they evidence in gaza that it works to keep civilians alive , it 's a pretty hard argument to make to the israelis .
david frost : tell me mr president , you said to bob woodward , i would have preferred to have been president during the second world war - what was your thought in saying that ?
bill clinton : well i always thought of myself as sort of a world war ii person .
you know , great causes , and things were black and white , and it was a simpler time where people knew politics mattered .
but in my book i say in the epilogue something i came to believe very strongly , that i was very well suited by background experience and by psychology , it 's the way i think and feel , to be president when i was .
i have always been able to take apparently disparate events and put them together , and i get along well with all kinds of people .
so , i said that to woodward , i think in the beginning , because i always , i love the world war ii period , and i love the idea of being involved in a great endeavour .
but i think on balance i served when i should have served because i was well suited for it .
just like theodore roosevelt complained that he did n't have the civil war like abraham lincoln , but theodore roosevelt was quite wrong , he served us well when he did , he was the first president of the industrial age and he told us we were going to have to be a world power .
so he did a great thing , even though he did n't understand it or appreciate his own presidency at the time for how important it was .
david frost : and also , as you hinted at there , it 's difficult to be remembered as a great president if you have n't had to cope with a war .
bill clinton : i think in future times , you know these things they go through incarnations , the way we 're all evaluated .
when i was president there were two new biographies of general grant , lincoln 's commander in the civil war , who was great , rated always a great commander and a horrible president .
and these two new biographies sort of wrote him up as a president .
so , i think , you know , a hundred years from now , we may come to value the peacemakers more .
we may come to value the peacemakers more even sooner .
and we may , someday , come to give people credit for the bad things they stopped from happening , as well as the messes they cleaned up after they occur .
david frost : and if you had your time over again as president , you list in the book a number of triumphs and a number of a failures , but if there was one incident that you could rewrite or handle differently , what would that one be ?
bill clinton : well , if i could i would like to mention one at home , one abroad .
i wish i had moved in rwanda quickly .
i wish i had gone in there quicker , not just waited ' til the camps were set up .
we , we might have been able to save , probably not even half those who were lost but still a large number of people .
i really regret that .
i care a lot about africa and i do n't think that these ... wars are inevitable and these kinds of murders are inevitable .
and i 've spent a good deal of time in the last ten years trying to make it up to africa in general and the rwandans in particular - so i regret that deeply .
david frost : actually in fact in terms of aids too is something else where you and africa are closely intertwined .
bill clinton : yes - well david frost : and the fact , the fact that drug companies have reduced their prices , and so on , seems a bit of a miracle .
bill clinton : yeah it 's a great thing , you know , we 're now having , as we do this interview , they 're having the international aids conference in thailand .
two years ago , at that conference , i was asked by a number of countries , in the caribbean and africa , to help bring in medical teams to set up health care delivery networks .
so i agreed to do that .
and we 're now working in 13 caribbean , four african countries and in china .
then it occurred to me that a lot of these countries , they have per capita incomes of about a dollar a day .
back then the generic aids medicine was selling for around 500 dollars a year , as opposed to 11,000 in america .
so we negotiated the price down to 140 dollars a year - we cut the price by 70 per cent - and the world health organisation is supporting us , the global fund on aids , t.b and malaria is supporting us , we now have about 20 other countries buying medicine off this contract .
we could , if we could get it out there in a hurry , we could save a couple of million lives over the next few years .
it 's a huge , huge deal , and i 'm gratified that one of the countries i 'm trying to help is rwanda .
david frost : it comes full circle , yes .
in fact we did n't get your incident you would rewrite at home ...
bill clinton : the biggest change i think i would make is in my first two years .
i think we lost the congress in 1994 because i made more change and took on more tough decisions in a shorter amount of time than could be digested by the electorate .
and so i 'd made all these interest groups mad and the economy had n't had time to get better so the public , the american people gave the congress to the republicans .
and that , i think , was not good for america .
i got a lot done with the republican congress and we often worked closely together but i think i , if i had not lost the congress , we might have been able to get health care reform and we might have been able to get social security reform so that when the baby-boomers retire they wo n't be worried about imposing a big burden on their children , who should in turn be supporting their grandchildren instead of their parents .
david frost : well talking of events that maybe could have gone differently and so on , i hope you wo n't be disappointed when i tell you that i 'm only planning to ask a couple of questions on the subject of monica lewinsky because i feel you must be pretty talked out on it and - bill clinton : well that 's the thing that i - david frost : - our audience , our audience is probably heard out on it , as it were .
bill clinton : yeah .
david frost : so i just wanted ... you know one thing that 's come up since your book came out .
monica lewinsky was quoted for almost the first time saying that you 'd destroyed her life , that she had spent the last several years trying so hard to move on ... and she 'd be a wife and a mother - do you think you destroyed her life ?
bill clinton : no .
i think it 's terrible what happened to her but no i do n't .
i think it 's terrible the publicity she got , it 's terrible what kenneth starr did to her , it 's terrible that kenneth starr interrogated her mother but those , those things that were done to her were not done by me .
and i take responsibility for the mistakes i made but others have to take responsibility for mistakes they made .
and i think , you know , what , what i hope for her is that she will be able to escape this .
i mean it 's crazy , it 's like as andy warhol would say , " we all get our 15 minutes of fame " , but we have to decide whether that will define our lives or not .
and she has to make a different decision , she 's a smart good person and she can have a good life .
and , and , you know , she 's suffered a lot because she talked a lot about what happened to linda trip , and linda trip betrayed and kenneth starr abused her and the press played it up .
and , you know , then they all use it against me .
but they have to take responsibility for that , all them .
david frost : did you love her ?
bill clinton : no .
i do n't think that 's what that was about - on either side .
but i liked her very much .
i liked her very much .
i thought she was really a good-hearted , intelligent person and i wanted her to have a good life and i think that 's the one reason i continued to see her long after our , the improperness of the relationship was over .
david frost : tell me about the senate intelligence committee and the findings that the cia , in particular , was so wrong on the iraq war .
it said it went back longer than , longer than just the bush administration , that there had been these intelligence failings earlier , i wonder have you been thinking were there things on which i was ill-served by intelligence - as you look back - anything perhaps that you got blamed for maybe but that , or that you did n't get the intelligence perhaps you should have done ?
bill clinton : well i 'm - let me just mention two things .
first of all , i obviously have no way of knowing what the cia did or did n't say to president bush after i left office .
but what they said to me about iraq and weapons of mass destruction was far more limited than the case that was made to the american people .
i read those intelligence reports faithfully every day , i read a lot of other back-up intelligence , i had exhaustive conversations with george tenet on a regular basis .
what i was told was that there were unaccounted for stocks of chemical and biological weapons - that is , after the first gulf war in ' 91 was over , ... certified a volume of potential chemical and biological weapons , a few missiles , a few warheads , some nuclear laboratory capacity , nowhere near a bomb .
then , from that time forward , with the inspections process , every time we found something and destroyed , or took it away , we subtracted that from the original list .
far more weapons of mass destruction were destroyed in the inspection process than in the first gulf war .
now in 1998 , saddam hussein , trying to force the sanctions to be lifted , kicked the un inspectors out .
prime minister blair and i then ordered four days of bombing attacks - you may remember .
we did it on all the suspected sites .
then we did n't get back in .
so all i knew , and what the in , what the reports were , we could have destroyed everything there , we could have destroyed half , we could have destroyed nothing - we had no way of knowing .
we just knew there was unreported , there were still unaccounted for - that 's the proper word - unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical agents , a few missiles , a couple , a few warheads , and that could be weaponised with chemical or biological agents , and some laboratory capacity .
that 's all i knew .
so i do n't know that i should blame them about that .
the place that i was most frustrated was that after we had this first attack in 1998 on osama bin laden 's training camps - do you remember and we - david frost : yeah .
bill clinton : - uh sent the missiles in there , we were attempting to kill him and his top aides , there were three other occasions in which we were ready to strike .
and i was also prepared to order special forces in there if we had intelligence which would justify the risks .
and the pentagon strongly felt we never had enough intelligence to justify sending in the special forces .
and the three other times we were going to attack , in the end the attacks were called off because the cia said the intelligence was n't good enough .
david frost : what about the findings that you read about now ?
i mean when you read that the cia has been very mistaken and so on , do you blame , do you blame the intelligence service or do you blame the people who read the intelligence ?
or is it unfair to blame a president for something - bill clinton : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- no - well first - no - david frost : - he does n't know ?

former u.s. president , william jefferson clinton david frost : mr president , one of the most absorbing parts of " my life " is the story of negotiations which eventually failed with arafat and so on , on the middle east , and you write : " right before i left office , arafat thanked me for all my efforts and told me what a great man i was .
mr chairman , i replied , i am not a great man , i am a failure and you have made me a failure . "
bill clinton : yeah , i did n't mean that i was a failure all round but i meant that i had failed to get them to make a conference of peace .
and i thought arafat was making a terrible mistake .
i did n't know for sure , then , and frankly i do n't know for sure today , why he turned down the , the plan that i outlined .
because about a year after i left office he said he wanted it .
and by then he had a prime minister who would n't give it to him in israel and a government and a public in israel that did n't trust him any more .
david frost : but do you think he , he basically could n't give up being a revolutionary ?
bill clinton : i think that he psychologically found it very difficult to transfer from being a , the leader of the world 's great cause , being the world 's great victim , to running a state , a small state at that , and trying to solve the problems that were inherent in that , to join the israelis and all the other arab states in fighting regional terror , in trying to build a whole different future , a different mindset .
i think that is a lot of it .
i know that there are a number of people on this team who wanted to do the agreement and i , i believe to this day that it gave them 97 per cent or more of what they wanted and would have been , on balance , a huge advance for the palestinian people .
david frost : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- do you think israel is responsible for using too much , too much force ?
do you think , for instance , that sharon has made the right response to the international court of justice , saying that this wall is illegal ?
bill clinton : well it 's very difficult for him ... when the overwhelming majority of israelis want it because it 's worked in gaza .
i mean if you look at where they 've had the fence in gaza , deaths from terror have gone down .
so , you know , the way the israelis hear that is because it 's going to be unfair to some palestinian property owners and it seems to prejudge a final territorial settlement , you must continue to die .
your civilians must continue to die .
that 's the way this is being heard in israel .
the court decision , it 's like saying we want you to continue to be more exposed to terror , and it 's unfortunate that more of you will have to die but that 's the way we feel .
now that 's the way it 's heard in israel .
and i say this as someone who is very much in favour of a palestinian state , who believes that the palestinians have been horribly mistreated in the past , not just by occasional israeli governments but by other arab states who have ignored their plight or used them .
the thing i regret about the wall is different .
i think that any continued building the wall ought to be coupled with the withdrawal from gaza of israel .
second , i think the israelis ought to make it clear that they are more than willing to negotiate a final settlement , including turning the west bank back to the palestinians , and that whether there would be such a wall along the final border of israel would depend upon a mutual agreement and the capacity of the israelis and the new palestinian state to contain terror .
but , you know , i think the wall built on its own will not satisfy the israelis desire for peace and security .
by just leaving the wall down , when they evidence in gaza that it works to keep civilians alive , it 's a pretty hard argument to make to the israelis .
david frost : tell me mr president , you said to bob woodward , i would have preferred to have been president during the second world war - what was your thought in saying that ?
bill clinton : well i always thought of myself as sort of a world war ii person .
you know , great causes , and things were black and white , and it was a simpler time where people knew politics mattered .
but in my book i say in the epilogue something i came to believe very strongly , that i was very well suited by background experience and by psychology , it 's the way i think and feel , to be president when i was .
i have always been able to take apparently disparate events and put them together , and i get along well with all kinds of people .
so , i said that to woodward , i think in the beginning , because i always , i love the world war ii period , and i love the idea of being involved in a great endeavour .
but i think on balance i served when i should have served because i was well suited for it .
just like theodore roosevelt complained that he did n't have the civil war like abraham lincoln , but theodore roosevelt was quite wrong , he served us well when he did , he was the first president of the industrial age and he told us we were going to have to be a world power .
so he did a great thing , even though he did n't understand it or appreciate his own presidency at the time for how important it was .
david frost : and also , as you hinted at there , it 's difficult to be remembered as a great president if you have n't had to cope with a war .
bill clinton : i think in future times , you know these things they go through incarnations , the way we 're all evaluated .
when i was president there were two new biographies of general grant , lincoln 's commander in the civil war , who was great , rated always a great commander and a horrible president .
and these two new biographies sort of wrote him up as a president .
so , i think , you know , a hundred years from now , we may come to value the peacemakers more .
we may come to value the peacemakers more even sooner .
and we may , someday , come to give people credit for the bad things they stopped from happening , as well as the messes they cleaned up after they occur .
david frost : and if you had your time over again as president , you list in the book a number of triumphs and a number of a failures , but if there was one incident that you could rewrite or handle differently , what would that one be ?
bill clinton : well , if i could i would like to mention one at home , one abroad .
i wish i had moved in rwanda quickly .
i wish i had gone in there quicker , not just waited ' til the camps were set up .
we , we might have been able to save , probably not even half those who were lost but still a large number of people .
i really regret that .
i care a lot about africa and i do n't think that these ... wars are inevitable and these kinds of murders are inevitable .
and i 've spent a good deal of time in the last ten years trying to make it up to africa in general and the rwandans in particular - so i regret that deeply .
david frost : actually in fact in terms of aids too is something else where you and africa are closely intertwined .
bill clinton : yes - well david frost : and the fact , the fact that drug companies have reduced their prices , and so on , seems a bit of a miracle .
bill clinton : yeah it 's a great thing , you know , we 're now having , as we do this interview , they 're having the international aids conference in thailand .
two years ago , at that conference , i was asked by a number of countries , in the caribbean and africa , to help bring in medical teams to set up health care delivery networks .
so i agreed to do that .
and we 're now working in 13 caribbean , four african countries and in china .
then it occurred to me that a lot of these countries , they have per capita incomes of about a dollar a day .
back then the generic aids medicine was selling for around 500 dollars a year , as opposed to 11,000 in america .
so we negotiated the price down to 140 dollars a year - we cut the price by 70 per cent - and the world health organisation is supporting us , the global fund on aids , t.b and malaria is supporting us , we now have about 20 other countries buying medicine off this contract .
we could , if we could get it out there in a hurry , we could save a couple of million lives over the next few years .
it 's a huge , huge deal , and i 'm gratified that one of the countries i 'm trying to help is rwanda .
david frost : it comes full circle , yes .
in fact we did n't get your incident you would rewrite at home ...
bill clinton : the biggest change i think i would make is in my first two years .
i think we lost the congress in 1994 because i made more change and took on more tough decisions in a shorter amount of time than could be digested by the electorate .
and so i 'd made all these interest groups mad and the economy had n't had time to get better so the public , the american people gave the congress to the republicans .
and that , i think , was not good for america .
i got a lot done with the republican congress and we often worked closely together but i think i , if i had not lost the congress , we might have been able to get health care reform and we might have been able to get social security reform so that when the baby-boomers retire they wo n't be worried about imposing a big burden on their children , who should in turn be supporting their grandchildren instead of their parents .
david frost : well talking of events that maybe could have gone differently and so on , i hope you wo n't be disappointed when i tell you that i 'm only planning to ask a couple of questions on the subject of monica lewinsky because i feel you must be pretty talked out on it and - bill clinton : well that 's the thing that i - david frost : - our audience , our audience is probably heard out on it , as it were .
bill clinton : yeah .
david frost : so i just wanted ... you know one thing that 's come up since your book came out .
monica lewinsky was quoted for almost the first time saying that you 'd destroyed her life , that she had spent the last several years trying so hard to move on ... and she 'd be a wife and a mother - do you think you destroyed her life ?
bill clinton : no .
i think it 's terrible what happened to her but no i do n't .
i think it 's terrible the publicity she got , it 's terrible what kenneth starr did to her , it 's terrible that kenneth starr interrogated her mother but those , those things that were done to her were not done by me .
and i take responsibility for the mistakes i made but others have to take responsibility for mistakes they made .
and i think , you know , what , what i hope for her is that she will be able to escape this .
i mean it 's crazy , it 's like as andy warhol would say , " we all get our 15 minutes of fame " , but we have to decide whether that will define our lives or not .
and she has to make a different decision , she 's a smart good person and she can have a good life .
and , and , you know , she 's suffered a lot because she talked a lot about what happened to linda trip , and linda trip betrayed and kenneth starr abused her and the press played it up .
and , you know , then they all use it against me .
but they have to take responsibility for that , all them .
david frost : did you love her ?
bill clinton : no .
i do n't think that 's what that was about - on either side .
but i liked her very much .
i liked her very much .
i thought she was really a good-hearted , intelligent person and i wanted her to have a good life and i think that 's the one reason i continued to see her long after our , the improperness of the relationship was over .
david frost : tell me about the senate intelligence committee and the findings that the cia , in particular , was so wrong on the iraq war .
it said it went back longer than , longer than just the bush administration , that there had been these intelligence failings earlier , i wonder have you been thinking were there things on which i was ill-served by intelligence - as you look back - anything perhaps that you got blamed for maybe but that , or that you did n't get the intelligence perhaps you should have done ?
bill clinton : well i 'm - let me just mention two things .
first of all , i obviously have no way of knowing what the cia did or did n't say to president bush after i left office .
but what they said to me about iraq and weapons of mass destruction was far more limited than the case that was made to the american people .
i read those intelligence reports faithfully every day , i read a lot of other back-up intelligence , i had exhaustive conversations with george tenet on a regular basis .
what i was told was that there were unaccounted for stocks of chemical and biological weapons - that is , after the first gulf war in ' 91 was over , ... certified a volume of potential chemical and biological weapons , a few missiles , a few warheads , some nuclear laboratory capacity , nowhere near a bomb .
then , from that time forward , with the inspections process , every time we found something and destroyed , or took it away , we subtracted that from the original list .
far more weapons of mass destruction were destroyed in the inspection process than in the first gulf war .
now in 1998 , saddam hussein , trying to force the sanctions to be lifted , kicked the un inspectors out .
prime minister blair and i then ordered four days of bombing attacks - you may remember .
we did it on all the suspected sites .
then we did n't get back in .
so all i knew , and what the in , what the reports were , we could have destroyed everything there , we could have destroyed half , we could have destroyed nothing - we had no way of knowing .
we just knew there was unreported , there were still unaccounted for - that 's the proper word - unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical agents , a few missiles , a couple , a few warheads , and that could be weaponised with chemical or biological agents , and some laboratory capacity .
that 's all i knew .
so i do n't know that i should blame them about that .
the place that i was most frustrated was that after we had this first attack in 1998 on osama bin laden 's training camps - do you remember and we - david frost : yeah .
bill clinton : - uh sent the missiles in there , we were attempting to kill him and his top aides , there were three other occasions in which we were ready to strike .
and i was also prepared to order special forces in there if we had intelligence which would justify the risks .
and the pentagon strongly felt we never had enough intelligence to justify sending in the special forces .
and the three other times we were going to attack , in the end the attacks were called off because the cia said the intelligence was n't good enough .
david frost : what about the findings that you read about now ?
i mean when you read that the cia has been very mistaken and so on , do you blame , do you blame the intelligence service or do you blame the people who read the intelligence ?
or is it unfair to blame a president for something - bill clinton : -lrb- overlaps -rrb- no - well first - no - david frost : - he does n't know ?
bill clinton : first of all i think the , i think after the cold war was over , we had a very efficient cold war intelligence service .
as we all know the united states and the soviet union and our allies were all penetrated by our various spies .
david frost : mm .
bill clinton : and in a bizarre way , even though it seemed to be a life or death thing , the ... was probably to help avoid another nuclear war , because we knew a lot about each other 's doctrines and intents .
and then the cold war is over , and you have this massive , highly expensive intelligence apparatus , all geared to do a certain thing , full of people who speak certain languages and who know certain things and understand certain threats , and you have to turn it around to meet a whole different set of threats in the world , and speak a lot of different kinds of languages .
look , you know , there 's a lot of difference .
you and i , for example , could walk up and down the streets in warsaw in 1979 and if we were in the right kind of suits nobody would know that you were english and i was american , and if we spoke good polish we might be able to do all right .
but i 'm not so sure we 'd last very long in afghanistan , no matter what kind of outfit we had on .
and , you see , it 's a whole different deal .
we were organised to do x and we 've got to reorganise to do y and we 're not there yet .
now , let me say one other thing .
you know , from , when i was there , i thought the cia did a lot of good work and gave me a lot of good information , and they were , i felt that george tenet was always honest with me when they did n't know .
let me just say one other thing - now this does n't apply to england , to the uk , it applies to america .
there is no evidence that the cia in america told the president or the white house that saddam hussein had gotten uranium yellow cake from niger , or was close to having a nuclear weapon , a representation that was made .
now the intelligence in the uk may have told prime minister blair but the evidence is to the contrary in america .
and there is no evidence that the cia ever said that saddam hussein was tied to al-qaeda and could have had anything to do with september 11th directly or indirectly , a representation that 's been made by our government in america .
so i think it 's important to look to the future , to try to figure out how we can organise the intelligence services properly , how we can have the proper relationship between the policymakers and intelligence .
but it 's important not to blame them for things that they either did n't do or that were perfectly predictable while they were trying to adjust to a new security environment .
david frost : the intelligence community got it wrong , in america , and seems to have got it wrong here , and the president and the prime minister both received that information and went ahead with it , who is , who is to blame ?
i mean john kerry says bush decisions cost lives but who is to blame when faulty intelligence comes in ?
the person who delivers it or the person who receives and accepts it ?
bill clinton : ...
i think certainly if the person who delivers it gives false intelligence that he should have known was false or by a reasonable effort could have known was false , he is to blame .
if the person who receives it and acts on it fails to ask questions which a reasonable person would ask , which would have shown up the holes in the intelligence , then he has to share the responsibility .
but it depends on how that intelligence came to them and whether it came from a source that had been reliable in the past .
you know just not very long ago vice-president cheney was still representing that , that saddam hussein had something to do with 9/11 and was somehow tied to the al-qaeda , so that 's not george tenet 's fault , that 's not the cia 's fault , so it 's important to unpack this .
the larger problem is nobody ever wants to admit they 're not very good at something .
you do n't and i do n't .
nobody does .
david frost : as we come towards the end of this interview , one question .
what would you put on your gravestone if you were the man writing it ?
what would you like to see there ?
bill clinton : -lrb- long pause -rrb- he loved his family , his friends and his country .
he left them and the world better than he found them .
david frost : and in making that world better , do you plan to take on in the future here any major , major assignments of your own , apart from becoming first husband ?
bill clinton : well i , i 'm very proud of hillary and i 'm glad to support her political career , i have no political designs of my own .
when i finish the book tour , i 'm going to do what i can for senator kerry , whom i strongly support and believe would be an excellent president .
david frost : you do n't think you 'll overshadow him ?
bill clinton : no .
no .
he 's the main event now , starting in late july , he 'll be our nominee .
but i 'll do whatever he wants , if he wants me to stay home and play golf , i 'll do that too .
but what i 'm , but anyway , in any case when this , when my book tour is over and when the election is over , i intend to be a full time public servant again , so i 'm going to go back - i 'm a long way from finishing this aids project .
you know we , i 'm going to work through that , i have education projects and religious and racial reconciliation projects in the middle east and africa and india , economic projects .
so i 'm going to do a lot of the work that i did as president where i can still have an impact , through my foundation .
and the longer and harder i work , the more things i will try to add to that and the more - but i believe that i should just be a private citizen doing what i can .
i think jimmy carter 's been a great former president and i think that there 's a lot of evidence that what he 's done for 20 years and what i 've done for three that can make a difference - that 's what i intend to do .
david frost : and to use a phrase from report cards and so on , if you were asked the question how many marks out of ten would you give yourself as a president ?
bill clinton : i would n't answer .
david frost : -lrb- laughs -rrb- bill clinton : i would n't answer because it 's better for me to let history judge and i think that it will be judged over and over .
but i will say this , the way i kept score was by considering everyone 's life a story , just like mine was .
and i wanted more people to have better stories when i stopped than when i started .
i do n't think there 's any question that a lot of them did .
i kept score by the over 22 million new jobs , more than ten million more people with college aid , five million more kids with health insurance , 43 million more young people breathing clean air .
i could go on .
35 million with a family leave law .
we had safer streets , we a cleaner environment , and around the world the people in bosnia and kosovo had better stories , the people in northern ireland had better stories , the people in the middle east made seven years of progress towards peace and in ' 98 we had the only year in the history of the state of israel where no-one died in a terrorist attack .
so you know we reconciled with russia , with china , we built these international organisations .
i think a lot of people had better stories .
and that the only way i know .
i would n't give myself stars or historical rankings .
all i know is the way i kept score is that i wanted more people to have better stories , and a lot of them did nb : this transcript was typed from a recording and not copied from an original script .
