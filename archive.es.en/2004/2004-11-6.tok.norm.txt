investors fear the us might have trouble attracting enough capital to cover its massive trade deficit . during trading on friday , the single european currency at one point shot up to 1.2952 dollars , smashing a previous all-time summit of 1.2929 dollars reached on feb .

the euro later fell back to 1.2942 dollars in late-afternoon trade , against 1.2874 late on thursday in new york .
dealers were fretting about the economic implications of the electoral win of us president george w. bush , analysts said . " it 's the same story we 've had since the election result was made clear , " said chris furness , currency strategist at the 4cast economic consultancy firm . " on the economic front we may well get growth , but we will get growth at the cost of higher deficits , certainly the trade deficit at least , " said furness , adding that the euro could hit 1.40 dollars within the next year . last month , washington announced a record 2004 budget deficit of $ 413 billion -lrb- € 319 billion -rrb- , while the trade deficit in august rose to $ 54 billion , the second largest ever . dealers are worried about how the us will attract the necessary capital inflows to fund the deteriorating trade balance .
the fear is that overseas investors might lose confidence in the debt-ridden us economy , placing their money elsewhere . eu leaders concerned in europe , policy makers voiced concern over the euro 's record high .
a steady rise in the euro makes eurozone exports more expensive and less competitive and threatens what is already an uncertain recovery . german chancellor gerhard schröder called the strength of the euro against the dollar " worrying , " but added that germany 's export industry was robust enough to manage . " we can manage that because we are good , " schröder told a news conference in brussels on friday .

investors fear the us might have trouble attracting enough capital to cover its massive trade deficit . during trading on friday , the single european currency at one point shot up to 1.2952 dollars , smashing a previous all-time summit of 1.2929 dollars reached on feb .
18 .
the euro later fell back to 1.2942 dollars in late-afternoon trade , against 1.2874 late on thursday in new york .
dealers were fretting about the economic implications of the electoral win of us president george w. bush , analysts said . " it 's the same story we 've had since the election result was made clear , " said chris furness , currency strategist at the 4cast economic consultancy firm . " on the economic front we may well get growth , but we will get growth at the cost of higher deficits , certainly the trade deficit at least , " said furness , adding that the euro could hit 1.40 dollars within the next year . last month , washington announced a record 2004 budget deficit of $ 413 billion -lrb- € 319 billion -rrb- , while the trade deficit in august rose to $ 54 billion , the second largest ever . dealers are worried about how the us will attract the necessary capital inflows to fund the deteriorating trade balance .
the fear is that overseas investors might lose confidence in the debt-ridden us economy , placing their money elsewhere . eu leaders concerned in europe , policy makers voiced concern over the euro 's record high .
a steady rise in the euro makes eurozone exports more expensive and less competitive and threatens what is already an uncertain recovery . german chancellor gerhard schröder called the strength of the euro against the dollar " worrying , " but added that germany 's export industry was robust enough to manage . " we can manage that because we are good , " schröder told a news conference in brussels on friday .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- french president jacques chirac and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel said they were concerned euro zone exporters could be hit by the dollar 's decline . " i am a bit concerned by the downward tendency of the dollar , " chirac said on friday .
" europe would be well advised to consider the consequences this fall could have , notably for its economic activity and in particular for its exports , and possibly draw the consequences . " g7 to discuss rise in euro german economics minister wolfgang clement promised that g7 finance ministers would discuss the euro rise should it continue . " the situation is being closely watched , in particular by the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " clement said .
" but there 's no reason for concern in developments . " g7 central banks are due to meet for a regular bank of international settlements meeting in basel on monday .

investors fear the us might have trouble attracting enough capital to cover its massive trade deficit . during trading on friday , the single european currency at one point shot up to 1.2952 dollars , smashing a previous all-time summit of 1.2929 dollars reached on feb .
18 .
the euro later fell back to 1.2942 dollars in late-afternoon trade , against 1.2874 late on thursday in new york .
dealers were fretting about the economic implications of the electoral win of us president george w. bush , analysts said . " it 's the same story we 've had since the election result was made clear , " said chris furness , currency strategist at the 4cast economic consultancy firm . " on the economic front we may well get growth , but we will get growth at the cost of higher deficits , certainly the trade deficit at least , " said furness , adding that the euro could hit 1.40 dollars within the next year . last month , washington announced a record 2004 budget deficit of $ 413 billion -lrb- € 319 billion -rrb- , while the trade deficit in august rose to $ 54 billion , the second largest ever . dealers are worried about how the us will attract the necessary capital inflows to fund the deteriorating trade balance .
the fear is that overseas investors might lose confidence in the debt-ridden us economy , placing their money elsewhere . eu leaders concerned in europe , policy makers voiced concern over the euro 's record high .
a steady rise in the euro makes eurozone exports more expensive and less competitive and threatens what is already an uncertain recovery . german chancellor gerhard schröder called the strength of the euro against the dollar " worrying , " but added that germany 's export industry was robust enough to manage . " we can manage that because we are good , " schröder told a news conference in brussels on friday .

" g7 to discuss rise in euro german economics minister wolfgang clement promised that g7 finance ministers would discuss the euro rise should it continue . " the situation is being closely watched , in particular by the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " clement said .

" the elections mostly met osce 's commitments for democratic elections , agreed to by the 55 osce participating states , " the osce said in a statement two days after the us election , which gave president george w. bush a second four-year term .

" the elections mostly met osce 's commitments for democratic elections , agreed to by the 55 osce participating states , " the osce said in a statement two days after the us election , which gave president george w. bush a second four-year term .
" although it was not possible for our observers to access polling stations in all states , due to lack of provision in federal or state legislation , it appears that the voting and the processing of ballots proceeded in an orderly manner , " said barbara häring , vice president of the osce parliamentary assembly .

however , the organization noted that in the key state of ohio , voters frequently faced a wait of two to three hours to cast their vote . " significant delays at the polling station are likely to deter some voters and may restrict the right to vote .
while a solution to this problem may have cost implications , it is clearly desireable that steps are taken to reduce delays in future elections , " said the osce 's preliminary report .
the newly implemented voting computers with touch screen technology were a source of much concern before the election , though they appear to have passed osce muster .

investors fear the us might have trouble attracting enough capital to cover its massive trade deficit . during trading on friday , the single european currency at one point shot up to 1.2952 dollars , smashing a previous all-time summit of 1.2929 dollars reached on feb .
18 .
the euro later fell back to 1.2942 dollars in late-afternoon trade , against 1.2874 late on thursday in new york .
dealers were fretting about the economic implications of the electoral win of us president george w. bush , analysts said . " it 's the same story we 've had since the election result was made clear , " said chris furness , currency strategist at the 4cast economic consultancy firm . " on the economic front we may well get growth , but we will get growth at the cost of higher deficits , certainly the trade deficit at least , " said furness , adding that the euro could hit 1.40 dollars within the next year . last month , washington announced a record 2004 budget deficit of $ 413 billion -lrb- € 319 billion -rrb- , while the trade deficit in august rose to $ 54 billion , the second largest ever . dealers are worried about how the us will attract the necessary capital inflows to fund the deteriorating trade balance .
the fear is that overseas investors might lose confidence in the debt-ridden us economy , placing their money elsewhere . eu leaders concerned in europe , policy makers voiced concern over the euro 's record high .
a steady rise in the euro makes eurozone exports more expensive and less competitive and threatens what is already an uncertain recovery . german chancellor gerhard schröder called the strength of the euro against the dollar " worrying , " but added that germany 's export industry was robust enough to manage . " we can manage that because we are good , " schröder told a news conference in brussels on friday .

-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- french president jacques chirac and austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel said they were concerned euro zone exporters could be hit by the dollar 's decline . " i am a bit concerned by the downward tendency of the dollar , " chirac said on friday .
" europe would be well advised to consider the consequences this fall could have , notably for its economic activity and in particular for its exports , and possibly draw the consequences . " g7 to discuss rise in euro german economics minister wolfgang clement promised that g7 finance ministers would discuss the euro rise should it continue . " the situation is being closely watched , in particular by the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " clement said .
" but there 's no reason for concern in developments . " g7 central banks are due to meet for a regular bank of international settlements meeting in basel on monday .

" the elections mostly met osce 's commitments for democratic elections , agreed to by the 55 osce participating states , " the osce said in a statement two days after the us election , which gave president george w. bush a second four-year term .
" although it was not possible for our observers to access polling stations in all states , due to lack of provision in federal or state legislation , it appears that the voting and the processing of ballots proceeded in an orderly manner , " said barbara häring , vice president of the osce parliamentary assembly .

however , the organization noted that in the key state of ohio , voters frequently faced a wait of two to three hours to cast their vote . " significant delays at the polling station are likely to deter some voters and may restrict the right to vote .
while a solution to this problem may have cost implications , it is clearly desireable that steps are taken to reduce delays in future elections , " said the osce 's preliminary report .
the newly implemented voting computers with touch screen technology were a source of much concern before the election , though they appear to have passed osce muster .
there were only " occasional " failures , the organization said .

polish observer konrad olszewski told the international herald tribune that the e-voting system in venezuela was better protected against failures and errors than the computers used in florida .

" each electronic vote in venezuela also produces a ticket that voters then drop into a ballot box , " gould told the iht .
" unlike fully electronic systems , this gives a backup that can be used to counter claims of massive fraud . "
voting reform a " work in progress " after a five-week delay in counting votes after the 2000 us election , the help america vote act -lrb- hava -rrb- was passed to correct voting errors that led to a bitter court battle .

" the elections mostly met osce 's commitments for democratic elections , agreed to by the 55 osce participating states , " the osce said in a statement two days after the us election , which gave president george w. bush a second four-year term .
" although it was not possible for our observers to access polling stations in all states , due to lack of provision in federal or state legislation , it appears that the voting and the processing of ballots proceeded in an orderly manner , " said barbara häring , vice president of the osce parliamentary assembly .

the national indigenous council will be headed by a magistrate , dr sue gordon .
she said it would focus on addressing domestic violence and reducing the widespread dependence on welfare .
earlier this year , the government abolished the biggest indigenous organisation , the aboriginal and torres strait islander commission -lrb- atsic -rrb- .
the creation of the national indigenous council is the latest attempt to give aboriginal australians a real say in how problems in their communities are addressed .
the indigenous affairs minister , amanda vanstone , said the 14 members selected by the government would be able to give top quality advice .
they include a professional sportsman , a nurse and a successful entrepreneur .
' token gesture ' the new organisation has been rejected by some aboriginal leaders who have labelled it a token gesture and its members government lackeys .
dr gordon has brushed aside the criticism .
the children 's court magistrate has told an australian newspaper that there was much work to be done and that violence within aboriginal families had become monstrous .
australia 's aborigines suffer alarming rates of ill-health , unemployment and imprisonment .
for many , poverty and disease have become a way of life , although hundreds of projects around the country are shedding light into these dark and depressing corners .
prime minister john howard announced earlier this year that atsic - set up in 1990 to provide advice on indigenous affairs - would be scrapped .
he insisted the organisation had become too preoccupied with symbolic issues rather than the serious day-to-day problems faced by aborigines .

the national indigenous council will be headed by a magistrate , dr sue gordon .
she said it would focus on addressing domestic violence and reducing the widespread dependence on welfare .
earlier this year , the government abolished the biggest indigenous organisation , the aboriginal and torres strait islander commission -lrb- atsic -rrb- .
the creation of the national indigenous council is the latest attempt to give aboriginal australians a real say in how problems in their communities are addressed .
the indigenous affairs minister , amanda vanstone , said the 14 members selected by the government would be able to give top quality advice .
they include a professional sportsman , a nurse and a successful entrepreneur .
' token gesture ' the new organisation has been rejected by some aboriginal leaders who have labelled it a token gesture and its members government lackeys .
dr gordon has brushed aside the criticism .
the children 's court magistrate has told an australian newspaper that there was much work to be done and that violence within aboriginal families had become monstrous .
australia 's aborigines suffer alarming rates of ill-health , unemployment and imprisonment .
for many , poverty and disease have become a way of life , although hundreds of projects around the country are shedding light into these dark and depressing corners .
prime minister john howard announced earlier this year that atsic - set up in 1990 to provide advice on indigenous affairs - would be scrapped .
he insisted the organisation had become too preoccupied with symbolic issues rather than the serious day-to-day problems faced by aborigines .

the mum-of-three said she planned to attempt the event even if it proved too difficult to finish .
husband mike , 43 , said people should not assume jane found the events easy - in fact they put her under strain .
he said : " jane 's dying an awfully painful death .

last week , jane was admitted to casualty after pain caused her to lose her ability to walk or dress herself .
it is hoped that by taking part in the event she will reach her goal of raising £ 1m .
in october , she was honoured at the woman of the year awards and was given an mbe by the queen in 2002 .

local authorities in county durham , tyne and wear and northumberland worked with drug action teams on the ' drug driving-you 'd be off your head ' scheme .
the aim was to raise awareness of the penalties and consequences of driving under the influence of drugs .
the award will be presented at a regional road safety conference held at county hall in durham on tuesday .
the campaign included hard-hitting radio advertisements , with genuine case studies from people whose lives had been adversely affected by drug driving , backed up by powerful images on posters and buses throughout the region .
it generated almost 3,400 online survey responses , and claimed to be the biggest self-completion survey ever undertaken in the uk .
alan kennedy , durham county council 's road safety manager and chair of the regional road safety offices said : " there has been a 60 % reduction in the number of young people saying they would risk drug driving in the future . "
the award , for improved public education , will be handed over on tuesday , and then formally presented by prince michael of kent at a ceremony in london in december .
