in fact , brits have made a point of not doing it while in the company of germans because of the sensitivity of the subject . but now , with queen elizabeth ii due in germany next month on a state visit , it is alleged that the germans are actively encouraging the monarch to disregard basil fawlty 's advice and " do mention the war . " a report in the conservative british newspaper daily express suggests that the queen , who will have talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler during her trip in the first week of november , is being put under pressure by the german government to apologize for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 . royal denials the royal family has denied any such pressure . " we have not been asked for an apology , " penny russell-smith , a royal spokesperson , told german news magazine der spiegel in response to the daily express headline : " germans want the queen to say sorry for war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii , second from right , grew up during the war .
russell-smith alluded to the queen 's own personal experience of the war and her sympathy to those affected by it . " the queen is very conscious of the suffering of all people during the war , " she said , adding that the queen had made a donation to the fund for the rebuilding of dresden 's monuments and will also take part in benefit concert to raise money for completing the city 's rebuilt frauenkirche while in germany . british press notes german memory loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demolished city of dresden is seen after the allied forces air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 .
meanwhile at home , the british paper made it very clear about how it felt about an apology . " it would be completely wrong if the queen apologized for the bombardment of german towns in the second world war or even for her to express regret , " the paper wrote in its editorial .
" lately , the germans have been keen to forget about history .
maybe they have forgotten that it was they who started the war . " germany has changed its attitude towards world war ii in recent times thanks to a leadership without any direct relationship with the war years that 's intent on moving away from the guilt complex that has dogged previous generations . john cleese line may be good advice but it may be prudent for the germans to stick to the fawlty towers line and not mention the war , especially as the queen 's husband , prince phillip , is accompanying her . the duke of edinburgh , a man who once asked a delegation of australian aborigines if they still threw spears at each other , is not renowned for his tolerance of foreigners or his tact . any attempt to extract an apology may prompt a re-enactment of a certain infamous " goose-stepping " scene from the unapologetic consort and a possible international crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brits out of -lrb- goose -rrb- step with modern german image thousands of shocked britons return from germany amazed at not seeing a single example of " goose-stepping " .

paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .

the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff .

energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .

der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .

the alternative location , penly near dieppe , was ruled out in reaction to local protests . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . -lrb- july 4 , 2004 -rrb- france plans for its energy future nuclear energy still provides france with most of its energy , but the country is looking at alternative sources for the future .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.10.2004 us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles suggest further dialogue but the us is not convinced iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations . representatives of britain , france and germany met with iranian officials in vienna on thursday to ask tehran to reassure the world that it was not secretly developing atomic weapons .
iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.10.2004 leipzig hopes to gain dhl hub großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl is looking at possible new sites in france or germany courier service dhl is expected to set up an intercontinental hub either in vatry , france , or leipzig , germany .
for the eastern german city , a lot is at stake . dhl , a unit german mail carrier deutsche post , launched a review of its operations earlier this year covering a shake-up of its complexes in brussels and bonn . the company said thursday it had scrapped plans to expand operations in brussels with the loss of up to 1,700 jobs , after belgian politicians failed to resolve a row over night flights . with brussels no longer in the running , the two most likely locations for dhl 's international hub are vatry and leipzig .
" we 'll be making our decision in the next two to three weeks , " said dhl express chief for europe peter kruse . " leipzig can provide 24-service , " he added , and pointed out that the availability of qualified employees and generous state support - based on the € 70.8 million -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- the eu recently earmarked for leipzig - made the city an attractive option . the move would create several thousand new jobs and help secure existing positions at the leipzig airport . threatened government the brussels plans stalled on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of zaventem , brussels airport .
months of negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government . " dhl regrets that despite intensive involvement of the -lrb- belgian -rrb- government and major efforts by dhl , no official nor adequate proposal has been sent to the company 's management , " said dhl in a statement . " this will prevent dhl from implementing its long-term expansion plan at brussels national airport and from creating an intercontinental hub , " it added in a statement . strike action on the cards according to media reports , dhl workers have decided to launch strike action following the company 's decision , made at an extraordinary board meeting . dhl said it will continue with its current operations until 2008 , and then maintain a regional centre in brussels . among the measures which the courier company had been seeking was a doubling of the number of night flights allowed out of the belgian capital 's airport . on tuesday belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt urged dhl to consider replacing its noisier mcdonnell-douglas 11 cargo planes with quieter version by 2011 and not 2018 as the company had suggested .

paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .
der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 22.10.2004 opinion : kyoto clears final hurdle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia produces 17 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases after seven years in limbo , russia 's parliament finally ratified the kyoto protocol , the last obstacle before the climate treaty comes into force worldwide .
it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 22.10.2004 opinion : kyoto clears final hurdle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia produces 17 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases after seven years in limbo , russia 's parliament finally ratified the kyoto protocol , the last obstacle before the climate treaty comes into force worldwide .
it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .
it will now be difficult for the united states government to continue giving the international climate protection treaty the cold shoulder - not matter who the future american president is . jens thurau -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu welcomes russian kyoto approval the european commission on thursday welcomed the approval by russia 's cabinet of the kyoto protocol thursday , claiming it was a " victory " for the european union which has pushed moscow hard on the issue .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .

the bottleneck is clearly a lack of coordination and an insufficient and bureaucratic flow of information among them . " the cdu has complained that the exchange of information among a staggering 37 anti-terrorism authorities in germany can sometimes take up to four weeks .
the conservatives now want to combine the anti-terrorism activities of germany ’ s 16 federal states with those of the central government in berlin . the new centralized agency should combine the tasks of police and intelligence services here and compile daily status reports .
fritz rudolf körper , otto schily ’ s right-hand man for counter-terrorism in the interior ministry , disagreed and said there 's no need for a new agency as two government-controlled risk assessment offices are currently being established . central office will bring coherance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the central office of the federal criminal agency in weisbaden .

" under germany ’ s post-war constitution , police duties and intelligence activities can not be combined - a principle which harks back to the blatant civil rights abuses committed during the nazi period .
max stadler , justice expert for the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , vehemently opposes the cdu ’ s plans . balance between liberty and justice " it must be possible to combat terrorism and at the same time stick to the rule of law here , " he said .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2004 germany well-prepared for flu season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't too needle-happy when it comes to influenza even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .
andrea grüber of the influenza working group minced no words this week .

if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

let us not fool ourselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2004 germany well-prepared for flu season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't too needle-happy when it comes to influenza even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .
andrea grüber of the influenza working group minced no words this week .

his stubbornness is leading to a head-on collision between european institutions - a collision whose outcome is uncertain , apart from the fact that it will do italy no good whatsoever . in belgium de morgen said if the barroso commission is approved by parliament , which is still possible in spite of all the growling , then we will have proof that europe is not preoccupied with european ideals , but with national interests .
let us not fool ourselves .
german social democrats are not going to vote down a commission in which fellow countryman and party member günter verheugen has a key position .
the british have probably received instructions to vote for blair 's close ally peter mandelson and many belgium liberals will hardly dare to mess things up for louis michel .
but for years , the belgium paper continued , the european parliament has grumbled that it is not taken seriously .
on wednesday it will a have first class opportunity to prove its worth .
if it fails to muster the courage , then meps wo n't have to bother to grumble anymore about being members of a pseudo-parliament .
the tages anzeiger in switzerland said meps may not like the last-minute minor changes to the commission barroso is proposing , but they should not the less give it their blessing .
a divided europe without leadership , the paper maintained , is in nobody 's interest .
the french paper liberation believes the vatican is fighting a dangerous rearguard action in a bid to wield influence in europe .
barroso has made a grave mistake in insisting on buttiglione as justice commissioner .
in this context , it is important to highlight the temporal character of european democracy - as a means of fending off all fundamentalists claiming superiority of moral laws over the rights of others .
it is vitally important for europe 's survival , the french paper said , that religion - whether the catholic faith or any other - remains contained within the church and a matter solely for individual conscience .
the german paper die welt believes that they can only be losers in the dispute between the european parliament and the commission .
the biggest loser the paper said will be the european parliament .
frustrated by limitations on its influence , it has started a power struggle with the commission , which is not only about buttiglione .
but it can not win .
there will be a majority for barroso and parliament will have made itself look ridiculous once again . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in fact , brits have made a point of not doing it while in the company of germans because of the sensitivity of the subject . but now , with queen elizabeth ii due in germany next month on a state visit , it is alleged that the germans are actively encouraging the monarch to disregard basil fawlty 's advice and " do mention the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.10.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc duma set to vote on kyoto the russian parliament , the duma , will hold a vote on ratification of the kyoto protocol on friday .
the largely pro-kremlin house is expected to adopt the international treaty on climate change .
interfax reported that duma speaker boris gryzlov has backed the unconditional adoption of the protocol .
the vote follows a recommendation from russian president vladimir putin that the duma approve the text moscow signed in 1997 .
with a lack of chinese and us backing for the deal , russian support is needed for the treaty to come into force .
the eu has pressed hard for russia to adopt the text , offering support for russian membership of the world trade organisation in return .
if the duma votes to back kyoto , as expected , it will then go to the upper house and onto president putin , who will have to sign it into russian law .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2004 opposition criticizes german terror record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were shocked that the 9/11 terrorists lived among them germany 's conservative opposition has accused chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government of failing to protect the population effectively from the threat of international terrorism . in the bundestag on friday , speakers of the conservative union parties warned that germany ’ s law enforcement and intelligence authorities were ill-prepared for countering terrorism and were in need of a structural overhaul .
they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .
" since the government has no successes to present , all it can do is cry out for greater powers , " he told reporters . separation weakens information flow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" interior minister otto schily wants to tighten his grip on regional authorities .
but the separation of regional and central structures in crime fighting is not the problem .
the bottleneck is clearly a lack of coordination and an insufficient and bureaucratic flow of information among them . " the cdu has complained that the exchange of information among a staggering 37 anti-terrorism authorities in germany can sometimes take up to four weeks .
the conservatives now want to combine the anti-terrorism activities of germany ’ s 16 federal states with those of the central government in berlin . the new centralized agency should combine the tasks of police and intelligence services here and compile daily status reports .
fritz rudolf körper , otto schily ’ s right-hand man for counter-terrorism in the interior ministry , disagreed and said there 's no need for a new agency as two government-controlled risk assessment offices are currently being established . central office will bring coherance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the central office of the federal criminal agency in weisbaden .
" the two offices will be concentrating our staff ‘ s individual knowledge about islamic terrorism in a central location , " he explained .
" this will enable us to speed up and intensify the flow of information , while sticking to the principle of the separation of police and intelligence services . " under germany ’ s post-war constitution , police duties and intelligence activities can not be combined - a principle which harks back to the blatant civil rights abuses committed during the nazi period .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .

" interior minister otto schily wants to tighten his grip on regional authorities .
but the separation of regional and central structures in crime fighting is not the problem .
the bottleneck is clearly a lack of coordination and an insufficient and bureaucratic flow of information among them . " the cdu has complained that the exchange of information among a staggering 37 anti-terrorism authorities in germany can sometimes take up to four weeks .
the conservatives now want to combine the anti-terrorism activities of germany ’ s 16 federal states with those of the central government in berlin . the new centralized agency should combine the tasks of police and intelligence services here and compile daily status reports .

" the two offices will be concentrating our staff ‘ s individual knowledge about islamic terrorism in a central location , " he explained .
" this will enable us to speed up and intensify the flow of information , while sticking to the principle of the separation of police and intelligence services . " under germany ’ s post-war constitution , police duties and intelligence activities can not be combined - a principle which harks back to the blatant civil rights abuses committed during the nazi period .
max stadler , justice expert for the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , vehemently opposes the cdu ’ s plans . balance between liberty and justice " it must be possible to combat terrorism and at the same time stick to the rule of law here , " he said .
" if we are going to jettison our legal principles in this fight we can just as well give up discussing the protection of privacy rights in this parliament and allow security services to gather information however they want .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .
andrea grüber of the influenza working group minced no words this week .

in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .

susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2004 germany well-prepared for flu season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't too needle-happy when it comes to influenza even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .
" since the government has no successes to present , all it can do is cry out for greater powers , " he told reporters . separation weakens information flow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" interior minister otto schily wants to tighten his grip on regional authorities .

the bottleneck is clearly a lack of coordination and an insufficient and bureaucratic flow of information among them . " the cdu has complained that the exchange of information among a staggering 37 anti-terrorism authorities in germany can sometimes take up to four weeks .
the conservatives now want to combine the anti-terrorism activities of germany ’ s 16 federal states with those of the central government in berlin . the new centralized agency should combine the tasks of police and intelligence services here and compile daily status reports .
fritz rudolf körper , otto schily ’ s right-hand man for counter-terrorism in the interior ministry , disagreed and said there 's no need for a new agency as two government-controlled risk assessment offices are currently being established . central office will bring coherance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the central office of the federal criminal agency in weisbaden .
" the two offices will be concentrating our staff ‘ s individual knowledge about islamic terrorism in a central location , " he explained .
" this will enable us to speed up and intensify the flow of information , while sticking to the principle of the separation of police and intelligence services . " under germany ’ s post-war constitution , police duties and intelligence activities can not be combined - a principle which harks back to the blatant civil rights abuses committed during the nazi period .
max stadler , justice expert for the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , vehemently opposes the cdu ’ s plans . balance between liberty and justice " it must be possible to combat terrorism and at the same time stick to the rule of law here , " he said .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

nevertheless , the bundesbank is sceptical that the eurozone 's biggest economy will be able to grow by that much and the german central bank is itself pencilling in gdp expansion of just 1.5 percent in 2005 , the newspaper said , without revealing its sources .
clement is scheduled to publish his updated growth forecasts next monday .
so far , berlin has predicted a range of 1.5-2.0 percent .
however , there appeared to be increasing signs that the upturn seen earlier this year - which has been driven primarily by robust exports - might be losing momentum as global growth also slows . earlier this week , germany 's top six economic research institutes announced they were anticipating a slowdown in german growth next year to 1.5 percent from an expected 1.8 percent this year .
nevertheless , the picture has been complicated by the fact that a fewer number of public holidays fell on weekdays this year , but that number would increase again next year , automatically clipping growth .
adjusted for the calendar effects , the bundesbank was forecasting growth of around 1.5 percent both this year and next year , ft deutschland said .

nevertheless , the bundesbank is sceptical that the eurozone 's biggest economy will be able to grow by that much and the german central bank is itself pencilling in gdp expansion of just 1.5 percent in 2005 , the newspaper said , without revealing its sources .
clement is scheduled to publish his updated growth forecasts next monday .
so far , berlin has predicted a range of 1.5-2.0 percent .
however , there appeared to be increasing signs that the upturn seen earlier this year - which has been driven primarily by robust exports - might be losing momentum as global growth also slows . earlier this week , germany 's top six economic research institutes announced they were anticipating a slowdown in german growth next year to 1.5 percent from an expected 1.8 percent this year .
nevertheless , the picture has been complicated by the fact that a fewer number of public holidays fell on weekdays this year , but that number would increase again next year , automatically clipping growth .
adjusted for the calendar effects , the bundesbank was forecasting growth of around 1.5 percent both this year and next year , ft deutschland said .

concerning safety , the autobahn has a lower death rate per million miles driven than countries with speed limits -lrb- for example , the us -rrb- .
as for an environmental position , the higher cost of fuel will most likely slow many drivers to conserve fuel .
the higher cost would cause people to drive less often and at a slower rate -lrb- self-regulating -rrb- .
the government should be more involved regulating auto emissions .

no more designing autos for limitless speeds for the road . - steve waldman if the conditions permit -lrb- good road , low traffic density , generally safe -rrb- then the driver should set the speed limit .
i live in australia where open road speed limit is 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and motorway speed limit is 110 kph and our people die of boredom on the roads .
as petrol prices rise most people will slow down to keep the cost down . - goran turner as a german-american who spent his childhood in germany , and has driven many kilometers on the autobahn as an adult , i have seen the germans give up more of their freedoms than would ever be acceptable in the us .
as justification , one always hears the same cry : necessity .
" give up your freedoms and we will make you safer , " has always been the mantra of the politician .
if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .
this would benefit everyone : the citizens of germany and the environment they pretend to care so much about . - cheryl boyd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?

the nation 's highest court dismissed his appeal , which had sought to force the government to release secret documents behind its decision to declare him a national security threat .
his case remains before the federal court in toronto , which is reviewing the secret documents , among other issues .
zundel , considered by jewish organization b 'nai brith to be one of the world 's leading publishers of anti-semitic and neo-nazi material , has been detained since february 19 , 2003 , after he was forced out of the united states for overstaying a visitor 's visa .
before going to the united states , zundel , a 65-year-old german national , had lived in canada since 1958 until shortly before a ruling by the canadian human rights tribunal in january 2002 that found him guilty of promoting hate on his internet site .
he is wanted in germany on charges of inciting hatred against jews . -lrb- afp -rrb- more briefs 21.10.2004 -pipe- written in english , about germany 21.10.2004 -pipe- berlin improves in battling corruption 20.10.2004 -pipe- survey shows germany winning corruption battle 20.10.2004 -pipe- " killer " klinsmann sick and tired of criticism 20.10.2004 -pipe- fischer : turkey in eu " d-day in terror war " 19.10.2004 -pipe- former president has emergency surgery 19.10.2004 -pipe- berlin drafts referendum legislation 19.10.2004 -pipe- bayern 's deisler depressed again radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .
der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .

paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .
der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .

according to a study by the french international relations institute -lrb- ifri -rrb- , quoted by die welt , berlin 's net contribution to the eu could rise to € 16 billion -lrb- $ 20.2 billion -rrb- a year by 2013 .
in 2002 , the net contribution of the union 's largest member state was € 7 billion ; this rose to € 9.5 billion last year .
the institution has based its calculations with the eu budget set at one percent of gross national income - something demanded by six of the biggest contributors to the eu budget , including germany .
it has also assumed that the british rebate is kept .
if the british rebate were to be scrapped , germany would be paying € 15.5 billion per year but with the rebate , the contribution would lie at € 16.2 billion .
however , should the british rebate be taken away and instead a general rebate for all member states put in place , then germany 's contribution would sink to € 14.1 billion .
the study does not include costs for eu-hopefuls such as turkey or croatia , noted the paper .
meanwhile , the financial times noted that germany , italy , portugal and greece are all at risk of breaching european union ceilings on budget deficits in 2005 .

for the eastern german city , a lot is at stake . dhl , a unit german mail carrier deutsche post , launched a review of its operations earlier this year covering a shake-up of its complexes in brussels and bonn . the company said thursday it had scrapped plans to expand operations in brussels with the loss of up to 1,700 jobs , after belgian politicians failed to resolve a row over night flights . with brussels no longer in the running , the two most likely locations for dhl 's international hub are vatry and leipzig .
" we 'll be making our decision in the next two to three weeks , " said dhl express chief for europe peter kruse . " leipzig can provide 24-service , " he added , and pointed out that the availability of qualified employees and generous state support - based on the € 70.8 million -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- the eu recently earmarked for leipzig - made the city an attractive option . the move would create several thousand new jobs and help secure existing positions at the leipzig airport . threatened government the brussels plans stalled on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of zaventem , brussels airport .
months of negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government . " dhl regrets that despite intensive involvement of the -lrb- belgian -rrb- government and major efforts by dhl , no official nor adequate proposal has been sent to the company 's management , " said dhl in a statement . " this will prevent dhl from implementing its long-term expansion plan at brussels national airport and from creating an intercontinental hub , " it added in a statement . strike action on the cards according to media reports , dhl workers have decided to launch strike action following the company 's decision , made at an extraordinary board meeting . dhl said it will continue with its current operations until 2008 , and then maintain a regional centre in brussels . among the measures which the courier company had been seeking was a doubling of the number of night flights allowed out of the belgian capital 's airport . on tuesday belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt urged dhl to consider replacing its noisier mcdonnell-douglas 11 cargo planes with quieter version by 2011 and not 2018 as the company had suggested . " we feel sorry but understand and respect the position of the involved governments , " said peter kruse .

for the eastern german city , a lot is at stake . dhl , a unit german mail carrier deutsche post , launched a review of its operations earlier this year covering a shake-up of its complexes in brussels and bonn . the company said thursday it had scrapped plans to expand operations in brussels with the loss of up to 1,700 jobs , after belgian politicians failed to resolve a row over night flights . with brussels no longer in the running , the two most likely locations for dhl 's international hub are vatry and leipzig .
" we 'll be making our decision in the next two to three weeks , " said dhl express chief for europe peter kruse . " leipzig can provide 24-service , " he added , and pointed out that the availability of qualified employees and generous state support - based on the € 70.8 million -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- the eu recently earmarked for leipzig - made the city an attractive option . the move would create several thousand new jobs and help secure existing positions at the leipzig airport . threatened government the brussels plans stalled on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of zaventem , brussels airport .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .

unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not .

" we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .
vfb demolished ujpest 7-1 in their last uefa cup contest to advance to the group stages . aachen shock french high-flyers lille bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's european dream continues .
while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .
schalke 04 were unlucky not to make it three out of three for the germany in the uefa cup after going ahead in the arena aufschalke after just eight minutes in their group a opener with basel . levan kobiashvili gave the hosts a blistering start with a spectacular opening goal , bulging the roof of the net with a blistering shot from the edge of the box , and the royal blues continued to dominate the proceedings until midway through the second half . but the one-goal advantage was already beginning to look under threat before argentine midfielder mathias emilio delgado unleashed his own text book thunderbolt with a curling free-kick which evaded the defensive wall and flew into the corner of frank rost 's goal . schalke coach ralf rangnick will be ruing his team 's inability to finish the swiss off even after he sent on ailton and mike hanke in a four-man attack . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .
vfb demolished ujpest 7-1 in their last uefa cup contest to advance to the group stages . aachen shock french high-flyers lille bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's european dream continues .
while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .
schalke 04 were unlucky not to make it three out of three for the germany in the uefa cup after going ahead in the arena aufschalke after just eight minutes in their group a opener with basel . levan kobiashvili gave the hosts a blistering start with a spectacular opening goal , bulging the roof of the net with a blistering shot from the edge of the box , and the royal blues continued to dominate the proceedings until midway through the second half . but the one-goal advantage was already beginning to look under threat before argentine midfielder mathias emilio delgado unleashed his own text book thunderbolt with a curling free-kick which evaded the defensive wall and flew into the corner of frank rost 's goal . schalke coach ralf rangnick will be ruing his team 's inability to finish the swiss off even after he sent on ailton and mike hanke in a four-man attack . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .
vfb demolished ujpest 7-1 in their last uefa cup contest to advance to the group stages . aachen shock french high-flyers lille bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's european dream continues .
while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .

i pretend to be a diva .
if i do n't want to sing , then i listen to classical , like beethoven .
if i have others in the car , we talk and keep good company .
if i am the passenger , i knit . - anna hallquist i have audio tapes to listen to , or i listen to talk shows on the radio .
sometimes , i have a book with me ; i read half of the da vinci code in my car , waiting at long stop lights and in traffic jams .
sometimes , the guy behind me honks to get me to move because i get so wrapped up in the novel i 'm reading , but that usually does n't happen very often .
i used to get really worked up during traffic jams , but noticed my increased blood pressure and anxiety levels .
now i know that no traffic jam is worth having a heart attack over it . - vernon i listen to recorded books , most recently the harry potter series .
being read to is very soothing and i do n't mind the commute taking longer because i get to hear more of the story .
i commute 55 miles -lrb- 88.5 kilometers -rrb- each way which takes between 70 and 90 minutes . - david i listen to books on cds .
almost all of the best selling books are now available on audio .
i download most of them off the internet .
i also listen to college courses .
since i commute at least six to seven hours per week , i get through a lot of courses and books . - daryl nitkowski your article on killer commutes was enlightening .
unfortunately i smoke and drink coffee while in traffic . - paul harris remember to breathe .
listen to cds of teachers of compassion , like pema chodron .
look at the people also stuck in traffic alongside me and try to identify / have compassion for them ; they all have lives too , complete with joy and pain .
recite a mantra , any compassionate mantra ... make one up just for the freeway .
try to remember i 'm exactly where i am ; frustration changes nothing in a situation over which i have no control .
besides , there will be plenty to get angry about when i finally arrive home . - mona mansfield erhardt i am often stuck in traffic in boston .
i have taken to bringing a novel or magazine or puzzles .
either way , when all i am doing is sitting , parked , i am less frustrated .
instead i can sit back and relax . - margaret langdell most of the time in traffic jams is spent reading road signs , printed matter like mailings which i normally throw away .
i listen to cds with classic music and smile at other drivers who are getting frustrated .
i am to old to get upset for every set back .
i do make sure that my air conditioning is always in good working order , so i do n't get irritated .
of course i live in texas where there is always a tomorrow for those that take live as it comes . - frans de jong i work at the university of manitoba , a 10 kilometer -lrb- 6 mile -rrb- commute .
i like to bicycle to work , it is much more relaxing than driving . - odd bres , winnipeg , canada i sing along to " careless whisper " by george michael as loud as i can until my voice starts to die out .
then when i arrive at my destination i have this really cool raspy voice that the chicks dig .
however , i sometimes get painful cramps doing this , and twice i 've come extremely close to throwing up in the grocery bags on the front passenger seat . - patrick t. i listen to music .
i make sure that i keep a variety of cds ready to go .
a mellow one , a fast-paced one , a few positive upbeat songs that i really like .
also , it 's important to change music often to keep me interested .
so when traffic is a nightmare , i sing along to my favorite songs . - kl holloway s peed limits on the autobahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that imposing speed limits on the autobahn is an unnecessary restriction .
concerning safety , the autobahn has a lower death rate per million miles driven than countries with speed limits -lrb- for example , the us -rrb- .
as for an environmental position , the higher cost of fuel will most likely slow many drivers to conserve fuel .
the higher cost would cause people to drive less often and at a slower rate -lrb- self-regulating -rrb- .
the government should be more involved regulating auto emissions .
as a californian , our state has been so involved in auto emissions that our regulations have affected the world 's auto manufactures .
and finally , the mystique of german automobile engineering would be lost should a speed limit be imposed .
no more designing autos for limitless speeds for the road . - steve waldman if the conditions permit -lrb- good road , low traffic density , generally safe -rrb- then the driver should set the speed limit .
i live in australia where open road speed limit is 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and motorway speed limit is 110 kph and our people die of boredom on the roads .
as petrol prices rise most people will slow down to keep the cost down . - goran turner as a german-american who spent his childhood in germany , and has driven many kilometers on the autobahn as an adult , i have seen the germans give up more of their freedoms than would ever be acceptable in the us .
as justification , one always hears the same cry : necessity .
" give up your freedoms and we will make you safer , " has always been the mantra of the politician .
if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .
this would benefit everyone : the citizens of germany and the environment they pretend to care so much about . - cheryl boyd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?

his stubbornness is leading to a head-on collision between european institutions - a collision whose outcome is uncertain , apart from the fact that it will do italy no good whatsoever . in belgium de morgen said if the barroso commission is approved by parliament , which is still possible in spite of all the growling , then we will have proof that europe is not preoccupied with european ideals , but with national interests .
let us not fool ourselves .
german social democrats are not going to vote down a commission in which fellow countryman and party member günter verheugen has a key position .
the british have probably received instructions to vote for blair 's close ally peter mandelson and many belgium liberals will hardly dare to mess things up for louis michel .
but for years , the belgium paper continued , the european parliament has grumbled that it is not taken seriously .

paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .

in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .

following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

" carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .
-lrb- october 21 , 2004 -rrb- germany and britain warn iran the foreign ministers of britain and germany issued a joint warning to iran on tuesday to address international worries about its nuclear program , serving notice that tehran must take action immediately .
-lrb- october 20 , 2004 -rrb- eu launches last ditch iran plan eu officials have launched a final bid to persuade iran to comply with international nuclear guidelines in an attempt to save the islamic state from being hauled in front of the un security council .
-lrb- october 16 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is the european union being too soft on iran or is " constructive dialogue " the best option ?

" leipzig can provide 24-service , " he added , and pointed out that the availability of qualified employees and generous state support - based on the € 70.8 million -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- the eu recently earmarked for leipzig - made the city an attractive option . the move would create several thousand new jobs and help secure existing positions at the leipzig airport . threatened government the brussels plans stalled on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of zaventem , brussels airport .
months of negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government . " dhl regrets that despite intensive involvement of the -lrb- belgian -rrb- government and major efforts by dhl , no official nor adequate proposal has been sent to the company 's management , " said dhl in a statement . " this will prevent dhl from implementing its long-term expansion plan at brussels national airport and from creating an intercontinental hub , " it added in a statement . strike action on the cards according to media reports , dhl workers have decided to launch strike action following the company 's decision , made at an extraordinary board meeting . dhl said it will continue with its current operations until 2008 , and then maintain a regional centre in brussels . among the measures which the courier company had been seeking was a doubling of the number of night flights allowed out of the belgian capital 's airport . on tuesday belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt urged dhl to consider replacing its noisier mcdonnell-douglas 11 cargo planes with quieter version by 2011 and not 2018 as the company had suggested . " we feel sorry but understand and respect the position of the involved governments , " said peter kruse .
" we thank prime minister verhofstadt and the other parties for their involvement and continuous efforts to make this considerable investment possible in brussels .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

dw-world readers share their road relaxation secrets while others comment on speed limits on german autobahns . if i am alone , i sing along to music on the radio or on cd .
my favorite ?
aretha franklin !
i pretend to be a diva .
if i do n't want to sing , then i listen to classical , like beethoven .
if i have others in the car , we talk and keep good company .
if i am the passenger , i knit . - anna hallquist i have audio tapes to listen to , or i listen to talk shows on the radio .
sometimes , i have a book with me ; i read half of the da vinci code in my car , waiting at long stop lights and in traffic jams .
sometimes , the guy behind me honks to get me to move because i get so wrapped up in the novel i 'm reading , but that usually does n't happen very often .
i used to get really worked up during traffic jams , but noticed my increased blood pressure and anxiety levels .
now i know that no traffic jam is worth having a heart attack over it . - vernon i listen to recorded books , most recently the harry potter series .
being read to is very soothing and i do n't mind the commute taking longer because i get to hear more of the story .
i commute 55 miles -lrb- 88.5 kilometers -rrb- each way which takes between 70 and 90 minutes . - david i listen to books on cds .
almost all of the best selling books are now available on audio .
i download most of them off the internet .
i also listen to college courses .
since i commute at least six to seven hours per week , i get through a lot of courses and books . - daryl nitkowski your article on killer commutes was enlightening .
unfortunately i smoke and drink coffee while in traffic . - paul harris remember to breathe .
listen to cds of teachers of compassion , like pema chodron .
look at the people also stuck in traffic alongside me and try to identify / have compassion for them ; they all have lives too , complete with joy and pain .
recite a mantra , any compassionate mantra ... make one up just for the freeway .
try to remember i 'm exactly where i am ; frustration changes nothing in a situation over which i have no control .
besides , there will be plenty to get angry about when i finally arrive home . - mona mansfield erhardt i am often stuck in traffic in boston .
i have taken to bringing a novel or magazine or puzzles .
either way , when all i am doing is sitting , parked , i am less frustrated .
instead i can sit back and relax . - margaret langdell most of the time in traffic jams is spent reading road signs , printed matter like mailings which i normally throw away .
i listen to cds with classic music and smile at other drivers who are getting frustrated .
i am to old to get upset for every set back .
i do make sure that my air conditioning is always in good working order , so i do n't get irritated .
of course i live in texas where there is always a tomorrow for those that take live as it comes . - frans de jong i work at the university of manitoba , a 10 kilometer -lrb- 6 mile -rrb- commute .
i like to bicycle to work , it is much more relaxing than driving . - odd bres , winnipeg , canada i sing along to " careless whisper " by george michael as loud as i can until my voice starts to die out .
then when i arrive at my destination i have this really cool raspy voice that the chicks dig .
however , i sometimes get painful cramps doing this , and twice i 've come extremely close to throwing up in the grocery bags on the front passenger seat . - patrick t. i listen to music .
i make sure that i keep a variety of cds ready to go .
a mellow one , a fast-paced one , a few positive upbeat songs that i really like .
also , it 's important to change music often to keep me interested .
so when traffic is a nightmare , i sing along to my favorite songs . - kl holloway s peed limits on the autobahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that imposing speed limits on the autobahn is an unnecessary restriction .
concerning safety , the autobahn has a lower death rate per million miles driven than countries with speed limits -lrb- for example , the us -rrb- .
as for an environmental position , the higher cost of fuel will most likely slow many drivers to conserve fuel .
the higher cost would cause people to drive less often and at a slower rate -lrb- self-regulating -rrb- .
the government should be more involved regulating auto emissions .
as a californian , our state has been so involved in auto emissions that our regulations have affected the world 's auto manufactures .
and finally , the mystique of german automobile engineering would be lost should a speed limit be imposed .
no more designing autos for limitless speeds for the road . - steve waldman if the conditions permit -lrb- good road , low traffic density , generally safe -rrb- then the driver should set the speed limit .
i live in australia where open road speed limit is 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and motorway speed limit is 110 kph and our people die of boredom on the roads .
as petrol prices rise most people will slow down to keep the cost down . - goran turner as a german-american who spent his childhood in germany , and has driven many kilometers on the autobahn as an adult , i have seen the germans give up more of their freedoms than would ever be acceptable in the us .
as justification , one always hears the same cry : necessity .
" give up your freedoms and we will make you safer , " has always been the mantra of the politician .
if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .
this would benefit everyone : the citizens of germany and the environment they pretend to care so much about . - cheryl boyd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?
if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute . "
-lrb- oct .
22 , 2004 -rrb- putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .
it will now be difficult for the united states government to continue giving the international climate protection treaty the cold shoulder - not matter who the future american president is . jens thurau -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu welcomes russian kyoto approval the european commission on thursday welcomed the approval by russia 's cabinet of the kyoto protocol thursday , claiming it was a " victory " for the european union which has pushed moscow hard on the issue .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .

" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

dw-world readers share their road relaxation secrets while others comment on speed limits on german autobahns . if i am alone , i sing along to music on the radio or on cd .
my favorite ?
aretha franklin !
i pretend to be a diva .
if i do n't want to sing , then i listen to classical , like beethoven .
if i have others in the car , we talk and keep good company .
if i am the passenger , i knit . - anna hallquist i have audio tapes to listen to , or i listen to talk shows on the radio .
sometimes , i have a book with me ; i read half of the da vinci code in my car , waiting at long stop lights and in traffic jams .
sometimes , the guy behind me honks to get me to move because i get so wrapped up in the novel i 'm reading , but that usually does n't happen very often .
i used to get really worked up during traffic jams , but noticed my increased blood pressure and anxiety levels .
now i know that no traffic jam is worth having a heart attack over it . - vernon i listen to recorded books , most recently the harry potter series .
being read to is very soothing and i do n't mind the commute taking longer because i get to hear more of the story .
i commute 55 miles -lrb- 88.5 kilometers -rrb- each way which takes between 70 and 90 minutes . - david i listen to books on cds .
almost all of the best selling books are now available on audio .
i download most of them off the internet .
i also listen to college courses .
since i commute at least six to seven hours per week , i get through a lot of courses and books . - daryl nitkowski your article on killer commutes was enlightening .
unfortunately i smoke and drink coffee while in traffic . - paul harris remember to breathe .
listen to cds of teachers of compassion , like pema chodron .
look at the people also stuck in traffic alongside me and try to identify / have compassion for them ; they all have lives too , complete with joy and pain .
recite a mantra , any compassionate mantra ... make one up just for the freeway .
try to remember i 'm exactly where i am ; frustration changes nothing in a situation over which i have no control .
besides , there will be plenty to get angry about when i finally arrive home . - mona mansfield erhardt i am often stuck in traffic in boston .
i have taken to bringing a novel or magazine or puzzles .
either way , when all i am doing is sitting , parked , i am less frustrated .
instead i can sit back and relax . - margaret langdell most of the time in traffic jams is spent reading road signs , printed matter like mailings which i normally throw away .
i listen to cds with classic music and smile at other drivers who are getting frustrated .
i am to old to get upset for every set back .
i do make sure that my air conditioning is always in good working order , so i do n't get irritated .
of course i live in texas where there is always a tomorrow for those that take live as it comes . - frans de jong i work at the university of manitoba , a 10 kilometer -lrb- 6 mile -rrb- commute .
i like to bicycle to work , it is much more relaxing than driving . - odd bres , winnipeg , canada i sing along to " careless whisper " by george michael as loud as i can until my voice starts to die out .
then when i arrive at my destination i have this really cool raspy voice that the chicks dig .
however , i sometimes get painful cramps doing this , and twice i 've come extremely close to throwing up in the grocery bags on the front passenger seat . - patrick t. i listen to music .
i make sure that i keep a variety of cds ready to go .
a mellow one , a fast-paced one , a few positive upbeat songs that i really like .
also , it 's important to change music often to keep me interested .
so when traffic is a nightmare , i sing along to my favorite songs . - kl holloway s peed limits on the autobahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that imposing speed limits on the autobahn is an unnecessary restriction .
concerning safety , the autobahn has a lower death rate per million miles driven than countries with speed limits -lrb- for example , the us -rrb- .
as for an environmental position , the higher cost of fuel will most likely slow many drivers to conserve fuel .
the higher cost would cause people to drive less often and at a slower rate -lrb- self-regulating -rrb- .
the government should be more involved regulating auto emissions .
as a californian , our state has been so involved in auto emissions that our regulations have affected the world 's auto manufactures .
and finally , the mystique of german automobile engineering would be lost should a speed limit be imposed .
no more designing autos for limitless speeds for the road . - steve waldman if the conditions permit -lrb- good road , low traffic density , generally safe -rrb- then the driver should set the speed limit .
i live in australia where open road speed limit is 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and motorway speed limit is 110 kph and our people die of boredom on the roads .
as petrol prices rise most people will slow down to keep the cost down . - goran turner as a german-american who spent his childhood in germany , and has driven many kilometers on the autobahn as an adult , i have seen the germans give up more of their freedoms than would ever be acceptable in the us .
as justification , one always hears the same cry : necessity .
" give up your freedoms and we will make you safer , " has always been the mantra of the politician .
if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .
this would benefit everyone : the citizens of germany and the environment they pretend to care so much about . - cheryl boyd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?
if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute . "
-lrb- oct .
22 , 2004 -rrb- putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ?
while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.10.2004 france forges ahead with nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to build a new generation of reactors flamanville on normandy 's atlantic coast is already home to one nuclear facility , and it 's about to get another .
paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .
der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .

they suggested moves aimed at amalgamating the various anti-terrorism activities at regional and national level . about three years ago , germans were shocked to learn that nearly all the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks against the united states had planned their crime while living undisturbed in the north german city of hamburg . this year two close associates of the 9/11 terrorist chief mohammed atta had to be released after german prosecutors were unable to present water-tight cases against them .
dramatic failures like these , said germany ’ s conservative opposition , are clear evidence of the rampant incompetence of germany ’ s anti-terrorism structures . clemens bininger , a security spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the spd-green coalition has failed in its role in the war on terror to date .
" since the government has no successes to present , all it can do is cry out for greater powers , " he told reporters . separation weakens information flow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" interior minister otto schily wants to tighten his grip on regional authorities .
but the separation of regional and central structures in crime fighting is not the problem .
the bottleneck is clearly a lack of coordination and an insufficient and bureaucratic flow of information among them . " the cdu has complained that the exchange of information among a staggering 37 anti-terrorism authorities in germany can sometimes take up to four weeks .
the conservatives now want to combine the anti-terrorism activities of germany ’ s 16 federal states with those of the central government in berlin . the new centralized agency should combine the tasks of police and intelligence services here and compile daily status reports .
fritz rudolf körper , otto schily ’ s right-hand man for counter-terrorism in the interior ministry , disagreed and said there 's no need for a new agency as two government-controlled risk assessment offices are currently being established . central office will bring coherance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the central office of the federal criminal agency in weisbaden .
" the two offices will be concentrating our staff ‘ s individual knowledge about islamic terrorism in a central location , " he explained .
" this will enable us to speed up and intensify the flow of information , while sticking to the principle of the separation of police and intelligence services . " under germany ’ s post-war constitution , police duties and intelligence activities can not be combined - a principle which harks back to the blatant civil rights abuses committed during the nazi period .
max stadler , justice expert for the neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , vehemently opposes the cdu ’ s plans . balance between liberty and justice " it must be possible to combat terrorism and at the same time stick to the rule of law here , " he said .
" if we are going to jettison our legal principles in this fight we can just as well give up discussing the protection of privacy rights in this parliament and allow security services to gather information however they want . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda court case in frankfurt terrorism experts believe that germany is home to about 30,000 militant muslim fundamentalists organized in a loose network of 24 groupings .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .

it is a victory for politics , says dw 's jens thurau . for environmentalists around the world , friday was a day worthy of celebration : after years of waiting , russia finally agreed to ratify the kyoto protocol on global warming .
as the 29th of 36 large industrial countries , the signing of the international climate treaty by the russian parliament , or duma , means the un accord will finally go into effect worldwide .
after the united states pulled out of the treaty in 2001 , all eyes turned to moscow in the hopes that the giant polluter , which accounts for 17 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions , would sign onto the protocol and push it into action .
unlike other international accords , the 1997 protocol required more than a simple majority of signatory countries : it required ratification by countries constituting 55 percent of global emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories and car exhaust contribute to moscow 's high smog levels for years the other signatory nations , particularly in europe , waited for russian approval to set the treaty into action .
and now after ratification by the duma and president vladimir putin 's signature , the kyoto protocol sends a signal around the world that goes far beyond environmental protection : the international community has demonstrated it is capable of a multilateral approach , despite strong opposition from the united states .
a watered down version in all honesty , little remains of the ambitious pledges to climate protection that formed the basis of the kyoto protocol when it was first drafted seven years ago in japan .
at that time , the industrial nations had promised to reduce by 5 percent their greenhouse gases by the year 2010 .
however , since then the majority of countries have instead increased their emissions , and the protocol itself has been watered down at numerous climate conferences since kyoto - most notoriously through the accrediting of forest space with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries are given " credit " for the amount of forest space they have .
the idea is that forest and trees help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment .
in the end , even skeptics , who worried more about the economic impact of the reductions , could endorse the protocol - much to the chagrin of environmentalists who fear the treaty as it stands now will at best lead to a stagnation of emissions .
that 's less than sufficient , but more than nothing .
setting cooperation in motion for now , what 's important is that the pact sets new forms of international cooperation in motion .
wealthy nations , for instance , can finance projects to develop alternative energy sources in poorer countries and thus gain credit to be used against their own emission reduction requirements .
in the european union , trade with emission rights , so-called carbon credits , will go into effect shortly , whereby countries can trade among each other for the right to pollute .
moreover , the ratification of the kyoto protocol also paves the way for the most important climate negotiations in the coming years , when threshold nations such as china and india - who at the moment are not held accountable for their own emissions - will be required to contribute to the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-powered electricity system set up in a village in morocco in conjunction with totalfinaelf company international contracts , once implemented , often develop their own dynamic .
that has been the case in the past , and with the kyoto protocol , environmentalists hope it will help direct the focus away from fossil fuels and towards developing alternative energy sources .
an accomplishment for politics measured against the expectations of climate researchers and environmentalists , friday 's ratification and the now-certain implementation of the kyoto protocol may fall short of what they originally hoped to accomplish .
but measured against the expectations and realities of politics , the accomplishment is considerably higher than what might have occurred .

a german car was transporting a miniature shetland pony in the backseat - reason enough for a hefty fine . dutch police stopped a german driver on thursday after a diligent citizen and animal lover reported seeing a shetland pony crammed into the backseat of a compact car .
" the small shetland pony had no room to move and his head was pressed against the window , " a police spokeswoman told reuters .
the small horse , not much bigger than a large dog , was tied to a rope and forced into the hatchback of a volkswagen polo .
the police fined the 42-year-old german € 220 -lrb- $ 277 -rrb- for improper transport of the animal , which the driver claimed to have just bought at a market in the netherlands on the way back home to germany .
" once the driver has obtained an export certificate , the pony can go to germany , " police said .
in some countries like the united states , shetland ponies are being used increasingly as guide horses for the blind .
because they live three times longer than the more common seeing-eye dogs and do n't shed , the miniature ponies are much sought after .
they are a fairly rare sight in germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu introduces passports for pets the eu tends to take offence at the suggestion that some of its rules are a bit silly , but brussels bureaucrats will just have to grin and bear it when complaints roll in on their latest decree : passports for pets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.10.2004 france forges ahead with nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to build a new generation of reactors flamanville on normandy 's atlantic coast is already home to one nuclear facility , and it 's about to get another .
paris plans to start building the first of a new generation of nuclear plants in 2007 . well above the european average , france derives almost 80 percent of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors .
the country 's first atomic power station began operating near colmar , close to the german border , in 1977 .
now , almost thirty years on , france has had to decide whether to replace its ageing nuclear plants or follow in germany 's footsteps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das atomkraftwerk stade an der elbe , undatierte aufnahme .
der zweitgrößte deutsche stromversorger e.on hat am 10.10.2000 die vorzeitige stilllegung des reaktors als erstem deutschen atomkraftwerk nach den energiekonsensgesprächen für 2003 bekannt gegeben .
in 2000 , germany became the first leading economic power officially to announce plans to phase out use of nuclear energy .
the country 's second-largest plant , at stade on the elbe -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was the first to go . but france has taken an entirely different approach . the german factor experts say the new french reactors , known as the european pressurized water reactor , are more efficient , safer and environmentally sound than the current models .
much to the chagrin of berlin 's environmentalist greens , german company siemens and french firm areva have been developing the epr prototype since 1992 . but the decision to go ahead with the project in flamanville announced thursday is good news for the joint siemens-areva subsidiary framatome in erlangen , germany , which employs some 1,600 staff . " it will have a positive effect on the region 's job market , " said company spokesman christian wilson friday . cheaper , stronger , better ? the plant , expected to cost at least € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.8 billion -rrb- , " will help guarantee european independence over the next few decades " said pierre gadonneix , president of electricité de france .
energy supply is a serious concern in a country with limited domestic energy resources and therefore reliant on imports .
it 's one reason why the government has traditionally supported investment in nuclear power . edf pointed out that the 2nd generation reactors could generate 1600 megawatts of electricity , compared to 900 for current reactors , need less regular recharging and have a life-span of 60 years .
the company also claims that they would be able to withstand the impact of an aircraft flown by terrorists . the center-right government , meanwhile , argues that epr is the most strategic response to the rising cost of oil . swimming against the eco-tide critics of the plan , however , argue that investing in nuclear power has had its day . " this technology is obselete for political reasons that have no connection with a rational , properly thought-out energy policy , " said a statement by the french office of environmental group greenpeace . surveys also show that a growing percentage of the french population would like to see an end to use of nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister nikolas sarkozy of france answers questions while arriving at the start of the informal european union finance ministers meeting in the hague , the netherlands , friday sept 10 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fred ernst -rrb- flamanville as site of the new plant was chosen by prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- because the region supports use of nuclear energy .
the alternative location , penly near dieppe , was ruled out in reaction to local protests . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . -lrb- july 4 , 2004 -rrb- france plans for its energy future nuclear energy still provides france with most of its energy , but the country is looking at alternative sources for the future .
the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . -lrb- july 1 , 2004 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.10.2004 us skeptical of iran-eu nuke talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles suggest further dialogue but the us is not convinced iran 's decision thursday to pursue talks with europe 's three major powers over its nuclear ambitions prompted a suspicious response from the united states which favors direct compliance with united nations regulations . representatives of britain , france and germany met with iranian officials in vienna on thursday to ask tehran to reassure the world that it was not secretly developing atomic weapons .
iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .
" i do n't know if it 'll come today .
i do n't know if will come tomorrow .
unfortunately , history would lead us to think that the answer 's going to be no . " washington wants the iaea , which since february 2003 has been investigating iran on us claims that the islamic republic has a covert nuclear weapons program , to send iran before the un security council , which could impose sanctions . the us has said it will push the iaea governing board to refer the matter to the security council at its next meeting on november 25 if iran has not agreed to the agency 's demands .
boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .
" if it 's not a yes , and it 's not a yes by november , then clearly we 'll be facing a situation in the board where everybody knows that iran has failed to comply and -lrb- they -rrb- should be referred further to the un security council , " he said .
" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not . " carrot and stick " measures on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans are now ready to promise iran a range of measures , including access to nuclear fuel for its civilian reactors and recognizing iran 's right to a peaceful nuclear power program , according to a seven-page confidential paper the trio presented to the g8 group of industrialized nations last week in washington . " we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .
however , the eu plan has limits .
if iran does not carry out a full , verified suspension of enrichment , the european trio would join the united states in calling for it to be hauled before the security council , the confidential paper said . the europeans said they were prepared to go even further and " if an initial political call to iran were not successful , the security council could then consider making the suspension mandatory .
it could also consider strengthening the powers of the iaea to carry out inspections in iran , " the document added . the next step would be sanctions under article 41 of the un charter , the europeans said , adding however that " we do not need to consider that in more detail at this stage . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran will consider eu nuclear offer iranian and european officials did n't reach a deal thursday , but tehran will consider an eu offer which will enable it to receive nuclear technology in exchange for abandoning its weapons program .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days .

"
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

iran responded by suggesting dialogue with the eu trio on the contentious subject of its nuclear ambitions would continue in the coming days . " we are at an initial stage , matters have to be considered on both sides , " said sirus naseri , a consultant to the iranian delegation . speaking to reporters after the two sides met for three hours in vienna , naseri said : " what has been agreed is that we will continue the dialogue . "
he added , " i think we 'll get together in a matter of a few days . "
naseri said the next meeting might also be in vienna . however , the united states responded with suspicion to iran 's response , refusing to comment on the european offer or whether iran would accept it , saying it was interested only in whether tehran would meet its obligations to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . " the important thing about the meeting is what the iranians say now ... as to whether or not , yes or no , they are going to comply with the requirements of the international atomic energy agency board of directors , " state department spokesman richard boucher said . history of suspicion " that 's what we 'll be looking for , " he told reporters .

boucher reiterated that stance on thursday , saying that it was up to iran to provide the right answer if it wants to avoid such a referral . november deadline in us sights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us state department spokesman richard boucher .

" that 's the question .
the question is on the iranian side . " the united states appeared resolute that iran should comply with the iaea and that any other dealing would detract from the issue surrounding compliance with the un nuclear watchdog .
washington has frowned on the incentives offered by britain , france and germany ; the same incentives which brought iran back into discussions on thursday . according to a confidential text obtained by news agency afp and confirmed by diplomats in vienna , britain , france and germany made the offer of valuable nuclear technology if tehran complies and threatening possible un sanctions if it does not .

" we would support the acquisition by iran of a light water research reactor , " the paper said , adding that the eu would " be ready to resume negotiations on an eu / iran trade and cooperation agreement , " and back russia 's building of a nuclear reactor for iran . the european trio has so far opposed the us favored strategy of using the un route as the only incentive for dialogue , favoring instead a policy of " constructive engagement " to get tehran to cooperate . dialogue may make way for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council .

in fact , brits have made a point of not doing it while in the company of germans because of the sensitivity of the subject . but now , with queen elizabeth ii due in germany next month on a state visit , it is alleged that the germans are actively encouraging the monarch to disregard basil fawlty 's advice and " do mention the war . " a report in the conservative british newspaper daily express suggests that the queen , who will have talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler during her trip in the first week of november , is being put under pressure by the german government to apologize for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 . royal denials the royal family has denied any such pressure . " we have not been asked for an apology , " penny russell-smith , a royal spokesperson , told german news magazine der spiegel in response to the daily express headline : " germans want the queen to say sorry for war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii , second from right , grew up during the war .
russell-smith alluded to the queen 's own personal experience of the war and her sympathy to those affected by it . " the queen is very conscious of the suffering of all people during the war , " she said , adding that the queen had made a donation to the fund for the rebuilding of dresden 's monuments and will also take part in benefit concert to raise money for completing the city 's rebuilt frauenkirche while in germany . british press notes german memory loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demolished city of dresden is seen after the allied forces air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 .
meanwhile at home , the british paper made it very clear about how it felt about an apology . " it would be completely wrong if the queen apologized for the bombardment of german towns in the second world war or even for her to express regret , " the paper wrote in its editorial .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .

vfb demolished ujpest 7-1 in their last uefa cup contest to advance to the group stages . aachen shock french high-flyers lille bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's european dream continues .
while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .
schalke 04 were unlucky not to make it three out of three for the germany in the uefa cup after going ahead in the arena aufschalke after just eight minutes in their group a opener with basel . levan kobiashvili gave the hosts a blistering start with a spectacular opening goal , bulging the roof of the net with a blistering shot from the edge of the box , and the royal blues continued to dominate the proceedings until midway through the second half . but the one-goal advantage was already beginning to look under threat before argentine midfielder mathias emilio delgado unleashed his own text book thunderbolt with a curling free-kick which evaded the defensive wall and flew into the corner of frank rost 's goal . schalke coach ralf rangnick will be ruing his team 's inability to finish the swiss off even after he sent on ailton and mike hanke in a four-man attack . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .

after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german-british ties good , but still faulty traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding british and german kids struggle with clichés just do n't mention the war current affairs -pipe- 22.10.2004 do mention the war ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elizabeth ii has already made five official visits to germany a british newspaper has alleged that the german government is putting pressure on queen elizabeth ii to make a public apology for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 when she visits germany in november . in the minds of many thousands of britons , it is something they would never expect from the germans .
in fact , brits have made a point of not doing it while in the company of germans because of the sensitivity of the subject . but now , with queen elizabeth ii due in germany next month on a state visit , it is alleged that the germans are actively encouraging the monarch to disregard basil fawlty 's advice and " do mention the war . " a report in the conservative british newspaper daily express suggests that the queen , who will have talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and president horst köhler during her trip in the first week of november , is being put under pressure by the german government to apologize for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 . royal denials the royal family has denied any such pressure . " we have not been asked for an apology , " penny russell-smith , a royal spokesperson , told german news magazine der spiegel in response to the daily express headline : " germans want the queen to say sorry for war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii , second from right , grew up during the war .
russell-smith alluded to the queen 's own personal experience of the war and her sympathy to those affected by it . " the queen is very conscious of the suffering of all people during the war , " she said , adding that the queen had made a donation to the fund for the rebuilding of dresden 's monuments and will also take part in benefit concert to raise money for completing the city 's rebuilt frauenkirche while in germany . british press notes german memory loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demolished city of dresden is seen after the allied forces air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 .
meanwhile at home , the british paper made it very clear about how it felt about an apology . " it would be completely wrong if the queen apologized for the bombardment of german towns in the second world war or even for her to express regret , " the paper wrote in its editorial .
" lately , the germans have been keen to forget about history .
maybe they have forgotten that it was they who started the war . " germany has changed its attitude towards world war ii in recent times thanks to a leadership without any direct relationship with the war years that 's intent on moving away from the guilt complex that has dogged previous generations . john cleese line may be good advice but it may be prudent for the germans to stick to the fawlty towers line and not mention the war , especially as the queen 's husband , prince phillip , is accompanying her . the duke of edinburgh , a man who once asked a delegation of australian aborigines if they still threw spears at each other , is not renowned for his tolerance of foreigners or his tact . any attempt to extract an apology may prompt a re-enactment of a certain infamous " goose-stepping " scene from the unapologetic consort and a possible international crisis . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brits out of -lrb- goose -rrb- step with modern german image thousands of shocked britons return from germany amazed at not seeing a single example of " goose-stepping " .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .
vfb demolished ujpest 7-1 in their last uefa cup contest to advance to the group stages . aachen shock french high-flyers lille bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's european dream continues .
while stuttgart 's win was emphatic , aachen 's could be described as both surprising and uplifting .
the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .
schalke 04 were unlucky not to make it three out of three for the germany in the uefa cup after going ahead in the arena aufschalke after just eight minutes in their group a opener with basel . levan kobiashvili gave the hosts a blistering start with a spectacular opening goal , bulging the roof of the net with a blistering shot from the edge of the box , and the royal blues continued to dominate the proceedings until midway through the second half . but the one-goal advantage was already beginning to look under threat before argentine midfielder mathias emilio delgado unleashed his own text book thunderbolt with a curling free-kick which evaded the defensive wall and flew into the corner of frank rost 's goal . schalke coach ralf rangnick will be ruing his team 's inability to finish the swiss off even after he sent on ailton and mike hanke in a four-man attack . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enhance champions league chances victories for bayer leverkusen and werder bremen and an unlucky slip-up for bayern munich in the european champions league mean the german teams are still on course to progress to the knock-out stages .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

dw-world readers share their road relaxation secrets while others comment on speed limits on german autobahns . if i am alone , i sing along to music on the radio or on cd .
my favorite ?
aretha franklin !
i pretend to be a diva .
if i do n't want to sing , then i listen to classical , like beethoven .
if i have others in the car , we talk and keep good company .
if i am the passenger , i knit . - anna hallquist i have audio tapes to listen to , or i listen to talk shows on the radio .
sometimes , i have a book with me ; i read half of the da vinci code in my car , waiting at long stop lights and in traffic jams .
sometimes , the guy behind me honks to get me to move because i get so wrapped up in the novel i 'm reading , but that usually does n't happen very often .
i used to get really worked up during traffic jams , but noticed my increased blood pressure and anxiety levels .
now i know that no traffic jam is worth having a heart attack over it . - vernon i listen to recorded books , most recently the harry potter series .
being read to is very soothing and i do n't mind the commute taking longer because i get to hear more of the story .
i commute 55 miles -lrb- 88.5 kilometers -rrb- each way which takes between 70 and 90 minutes . - david i listen to books on cds .
almost all of the best selling books are now available on audio .
i download most of them off the internet .
i also listen to college courses .
since i commute at least six to seven hours per week , i get through a lot of courses and books . - daryl nitkowski your article on killer commutes was enlightening .
unfortunately i smoke and drink coffee while in traffic . - paul harris remember to breathe .
listen to cds of teachers of compassion , like pema chodron .
look at the people also stuck in traffic alongside me and try to identify / have compassion for them ; they all have lives too , complete with joy and pain .
recite a mantra , any compassionate mantra ... make one up just for the freeway .
try to remember i 'm exactly where i am ; frustration changes nothing in a situation over which i have no control .
besides , there will be plenty to get angry about when i finally arrive home . - mona mansfield erhardt i am often stuck in traffic in boston .
i have taken to bringing a novel or magazine or puzzles .
either way , when all i am doing is sitting , parked , i am less frustrated .
instead i can sit back and relax . - margaret langdell most of the time in traffic jams is spent reading road signs , printed matter like mailings which i normally throw away .
i listen to cds with classic music and smile at other drivers who are getting frustrated .
i am to old to get upset for every set back .
i do make sure that my air conditioning is always in good working order , so i do n't get irritated .
of course i live in texas where there is always a tomorrow for those that take live as it comes . - frans de jong i work at the university of manitoba , a 10 kilometer -lrb- 6 mile -rrb- commute .
i like to bicycle to work , it is much more relaxing than driving . - odd bres , winnipeg , canada i sing along to " careless whisper " by george michael as loud as i can until my voice starts to die out .
then when i arrive at my destination i have this really cool raspy voice that the chicks dig .
however , i sometimes get painful cramps doing this , and twice i 've come extremely close to throwing up in the grocery bags on the front passenger seat . - patrick t. i listen to music .
i make sure that i keep a variety of cds ready to go .
a mellow one , a fast-paced one , a few positive upbeat songs that i really like .
also , it 's important to change music often to keep me interested .
so when traffic is a nightmare , i sing along to my favorite songs . - kl holloway s peed limits on the autobahn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that imposing speed limits on the autobahn is an unnecessary restriction .
concerning safety , the autobahn has a lower death rate per million miles driven than countries with speed limits -lrb- for example , the us -rrb- .
as for an environmental position , the higher cost of fuel will most likely slow many drivers to conserve fuel .
the higher cost would cause people to drive less often and at a slower rate -lrb- self-regulating -rrb- .
the government should be more involved regulating auto emissions .
as a californian , our state has been so involved in auto emissions that our regulations have affected the world 's auto manufactures .
and finally , the mystique of german automobile engineering would be lost should a speed limit be imposed .
no more designing autos for limitless speeds for the road . - steve waldman if the conditions permit -lrb- good road , low traffic density , generally safe -rrb- then the driver should set the speed limit .
i live in australia where open road speed limit is 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- and motorway speed limit is 110 kph and our people die of boredom on the roads .
as petrol prices rise most people will slow down to keep the cost down . - goran turner as a german-american who spent his childhood in germany , and has driven many kilometers on the autobahn as an adult , i have seen the germans give up more of their freedoms than would ever be acceptable in the us .
as justification , one always hears the same cry : necessity .
" give up your freedoms and we will make you safer , " has always been the mantra of the politician .
if all the political rhetoric over the years had been true , then we should all be living in a completely safe world by now . - norman means , m.d. a safe speed would be 130 kph .
with two small children in my car at all times , i am very nervous on the autobahn with german cars whizzing by at over 100 mph .
this would benefit everyone : the citizens of germany and the environment they pretend to care so much about . - cheryl boyd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament .

the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together . " " that 's democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the greens have said that whatever the outcome , the incoming executive would be weakened by buttiglione 's inclusion and other controversial appointees in competition and farm policy .
" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them . health experts in germany are confident that the country is well-equipped to deal with this year 's influenza season and avoid crisis scenarios prompted by a shortage of flu shots like the one currently raging in the united states . susanne stöcker , a spokeswoman at the paul ehrlich institue -lrb- pei -rrb- , which is responsible for the approval and monitoring of the vaccines , told news agency afp on thursday that germany had around 20 million influenza vaccines for this year , four million more than last year . no us-like situations in the united states , where influenza kills 36,000 americans in an average year , only half the numbers of flu shots that are needed are currently available . the squeeze follows the closure of a factory of major vaccine supplier chipron corp. in liverpool by the british government due to contamination .
as a result , the us is estimated to face a crunch of around 48 million flu doses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stöcker said scarcity of flu shots such as in the united states was not likely to occur in germany .
that 's because unlike in the united states where one national authority is responsible for centrally ordering the shots , vaccine producers in germany can bring their shots , which have previously been approved , on to the market via wholesalers and pharmacies , stöcker told daily berliner zeitung .
at present , there are nine such companies manufacturing influenza shots in germany . stöcker also ruled out that the lack of flu shots in the us would trigger panic buying by the americans elsewhere and thus cause a worldwide shortage .
" first , the vaccine producers are bound to their customers through contracts , " stöcker said .
" second , the production of the influenza vaccine takes three months , " she added , saying that the us could only expect vaccine supplements by january . experts warn of high death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : influenza also known as flu , is caused by a virus that mainly attacks the upper respiratory tract .
it is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever , headache and cough , sore throat , and rhinitis .
most people recover within one to two weeks without requiring any medical treatment . in the very young , the elderly and people suffering from medical conditions such as lung diseases , diabetes , cancer , kidney or heart problems , influenza poses a serious risk .
in these people , the infection may lead to severe complications of underlying diseases , pneumonia and death . according to the world health organization , influenza viruses evolve rapidly , changing their antigenic characteristics , so that vaccines need to be modified each year to be effective against currently circulating influenza strains . experts in germany predict a hike in cases of the deadly influenza virus in the coming weeks following a relatively mild outbreak last year . the country recently registered its first influenza case this year .
andrea grüber of the marburg-based working group influenza told news agency ap this week that a munich-based man had caught the virus during a trip to spain . if the cases followed their usual development pattern , experts say germany could expect an influenza-related death toll of 5,000 to 8,000 this year .
if however , this year turns out to be as bad as the 2002/03 influenza season , the death toll could be as high as 20,000 to 30,000 , they warn . germans not taking danger seriously despite the staggeringly high numbers , not many germans seem to be taking the threat seriously . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a study carried out by berlin 's robert koch institut last november , the average influenza vaccination rate in germany was a mere 23.7 percent .
susanne stöcker of pei said that one of the main reasons for germans ' seeming reluctance to take the flu shots was their false understanding of the danger . " people often mistake dangerous influenza for the largely harmless normal flu with cough , cold and fever , " stöcker said . this carefree attitude had made influenza one of the most underestimated illnesses , stöcker added . however , figures show that high-risk groups such as those over the age of 60 , seem to be coming to their senses thanks to information campaigns . the robert koch institut study showed that those over 60 were comparatively well-protected against influenza by last november with 58 percent in eastern germany and 35 percent in the west having taken flu shots . still , health experts have stepped up warnings underlining the need to get vaccinated .

for the eastern german city , a lot is at stake . dhl , a unit german mail carrier deutsche post , launched a review of its operations earlier this year covering a shake-up of its complexes in brussels and bonn . the company said thursday it had scrapped plans to expand operations in brussels with the loss of up to 1,700 jobs , after belgian politicians failed to resolve a row over night flights . with brussels no longer in the running , the two most likely locations for dhl 's international hub are vatry and leipzig .
" we 'll be making our decision in the next two to three weeks , " said dhl express chief for europe peter kruse . " leipzig can provide 24-service , " he added , and pointed out that the availability of qualified employees and generous state support - based on the € 70.8 million -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- the eu recently earmarked for leipzig - made the city an attractive option . the move would create several thousand new jobs and help secure existing positions at the leipzig airport . threatened government the brussels plans stalled on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of zaventem , brussels airport .
months of negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government . " dhl regrets that despite intensive involvement of the -lrb- belgian -rrb- government and major efforts by dhl , no official nor adequate proposal has been sent to the company 's management , " said dhl in a statement . " this will prevent dhl from implementing its long-term expansion plan at brussels national airport and from creating an intercontinental hub , " it added in a statement . strike action on the cards according to media reports , dhl workers have decided to launch strike action following the company 's decision , made at an extraordinary board meeting . dhl said it will continue with its current operations until 2008 , and then maintain a regional centre in brussels . among the measures which the courier company had been seeking was a doubling of the number of night flights allowed out of the belgian capital 's airport . on tuesday belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt urged dhl to consider replacing its noisier mcdonnell-douglas 11 cargo planes with quieter version by 2011 and not 2018 as the company had suggested . " we feel sorry but understand and respect the position of the involved governments , " said peter kruse .

germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night . german teams saw european action as the uefa cup 's newly established group stage got underway .
following impressive displays by their compatriots in the champions league , vfb stuttgart , allemania aachen and schalke 04 added to the growing feeling that german clubs are regaining their confidence after recent embarrassing campaigns . bundesliga leaders stuttgart continued their impressive season by thrashing belgian outfit beveren 5-1 in the opening game of group g. a goal in each half from cacau gave stuttgart the impetus while kevin kuranyi , philipp lahm and imre szabics added the other goals to make it a night to remember for team and coach alike . vfb coach matthias sammer was branded a failure after struggling to get the best out of an expensively assembled , talented squad of players at borussia dortmund but the former germany international is proving his critics wrong as his new team go from strength to strength . stuttgart run riot over beveren bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau .
brazilian cacau gave his side the ideal start with a goal after nine minutes and the returning kevin kuranyi doubled the advantage five minutes before half-time .
cacau 's second gave the bundesliga leaders a three-goal cushion eight minutes after the restart and defender philipp lahm made the score line even more emphatic 13 minutes from time . ivory coast striker romaric n 'dri hit an 87th minute consolation free-kick for the hosts but it was never going to be enough for last season 's beaten belgian cup finalists and substitute imre szabics sealed the rout two minutes into injury time . it was a further indication that stuttgart have the hunger and desire to do well this season and have notched up impressive displays in the league so far and remain unbeaten after eight games .
their european form is also looking promising despite not having to face anyone who could be described as quality opposition .

the lowly second division club , enjoying their first european foray after finishing as runners-up in the dfb cup last season to double winners werder bremen , clinched the shock win of the opening stage by beating lille 1-0 . aachen , who played this match in fc köln 's rheinenergie stadium because their own was deemed to small , can thank their captain erik meijer for the group h victory against opposition which are currently flying high in second place in the french league after a run of six wins . aachen had most of the play during the first half and meijer and fellow strikers kai michalke and sergio pinto all had good chances to open the scoring in the first period .
the pressure continued in the second with simon rolfes and sichone bossing the midfield and aachen 's three-pronged attack forcing lille back . the breakthrough came after 53 minutes .
after many fruitless attempts at exploiting lille goalkeeper tony sylva 's vulnerability at set-pieces , aachen finally exposed the frenchman 's frailties with another free-kick .
sylva came for the cross but only managed to punch the ball straight to aachen 's landgraf , who crossed to the back post , where rolfes chipped the ball back for meijer to nod into the empty net . despite a late scare , aachen held on for a famous and well-deserved victory to keep their debut european campaign on track and the dream alive . victory just eludes schalke in 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlake let slip their group a game after taking a spectacular lead .

his stubbornness is leading to a head-on collision between european institutions - a collision whose outcome is uncertain , apart from the fact that it will do italy no good whatsoever . in belgium de morgen said if the barroso commission is approved by parliament , which is still possible in spite of all the growling , then we will have proof that europe is not preoccupied with european ideals , but with national interests .
let us not fool ourselves .
german social democrats are not going to vote down a commission in which fellow countryman and party member günter verheugen has a key position .
the british have probably received instructions to vote for blair 's close ally peter mandelson and many belgium liberals will hardly dare to mess things up for louis michel .
but for years , the belgium paper continued , the european parliament has grumbled that it is not taken seriously .
on wednesday it will a have first class opportunity to prove its worth .
if it fails to muster the courage , then meps wo n't have to bother to grumble anymore about being members of a pseudo-parliament .
the tages anzeiger in switzerland said meps may not like the last-minute minor changes to the commission barroso is proposing , but they should not the less give it their blessing .
a divided europe without leadership , the paper maintained , is in nobody 's interest .
the french paper liberation believes the vatican is fighting a dangerous rearguard action in a bid to wield influence in europe .
barroso has made a grave mistake in insisting on buttiglione as justice commissioner .
in this context , it is important to highlight the temporal character of european democracy - as a means of fending off all fundamentalists claiming superiority of moral laws over the rights of others .
it is vitally important for europe 's survival , the french paper said , that religion - whether the catholic faith or any other - remains contained within the church and a matter solely for individual conscience .
the german paper die welt believes that they can only be losers in the dispute between the european parliament and the commission .
the biggest loser the paper said will be the european parliament .
frustrated by limitations on its influence , it has started a power struggle with the commission , which is not only about buttiglione .
but it can not win .
there will be a majority for barroso and parliament will have made itself look ridiculous once again . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .

" such a commission would hardly survive the next five years , " greens co-leader daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters . european parliament president josep borrell also said that there was a possibility that a majority of the parliament would reject barroso 's team on wednesday . " that would mean that prodi would remain in office for a few weeks longer , " borrell told italian daily la repubblica on friday .
" it 's no war , no fight and not even a trial of power : that 's democracy , " borell said . european catholics peeved even as the row over the appropriateness of buttiglione 's nomination for justice chief simmers , the issue seems to be opening up new divides between devout european catholics and the european left . many catholics have been asking whether their views now are so politically incorrect as to keep them out of office .
in view of buttiglione 's credentials as a conservative italian catholic and a close friend of pope john paul , devout catholics have hit back at the european left 's assault on his comments on homosexuals and single women . the vatican has lashed out at italian communist paper il manifesto 's recent branding of catholics as " theo-cons " .
a senior cardinal at the vatican warned against " a new inquisition . " " this is the signal that believing christians ca n't apply for certain jobs within the eu , " catholic bishop joseph duffy of clogher in ireland told irish independent newspaper , accusing buttiglione 's critics of " pure intolerance .

barroso said buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , who infuriated many eu parliamentarians after he called homosexuality a sin and said that marriage existed to enable women to have children and the protection of a man , would be shadowed on human rights and discrimination issues .
" i 've asked parliament to take a balanced view of the project , of my commission , and i 'm very confident we 'll get the support of the clear majority of the members of the european parliament , " barroso said . barroso also furnished a letter penned by buttiglione , in which he apologized for offence caused in remarks made during his confirmation hearing before the parliament . " words so emotionally charged as sin should perhaps not be introduced into the political debate , " buttiglione wrote .
" i did not intend in any way to offend the feelings of anybody and , in particular , of women and homosexuals . " another post for buttiglione ? but , it still remains unclear whether barroso will be able to muster enough votes for his team of commissioners to be approved by a majority of the 732-member european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday .
the eu parliament vote is to approve or reject the entire commission .
meps can not veto individual commissioners .
without parliamentary approval , the commission can not take office on november 1 . though barroso is assured of the support of the conservatives , the largest group in parliament , he still has to convince the 200-strong socialist group .
socialist leader martin schulz said thursday that his group still wanted barroso replaced and would otherwise seek to rally a majority against barroso .
" the vast majority of my group will act as a bloc and the vote is going to be ' no ' , " schulz told reuters . he later suggested that buttiglione be given another post as a compromise .
" barroso has until next week , " schulz told german n-tv television .
" if he gives buttiglione another post , we can come together .

chris uncle , 24 , said harry had " burst " out of his car and " lunged " towards him , leaving him with a cut lip .
but a royal spokesman said prince harry had been hit in the face by a camera , and was trying to push it away .
harry - third in line to the throne - had been spending the evening at pangaea nightclub in london 's west end .
harry ' dragged off ' " prince harry was hit in the face by a camera when photographers crowded around him as he was getting into a car , " a royal spokesman said .
" in pushing the camera away , it 's understood that a photographer 's lip was cut . "
the incident comes just a week after a teacher accused the prince of cheating in his art a-level exam .
some newspaper reports suggested a member of the press pack had asked harry a question about his a-level just before the incident .
a scotland yard spokesman said police were aware of the nightclub incident but no complaint had been made .
" prince harry looked like he was inside the car and we were all still taking pictures , " mr uncle said .
" then suddenly he burst out of the car and lunged towards me as i was still taking pictures .
he lashed out and then deliberately pushed my camera into my face . "
the photographer claimed that royal bodyguards dragged the prince away .
' sudden reaction ' a witness , another press photographer charlie pycraft , told bbc news 24 that the prince had lunged at mr uncle .
" he was half-way getting into the back of the car when he suddenly reacted and lunged at him and grabbed his camera and pushed him against the wall . "
" every time harry goes out he is stalked , he is ambushed " dickie arbiter , former royal press secretary he said prince harry was restrained by his bodyguard and two doormen from the nightclub .
until recently , prince harry was relatively sheltered from media attention .
an informal agreement between royal officials and the media meant photographers left harry and his brother william alone to complete their education .
harry ' stalked ' a former royal press secretary , dickie arbiter , said a confrontation of some kind was bound to happen at some stage .
" every time harry goes out , he is stalked , he is ambushed and there is a little bit of intimidation in order for the paparazzi to get the right photograph and it was one of those things that was waiting to happen , " he told bbc news 24 .
have your say " the princes are entitled to privacy like anyone else " liz , brighton , uk mr arbiter said he could not remember any similar physical clashes between members of the royal family and the paparazzi .
" most people will agree that even a royal , and a 20-year-old one at that , is entitled to a little bit of privacy and at three o 'clock in the morning to be able to go home without having to worry about a photographer . "
in september , prince harry passed entrance exams to sandhurst military academy .
sacked eton art mistress sarah forsyth told an employment tribunal that she had helped the prince pass one of the a-levels he needed to get into sandhurst .
miss forsyth 's lawyers revealed that she had secretly recorded a conversation with the prince in which she claimed he admitted he had done little work on a coursework piece .
clarence house described the claims as " incredibly unfair " .

it is one of the worst mine accidents in recent years , and officials said the chances of the finding anyone still alive were slim .
thousands die in china 's poorly regulated mines each year , despite government promises to improve safety .
a bbc correspondent says such is the demand for coal that dangerous mines which are shut down quickly reopen .
more than 400 people were working in the daping mine in the city of xinmi , henan province , when the explosion happened late on wednesday .
coal demands china 's economic boom needs more and more power coal production rising by more than 15 % a year government crackdown on illegal and worst-run mines even so , more than 4,000 people killed in mining accidents so far this year more than 200 people escaped but 60 miners were confirmed dead , and rescuers were searching for survivors , xinhua news agency reported .
but sun huashan , deputy administrator of the state administration of work safety , said their chances for survival were " rather slim " .
the bureau supervising henan coal mine safety was also pessimistic .
" the situation is very tough in the mine , the gas is very dense , and in such conditions , it 's hard to survive , " an official at the bureau told the french news agency afp .
official figures released on thursday showed that 4,153 people died in mining accidents in china in the first three quarters of this year - a figure 13 % lower than last year 's .
however , the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , francis markus , says the total may be higher since some deaths go unreported .
these often occur in illegal , unregulated mines , which have mushroomed as china 's industrial revolution drives the country 's huge demand for coal .
dangers are compounded by a lack of investment for security in the state-owned mines , our correspondent says .

but sun huashan , deputy administrator of the state administration of work safety , said their chances for survival were " rather slim " .
the bureau supervising henan coal mine safety was also pessimistic .
" the situation is very tough in the mine , the gas is very dense , and in such conditions , it 's hard to survive , " an official at the bureau told the french news agency afp .
official figures released on thursday showed that 4,153 people died in mining accidents in china in the first three quarters of this year - a figure 13 % lower than last year 's .
however , the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , francis markus , says the total may be higher since some deaths go unreported .
these often occur in illegal , unregulated mines , which have mushroomed as china 's industrial revolution drives the country 's huge demand for coal .
dangers are compounded by a lack of investment for security in the state-owned mines , our correspondent says .

mr castro is in a plaster cast after three hours of surgery for fractures to his left knee and right arm , suffered during his fall at a rally .
he told cubans he had refused a general anaesthetic because he could not abandon his duties as head of state .
venezuela 's leftist leader , hugo chavez , has sent him his best wishes .
speaking to supporters in the venezuelan capital , caracas , the former paratrooper said his cuban counterpart had made light of the incident when they talked by telephone .
" i think i would have made a good parachutist , " mr castro , 78 , was quoted as saying .
correspondents say that the fall revives questions about who , or what , will eventually replace " fidel " , who has ruled with an iron grip since the revolution .
' little concern ' the us state department appeared to be in no mood to show sympathy for a communist revolutionary who has defied washington 's power for more than four decades and who has reportedly survived hundreds of assassination attempts .
the leader looked well just before his speech asked if the state department wished him a speedy recovery , spokesman richard boucher simply replied : " no " .
" the situation of mr castro is little concern to us but , unfortunately , of enormous importance to the people of cuba , who have suffered very long under his rule , " he said .
one unnamed state department official quoted by afp news agency in washington quipped : " we 've been looking forward to castro 's fall for years but this is n't what we had in mind . "
mr castro , whose fall after a speech at a graduation ceremony in santa clara on wednesday night was caught on camera , issued a public letter reporting the surgery he had undergone .
" given the current circumstances , it was necessary to avoid general anaesthesia to be in conditions to attend numerous important affairs -lsb- of state -rsb- , " he said .
in the 1,183-word letter published on thursday , he blamed his fall on " the strong emotions " of the day .

more than half of drivers , 55 % , had not fitted a car alarm and 52 % of victims admitted they had not changed their habits in any way since being robbed .
and latest official figures suggested that just 45 % of victims reported car break-ins to the police .
of those who did , 83 % did not expect anyone to be charged .
the report , which has been sent to justice minister cathy jamieson , was released days before the clocks go back , which usually sees a rise in attacks on cars .
the company advised drivers to park in well-lit places if possible , to stow valuables away and remove the ignition key , even if they are only going to pay for petrol .

nhs lanarkshire and south lanarkshire council have commissioned a new play to be performed in workplaces .
entitled tunnel , it forms part of lanarkshire 's alcohol and drug action autumn alcohol initiative -lrb- adat -rrb- .
adat 's paul wraight said he was confident the play would make people aware of the dangers of binge-drinking and the human cost involved .
" this play challenges all of us to look at the reality of this history in a meaningful and human way - in the context of the life journey of a young couple , " he said .
" the play does n't preach - but it does have a great deal to say . "
we wanted to create a play which got the point across about alcohol abuse and its human costs martin daraz director the play , which features two actors , was launched at wishaw general hospital on thursday and will tour workplaces in lanarkshire until december .
nhs lanarkshire , quoting uk general household survey statistics , said that every week 61,500 lanarkshire people drink more than twice the daily guideline levels .
" from a public health perspective , the consequences for the health of a significant proportion of the men and women in lanarkshire ought to concern all of us , " an nhs lanarkshire spokesperson said .
" adat is effectively piloting the use of performing arts as a stimulating new medium for engaging the people of lanarkshire with the public health debate , as it relates to alcohol consumption .
' stimulating debate ' " performing arts has a strong history in scotland of penetrating the public consciousness and stimulating debate around the political and social issues of the day .
" the ability of the audience to identify with the characters in the play will encourage them to question the place that alcohol has in their own lives and the consequences for the health of their body , mind and relationships . "
director martin daraz , 27 , from new york , said he was keen to make a play which communicated effectively with people .
adat is urging people to guard against alcohol abuse " the play touches on alcohol , money and relationships .
" we wanted to create a play which got its point across about alcohol abuse and its human costs . "
katie douglas , who wrote the play , said she found it quite easy to flesh out the characters because of the binge-drinking culture which exists in many parts of scotland .
the 23-year-old from kilwinning added : " none of my friends are in it though ! "
peter ballantyne , 23 , from aberdeen , and amanda gilliland , 31 , from glasgow , play the two characters .
the play begins with teenagers drinking in a tunnel and writing graffiti .
they discuss their hopes for the future and a friend 's pregnancy .
' facts and figures ' then the focus turns to their marriage and a heated argument in a pub over money and who should be looking after their son .
the characters then get divorced and the final scene focuses on a funeral where the estranged couple discuss their separate , miserable lives in their 40s .
peter ballantyne said he believed the play was a refreshing change from the usual studies and reports released on alcohol abuse .
" this does n't rely on facts and figures to get its message across .
its strength lies in the characters and the human face of excessive alcohol , " he said .
amanda gilliland said the play should make people stop and think about their alcohol intake and whether they should cut down .
" it 's good to try a different approach to get an important message across , " she added .

third-quarter gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- was 9.1 % , down from 9.6 % in the second and 9.8 % in the first .
curbs on investment spending and bank lending were introduced amid signs that the world 's seventh largest economy was in danger of overheating .
the measures should alleviate the need for interest rate rises , analysts said .
hit the brakes even so , it probably is too early to lift restrictions , officals said .
" we should further enhance and expand the achievements of macro-control to guard against a rebound of those problems , " said zheng jingping , a spokesman for the national statistical bureau .
china has been devouring commodities such as oil with a seemingly unquenchable thirst that has helped push the price of crude to record levels .
even though economists agree that the country 's expansion needs to slow to ensure that it is sustainable , there are concerns that any dip in demand may have negative effects on corporate profits and growth worldwide .
analysts said that china will be heartened by friday 's data , which showed urban fixed-asset investment , a key indicator , slowing .
it rose by 28 % in the third quarter , less than the 30 % increase seen in the previous six months .
separate figures showed that consumer price growth slowed by more than expected in september .
the annual rate of inflation was 5.2 % last month , compared with a forecast of 5.3 % .
" the modest slowdown in fixed-asset investment and the pronounced slowdown in inflation are what the authorities want to see , " said tim condon of ing in singapore .

united polymers , in maerdy , went into administration on thursday , putting 310 jobs at the site under threat .
administrator kroll said 48 staff at the plant had received redundancy notices .
local council leaader russell roberts called it a " bitter blow to the economy of the rhondda fach " .
united polymers , which also employs 65 people in corsham , wiltshire , makes rubber and plastic moulded products for the car industry .
but the administrator added it wanted to sell the business as a going concern .
i believed i was a good worker and yet i still did n't do enough to keep my job united polymers worker nicola evans one worker at maerdy , nicola evans , told bbc radio wales she heard she was losing her job after going to work on thursday .
she added : " i went into work for a normal day and realised there were going to be redundancies , but did n't think it was going to happen to me .
" i was taken upstairs and was told my job had gone .
" i asked ' do i come back tomorrow ? ' and they told me ' no ' .
so that 's it .
" i believed i was a good worker and yet i still did n't do enough to keep my job . "
' world leaders ' regan everson , secretary of the gmb union at the plant , said he hoped assistance would be found for the plant .
i will be looking at every possible means of support for the administrator in identifying a buyer , and support for the employees in finding good , new jobs andrew davies , economic development minister he said : " i have no doubt of the skill of the workforce - they are world leaders in some sections of the polymer moulding and rubber mixing business .
" to find the company has gone into administration has been a great shock .
i do n't think anyone saw it coming .
" hopefully , someone can come forward with a rescue plan .
" hopefully , the welsh assembly government , who have been supportive in the past , can look at ways of assisting the company . "
adrian wolstenholme , of administrator kroll , said united polymers ' two plants had a combined turnover of more than £ 18m but it had been placed in administration due to " ongoing losses " .
" we will advertise the businesses for sale and we intend to continue to trade whilst buyers for the businesses are sought , " he said .
the factory opened on the site of the last pit in the rhondda " we appreciate that this is a worrying time for employees and their families . "
united polymers took over the car components factory from engineering group fenner , which had opened the plant in 1997 .
it was built on the site of two pits at the former maerdy colliery - the last pit to close in the rhondda in 1990 , which left the village an unemployment blackspot .
the factory was built after reclaimation on the site of the mine by the welsh development agency in one of the most economically-deprived parts of wales .
the area has also been hit by recent job losses .
earlier this month , fire extinguisher manufacturer chubb announced it was closing its factory in ferndale with the loss of 154 jobs .
rhondda am leighton andrews said a downturn in the automotive industry had affected the plant .
" the company has been hit by difficult conditions in the automotive sector that have affected its cash flow , " he said .
he said the assembly had given substantial assistance to the company earlier this year .
' financial circumstances ' mr andrews called on the wda , education body elwa , the welsh assembly government and rhondda cynon taf council " to look at future business options for the area " .
economic development minister andrew davies said the assembly government and partners had tried to maintain the firm " over a long period " .
" my officials have already met with the administrators , " he said .
" i will be looking at every possible means of support for the administrator in identifying a buyer , and support for the employees in finding good , new jobs . "
rhondda cynon taf council 's cabinet member for economic and community regeneration robert bevan said they had worked with the assembly government over recent months to develop a rescue package .
" it is very sad that the financial circumstances of the company and other commercial factors have resulted in united polymers being forced into administration , " said mr bevan .
plaid cymru am leanne wood said her party would continue to lobby for a relief road for the rhondda fach .
" it will be terrible for the local economy if these jobs go .
" the factory is on the site of the last pit in the rhondda to close .
it will be difficult to attract new firms because of the chronic infrastructure problems . "

but the 31-year-old londoner has opened himself up to criticism by taking on an iconic character so inextricably linked with another actor .
previous remakes of caine 's movies - sylvester stallone 's version of get carter , or 2003 's update of the italian job - have received frosty receptions on this side of the atlantic .
alfie , however , may prove the exception to the rule - even if it does transplant its cocksure , lady-killing protagonist from swinging sixties london to contemporary manhattan .
amoral the change of location , however , is not the only thing that distinguishes charles shyer 's remake from lewis gilbert 's original .
for one thing , changes in attitudes and sexual mores mean the new alfie elkins is hardly the coarse misogynist of old .
back in 1966 , caine 's amoral hero could get away with calling women " birds " and treating them with arrogant disdain .
law 's alfie , though , is a more deceptive rogue , projecting easy charm and bogus sensitivity while secretly rating every conquest on their " fbb " -lrb- " face , boobs , bum " -rrb- .
sir michael caine was oscar-nominated for alfie and sleuth the women have changed too .
for example , there is no room in the new picture for the mousy , dependent homebody jane asher played in gilbert 's version .
in her place is marisa tomei as a worldly-wise single parent who quickly sees law 's " heat-seeking bachelor " for the feckless cad he is .
another new addition is nikki , a drug-abusing manic depressive played by law 's real-life girlfriend , sienna miller .
one consistent character , however , is the " older woman " with whom alfie contemplates settling down .
first essayed by a brassy shelley winters , the role is now played by a coolly elegant susan sarandon .
caine 's alfie raised eyebrows with his casual promiscuity and adulterous relationship with a married woman -lrb- vivien merchant -rrb- .
adventurous law 's hero , however , is even more sexually adventurous , indulging in three-in-a-bed romps and energetic couplings on the back seats of limousines .
at the end of the first film , alfie recognises the error of his ways and the hedonistic shallowness of his " little life " .
that realisation comes a lot sooner in the remake , with law cutting a far more contemplative and insecure figure .
by far the most significant alteration , though , comes in the treatment of a secondary character who is forced to abort alfie 's child .
in many respects , the 1966 alfie and its 2004 counterpart are virtually identical the illegality of termination required gilbert to introduce a seedy backstreet abortionist , memorably played by denholm elliott .
now , of course , the procedure is commonplace , allowing shyer to downplay its importance in the story .
indeed , while the new alfie is considerably bolder than its inspiration in some areas , in others it is conspicuously more conservative .
conservative in many respects , though , the 1966 alfie and its 2004 counterpart are virtually identical .
caine and law both speak directly to the camera , while in many places the dialogue remains the same - notably alfie 's famous rhetorical question , " what 's it all about ? "
audiences , however , have changed beyond recognition since the first alfie was released , not least in their appetite for retro remakes evoking the devil-may-care sentiments of less troubled times .
law and shyer are no doubt hoping these nostalgic yearnings will conquer any reservations filmgoers may have about giving such a well-loved character a 21st century makeover .
alfie opens in the uk on 22 october .

but the 31-year-old londoner has opened himself up to criticism by taking on an iconic character so inextricably linked with another actor .
previous remakes of caine 's movies - sylvester stallone 's version of get carter , or 2003 's update of the italian job - have received frosty receptions on this side of the atlantic .
alfie , however , may prove the exception to the rule - even if it does transplant its cocksure , lady-killing protagonist from swinging sixties london to contemporary manhattan .
amoral the change of location , however , is not the only thing that distinguishes charles shyer 's remake from lewis gilbert 's original .
for one thing , changes in attitudes and sexual mores mean the new alfie elkins is hardly the coarse misogynist of old .
back in 1966 , caine 's amoral hero could get away with calling women " birds " and treating them with arrogant disdain .
law 's alfie , though , is a more deceptive rogue , projecting easy charm and bogus sensitivity while secretly rating every conquest on their " fbb " -lrb- " face , boobs , bum " -rrb- .
sir michael caine was oscar-nominated for alfie and sleuth the women have changed too .
for example , there is no room in the new picture for the mousy , dependent homebody jane asher played in gilbert 's version .
in her place is marisa tomei as a worldly-wise single parent who quickly sees law 's " heat-seeking bachelor " for the feckless cad he is .
another new addition is nikki , a drug-abusing manic depressive played by law 's real-life girlfriend , sienna miller .
one consistent character , however , is the " older woman " with whom alfie contemplates settling down .
first essayed by a brassy shelley winters , the role is now played by a coolly elegant susan sarandon .
caine 's alfie raised eyebrows with his casual promiscuity and adulterous relationship with a married woman -lrb- vivien merchant -rrb- .
adventurous law 's hero , however , is even more sexually adventurous , indulging in three-in-a-bed romps and energetic couplings on the back seats of limousines .
at the end of the first film , alfie recognises the error of his ways and the hedonistic shallowness of his " little life " .
that realisation comes a lot sooner in the remake , with law cutting a far more contemplative and insecure figure .
by far the most significant alteration , though , comes in the treatment of a secondary character who is forced to abort alfie 's child .
in many respects , the 1966 alfie and its 2004 counterpart are virtually identical the illegality of termination required gilbert to introduce a seedy backstreet abortionist , memorably played by denholm elliott .

indeed , while the new alfie is considerably bolder than its inspiration in some areas , in others it is conspicuously more conservative .
conservative in many respects , though , the 1966 alfie and its 2004 counterpart are virtually identical .
caine and law both speak directly to the camera , while in many places the dialogue remains the same - notably alfie 's famous rhetorical question , " what 's it all about ? "
audiences , however , have changed beyond recognition since the first alfie was released , not least in their appetite for retro remakes evoking the devil-may-care sentiments of less troubled times .
law and shyer are no doubt hoping these nostalgic yearnings will conquer any reservations filmgoers may have about giving such a well-loved character a 21st century makeover .
alfie opens in the uk on 22 october .

officers from the divisional drugs unit made the discovery during surveillance operations in the town .
in one case , they saw the four-year-old daughter of a known dealer carrying a heroin wrap out of their house and dropping it for a user .
sergeant john roberts said : " it 's despicable , but dealers will stoop to any level to avoid detection . "
he believes a tougher approach on street dealing has prompted the use of children as couriers .
their parents , he says , know they are at risk of being stopped and searched .
" obviously , we want to get the zero tolerance message out to the dealers and we ask the public to help us get them off the streets . "

seven times more robots will helping us out with the cleaning , security and entertainment in three years ' time , as their price falls and they get smarter .
it is not quite the humanoid vision of blockbuster film i , robot as many of them will be vacuum bots .
two-thirds of the 607,000 domestic robots in use were bought in 2003 , says the un 's annual world robotics report .
by the end of 2007 , 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes , says the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics .
robot pets : a human 's new best friend ?
as well as the vacuuming , they will take over tasks like mowing the lawn , cleaning pools , and washing windows .
robots like irobi , unveiled this week by korean company yujin robotics , will be able to multiple tasks .
it is a net-based , all-in-one family robot complete with educational functions , home security , diary , entertainment , and message delivery capability .
fun and games robots will also be keeping humans company and entertaining them much more , becoming a part of home life .
by 2007 , it is projected that there will be almost 2.5 million entertainment and " leisure " robots in homes , compared to about 137,000 currently .
sony saw global sales of their high-end robots , the all-dancing , voice-recognising , dog-like aibos , climb this year .
sony recently launched its newest version of the high-end robot toy , aibo about 692,000 of them have found homes since its release in 1999 .
aibo enthusiasts even meet up to play aibo football and hold dance contests .
aside from playing football and jigging in the home , robots are increasingly being used to carry out more hazardous or specialists jobs .
robots involved in more serious tasks , like scientific and medical research , defence and surveillance , as well as mine-clearing , will also enjoy a boom in popularity , says the report .
researchers around the world are developing robots for multiple uses , and many are making them a lot smarter and autonomous by developing ai systems -lrb- artificial intelligence -rrb- .
the survey also confirmed that the number of robots in industry has grown globally , with record orders in 2004 .
robot investment in the uk grew by 48 % in 2003 , but robot use in the uk is still lagging far behind the rest of europe .
would you welcome having a robot in the home to do your chores ?
what you would like a robot to do for you ?
is it right to get robots to do our dirty work ?
here are a selection of your comments .
i would like having a robot to help me to do something , like taking care of my baby in case he fell from bed or something bad to happen to him , or for cleaning house etc .
but that wish must depend on a cheaper price or we ca n't afford it .
chii , taiwan please invent one that does the ironing sean o 'donovan , chesterfield imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i think it would be very useful just to have a robot to lift and carry things around .
imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i would welcome robots in my home to do my chores , as long as they were correctly set up and not too expensive .
if they were extremely expensive then i would not want to use them in case they were damaged !
i ca n't really think of anything a domestic robot could realistically do other than floor-related things -lrb- grass cutting , vacuuming -rrb- or fetching me things .
maybe a security robot would be good , but if it hurt someone trying to get into your house you would probably be locked up for it nowadays !
it 's right to get robots to do our dirty work as they can not feel and are completely emotionless so they can carry out tasks more effectively and efficiently than humans .
adam foxton , dundee , scotland i 'd find some of them more a hindrance .
why would i want some bulky plastic thing taking up floor space , when i can just get out my vacuum for a minute or two a day ?
the only way i 'll be convinced is if a robot can de-ice my car in the morning , i 'd pay good money for one of those !
tony , uk more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety dave hands , uk since the introduction of labour-saving devices there has been a noticeable increase in mental illness , silly ideas , depression , stress and anxiety .
arguably this is due to the amount of time we now have to sit around wondering what to do .
i do n't mean that we should return to the days of endless hard work just getting the washing done / house cleaned .
but there is a limit .
more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety .
one wonders whether we will live to see a " bonfire of the micro chips " , when people burn their computers , robots , mobile phones etc in an attempt to get their privacy and minds back ?
dave hands , birmingham , uk i 'm all for progress and love the thought of having a robot in the house to vacuum , cook , clean etc .
you ca n't stop evolution , we 're surrounded by computers everywhere we go , so having ones that can , in part communicate with us is just the next link on the chain !
olli budworth , hampshire i have to say it seems to scary to be honest .
although i do like the idea of cleaning robots .
lets just hope and pray they do n't take over the world !
i 'm half and half about the whole robot idea .
charles martin , gateshead , tyne & wear i think that we must use the robots for all our dirty works but not as a pet or friend .
to accept them as a friend kills our emotions .
the robots can be strong , useful and fast , but they do n't have a heart .
yucel bozak , turkey people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like keith baker , germany my feelings on the matter of robots in the home are good , i have purchased a sony aibo and they are great fun and harmless .
i think that as long as it does not go to far as a robot baby sitter etc .
people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like .
keith baker , germany have n't we seen enough dodgy movies to learn that , ultimately , robots will take over the planet and enslave humankind ?
this is a bad idea !
jo , peterborough i think it is actually quite scary , i 'm all for techno-advancement ; but it could end up being like the terminator one day when computers rise up to dispel their war-mongering creators .
you only need to look at how hackers are already recruiting networks of thousands of ' bot computers to wage virus war against millions of innocent people .
ryan , poole , uk we are using robots already , to do the washing , drying etc .
the only difference is that , in the future , we will have those that can multi-task and , most importantly , move about and probably have voice recognition capability .
ben , lagos , nigeria a modern robot is nothing but a fancy spanner .
would i let it do my dirty work ?
yes !
jason , uk what do you mean , " is it right to get robots to do our dirty work ? "
that 's like asking , " is it right to use a car to get you from place to place ! ? "
it 's a ridiculous question , robots are machines , tools and nothing more .
i know how it might be nice to think of films like millennium man or i robot or the matrix and give robots an intelligence they simply do not posses at this time -lrb- and it 's very doubtful they ever will -rrb- .
a modern robot is nothing but a fancy spanner .
would i let it do my dirty work ?
yes !
jason , uk i already have several small robots around my house .
we have an i-cybie to entertain the younger kids , a robosapien for the older one and kit built one as an experiment .
i think robots can be invaluable tools for learning but could also be used for dangerous jobs that really help save human lives .
i do n't think we should allow ourselves to become dependant on robots for all things though otherwise we would very quickly find ourselves out of a job !
paul clarke , uk since robots are currently incapable of conscious thought , there is no reason they should not be used for doing our dirty work , as they are tools , but cleverer than conventional ones .
however , were ai to become so advanced that they were sentient , at that point our using them for dirty work would be comparable to slavery .
jon morrison , birmingham i 'll be fine for a while until the robots start to get a bit clever .
then no doubt you 'll have people campaigning for rights for robots .
probably with the slogan " robots are people too " ged , liverpool i have a sony aibo ers-7 .
it 's as much fun as a smelly hairy pet but i can switch fred -lrb- the aibo -rrb- off when he starts annoying me .
no vets bills , no poo and no biting .
i 'm looking forward to using more robots in my home .
giuseppe , basingstoke , uk sean from chesterfield writes that he 'd like an ironing robot .
the good news is : siemens has already invented an ironing robot !
the only disadvantage is its price tag .
håvard , trondheim , norway at best , we have the prospect of malfunctioning robo-butlers crashing over the furniture and spilling our g & ts on the automated stealth hoover t avery , chatham , uk those of us with our eye on the ball know that the promise of a technology-supported , utopian future is a hollow one .
at best , we have the prospect of malfunctioning robo-butlers crashing over the furniture and spilling our g & ts on the automated stealth hoover ; at worse , the terrifying reality that our cybernetic homes will one day turn on us , forcing humanity into a desperate , apocalyptic battle for survival across the nuke-ravaged wastelands of our once-beautiful planet .
anyway , amid all this talk of " domestic intelligent service robots " , where is the one thing we were promised in the 1950s and have been waiting for ever since - the one thing we really want ?
in short : where 's our flying car ?
t avery , chatham , uk hello , films like the terminator are only fiction !
get real .
karen kelsey , coventry the observation about robots rising up is pure silliness ; your ironing robot is hardly likely to decide to make a break for freedom one day because your ironing robot can not " decide " anything , all it can do is follow its programming , just like any other computer today .
the danger here is the development of artificial intelligence , something which is not likely to happen soon if at all in our lifetimes .
mitchell , united kingdom i do not understand how people want to substitute beings with robots .
a dog is a dog , aibo is not a dog .
it is really " cool " in one word , but nothing more than that .
some people have asked robots that clean and push trolleys .
well that can exist now , but people can do that .
i can assure you that there are thousands of people in your cities interested to do those things .
hence , the money gives them incentive to do the job as better as possible .
why not give human beings a change , but we are already occupied with the idea of robots .
d. , prishtina , kosovo robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place roma , middlesex , uk there is no substitute for warm human contact , real emotion , compassion , and understanding .
above all a sincere heart .
let 's move with the times but lets not forget the need for the more basic things in life , love and affection , only a real friend , dog etc can offer these things.robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place .
roma , middlesex , uk i 'm all for robots doing the house work but i think there are much more important things that can be done using the technology that is around today .
think of the possibilities when poor underdeveloped countries could grow and produce areas of crops faster with robots that can do the job of 20 people in half the time .
i think it would be foolish to turn our backs on something that could have the potential to solve a lot of the worlds issues .
i 'm not saying they could be the solution to all our problems , but it could be a good start .

i know how it might be nice to think of films like millennium man or i robot or the matrix and give robots an intelligence they simply do not posses at this time -lrb- and it 's very doubtful they ever will -rrb- .
a modern robot is nothing but a fancy spanner .
would i let it do my dirty work ?
yes !
jason , uk i already have several small robots around my house .
we have an i-cybie to entertain the younger kids , a robosapien for the older one and kit built one as an experiment .
i think robots can be invaluable tools for learning but could also be used for dangerous jobs that really help save human lives .
i do n't think we should allow ourselves to become dependant on robots for all things though otherwise we would very quickly find ourselves out of a job !
paul clarke , uk since robots are currently incapable of conscious thought , there is no reason they should not be used for doing our dirty work , as they are tools , but cleverer than conventional ones .
however , were ai to become so advanced that they were sentient , at that point our using them for dirty work would be comparable to slavery .
jon morrison , birmingham i 'll be fine for a while until the robots start to get a bit clever .
then no doubt you 'll have people campaigning for rights for robots .
probably with the slogan " robots are people too " ged , liverpool i have a sony aibo ers-7 .
it 's as much fun as a smelly hairy pet but i can switch fred -lrb- the aibo -rrb- off when he starts annoying me .
no vets bills , no poo and no biting .
i 'm looking forward to using more robots in my home .

at best , we have the prospect of malfunctioning robo-butlers crashing over the furniture and spilling our g & ts on the automated stealth hoover ; at worse , the terrifying reality that our cybernetic homes will one day turn on us , forcing humanity into a desperate , apocalyptic battle for survival across the nuke-ravaged wastelands of our once-beautiful planet .
anyway , amid all this talk of " domestic intelligent service robots " , where is the one thing we were promised in the 1950s and have been waiting for ever since - the one thing we really want ?
in short : where 's our flying car ?
t avery , chatham , uk hello , films like the terminator are only fiction !
get real .
karen kelsey , coventry the observation about robots rising up is pure silliness ; your ironing robot is hardly likely to decide to make a break for freedom one day because your ironing robot can not " decide " anything , all it can do is follow its programming , just like any other computer today .
the danger here is the development of artificial intelligence , something which is not likely to happen soon if at all in our lifetimes .
mitchell , united kingdom i do not understand how people want to substitute beings with robots .
a dog is a dog , aibo is not a dog .
it is really " cool " in one word , but nothing more than that .
some people have asked robots that clean and push trolleys .
well that can exist now , but people can do that .
i can assure you that there are thousands of people in your cities interested to do those things .
hence , the money gives them incentive to do the job as better as possible .
why not give human beings a change , but we are already occupied with the idea of robots .
d. , prishtina , kosovo robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place roma , middlesex , uk there is no substitute for warm human contact , real emotion , compassion , and understanding .
above all a sincere heart .
let 's move with the times but lets not forget the need for the more basic things in life , love and affection , only a real friend , dog etc can offer these things.robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place .
roma , middlesex , uk i 'm all for robots doing the house work but i think there are much more important things that can be done using the technology that is around today .
think of the possibilities when poor underdeveloped countries could grow and produce areas of crops faster with robots that can do the job of 20 people in half the time .
i think it would be foolish to turn our backs on something that could have the potential to solve a lot of the worlds issues .
i 'm not saying they could be the solution to all our problems , but it could be a good start .

seven times more robots will helping us out with the cleaning , security and entertainment in three years ' time , as their price falls and they get smarter .
it is not quite the humanoid vision of blockbuster film i , robot as many of them will be vacuum bots .
two-thirds of the 607,000 domestic robots in use were bought in 2003 , says the un 's annual world robotics report .
by the end of 2007 , 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes , says the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics .
robot pets : a human 's new best friend ?
as well as the vacuuming , they will take over tasks like mowing the lawn , cleaning pools , and washing windows .
robots like irobi , unveiled this week by korean company yujin robotics , will be able to multiple tasks .
it is a net-based , all-in-one family robot complete with educational functions , home security , diary , entertainment , and message delivery capability .
fun and games robots will also be keeping humans company and entertaining them much more , becoming a part of home life .
by 2007 , it is projected that there will be almost 2.5 million entertainment and " leisure " robots in homes , compared to about 137,000 currently .
sony saw global sales of their high-end robots , the all-dancing , voice-recognising , dog-like aibos , climb this year .
sony recently launched its newest version of the high-end robot toy , aibo about 692,000 of them have found homes since its release in 1999 .
aibo enthusiasts even meet up to play aibo football and hold dance contests .
aside from playing football and jigging in the home , robots are increasingly being used to carry out more hazardous or specialists jobs .
robots involved in more serious tasks , like scientific and medical research , defence and surveillance , as well as mine-clearing , will also enjoy a boom in popularity , says the report .
researchers around the world are developing robots for multiple uses , and many are making them a lot smarter and autonomous by developing ai systems -lrb- artificial intelligence -rrb- .
the survey also confirmed that the number of robots in industry has grown globally , with record orders in 2004 .
robot investment in the uk grew by 48 % in 2003 , but robot use in the uk is still lagging far behind the rest of europe .
would you welcome having a robot in the home to do your chores ?
what you would like a robot to do for you ?
is it right to get robots to do our dirty work ?
here are a selection of your comments .
i would like having a robot to help me to do something , like taking care of my baby in case he fell from bed or something bad to happen to him , or for cleaning house etc .
but that wish must depend on a cheaper price or we ca n't afford it .
chii , taiwan please invent one that does the ironing sean o 'donovan , chesterfield imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i think it would be very useful just to have a robot to lift and carry things around .
imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i would welcome robots in my home to do my chores , as long as they were correctly set up and not too expensive .
if they were extremely expensive then i would not want to use them in case they were damaged !
i ca n't really think of anything a domestic robot could realistically do other than floor-related things -lrb- grass cutting , vacuuming -rrb- or fetching me things .
maybe a security robot would be good , but if it hurt someone trying to get into your house you would probably be locked up for it nowadays !
it 's right to get robots to do our dirty work as they can not feel and are completely emotionless so they can carry out tasks more effectively and efficiently than humans .
adam foxton , dundee , scotland i 'd find some of them more a hindrance .
why would i want some bulky plastic thing taking up floor space , when i can just get out my vacuum for a minute or two a day ?
the only way i 'll be convinced is if a robot can de-ice my car in the morning , i 'd pay good money for one of those !
tony , uk more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety dave hands , uk since the introduction of labour-saving devices there has been a noticeable increase in mental illness , silly ideas , depression , stress and anxiety .
arguably this is due to the amount of time we now have to sit around wondering what to do .
i do n't mean that we should return to the days of endless hard work just getting the washing done / house cleaned .
but there is a limit .
more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety .
one wonders whether we will live to see a " bonfire of the micro chips " , when people burn their computers , robots , mobile phones etc in an attempt to get their privacy and minds back ?
dave hands , birmingham , uk i 'm all for progress and love the thought of having a robot in the house to vacuum , cook , clean etc .
you ca n't stop evolution , we 're surrounded by computers everywhere we go , so having ones that can , in part communicate with us is just the next link on the chain !
olli budworth , hampshire i have to say it seems to scary to be honest .
although i do like the idea of cleaning robots .
lets just hope and pray they do n't take over the world !
i 'm half and half about the whole robot idea .
charles martin , gateshead , tyne & wear i think that we must use the robots for all our dirty works but not as a pet or friend .
to accept them as a friend kills our emotions .
the robots can be strong , useful and fast , but they do n't have a heart .
yucel bozak , turkey people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like keith baker , germany my feelings on the matter of robots in the home are good , i have purchased a sony aibo and they are great fun and harmless .
i think that as long as it does not go to far as a robot baby sitter etc .
people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like .
keith baker , germany have n't we seen enough dodgy movies to learn that , ultimately , robots will take over the planet and enslave humankind ?
this is a bad idea !
jo , peterborough i think it is actually quite scary , i 'm all for techno-advancement ; but it could end up being like the terminator one day when computers rise up to dispel their war-mongering creators .
you only need to look at how hackers are already recruiting networks of thousands of ' bot computers to wage virus war against millions of innocent people .
ryan , poole , uk we are using robots already , to do the washing , drying etc .
the only difference is that , in the future , we will have those that can multi-task and , most importantly , move about and probably have voice recognition capability .

seven times more robots will helping us out with the cleaning , security and entertainment in three years ' time , as their price falls and they get smarter .
it is not quite the humanoid vision of blockbuster film i , robot as many of them will be vacuum bots .
two-thirds of the 607,000 domestic robots in use were bought in 2003 , says the un 's annual world robotics report .
by the end of 2007 , 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes , says the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics .
robot pets : a human 's new best friend ?
as well as the vacuuming , they will take over tasks like mowing the lawn , cleaning pools , and washing windows .
robots like irobi , unveiled this week by korean company yujin robotics , will be able to multiple tasks .
it is a net-based , all-in-one family robot complete with educational functions , home security , diary , entertainment , and message delivery capability .
fun and games robots will also be keeping humans company and entertaining them much more , becoming a part of home life .
by 2007 , it is projected that there will be almost 2.5 million entertainment and " leisure " robots in homes , compared to about 137,000 currently .
sony saw global sales of their high-end robots , the all-dancing , voice-recognising , dog-like aibos , climb this year .
sony recently launched its newest version of the high-end robot toy , aibo about 692,000 of them have found homes since its release in 1999 .
aibo enthusiasts even meet up to play aibo football and hold dance contests .
aside from playing football and jigging in the home , robots are increasingly being used to carry out more hazardous or specialists jobs .
robots involved in more serious tasks , like scientific and medical research , defence and surveillance , as well as mine-clearing , will also enjoy a boom in popularity , says the report .
researchers around the world are developing robots for multiple uses , and many are making them a lot smarter and autonomous by developing ai systems -lrb- artificial intelligence -rrb- .
the survey also confirmed that the number of robots in industry has grown globally , with record orders in 2004 .
robot investment in the uk grew by 48 % in 2003 , but robot use in the uk is still lagging far behind the rest of europe .
would you welcome having a robot in the home to do your chores ?
what you would like a robot to do for you ?
is it right to get robots to do our dirty work ?
here are a selection of your comments .
i would like having a robot to help me to do something , like taking care of my baby in case he fell from bed or something bad to happen to him , or for cleaning house etc .
but that wish must depend on a cheaper price or we ca n't afford it .
chii , taiwan please invent one that does the ironing sean o 'donovan , chesterfield imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i think it would be very useful just to have a robot to lift and carry things around .
imagine a shopping trolley that followed you around the store , or robotic luggage trolleys in airports maybe ?
howard dickins , cardiff i would welcome robots in my home to do my chores , as long as they were correctly set up and not too expensive .
if they were extremely expensive then i would not want to use them in case they were damaged !
i ca n't really think of anything a domestic robot could realistically do other than floor-related things -lrb- grass cutting , vacuuming -rrb- or fetching me things .
maybe a security robot would be good , but if it hurt someone trying to get into your house you would probably be locked up for it nowadays !
it 's right to get robots to do our dirty work as they can not feel and are completely emotionless so they can carry out tasks more effectively and efficiently than humans .
adam foxton , dundee , scotland i 'd find some of them more a hindrance .
why would i want some bulky plastic thing taking up floor space , when i can just get out my vacuum for a minute or two a day ?
the only way i 'll be convinced is if a robot can de-ice my car in the morning , i 'd pay good money for one of those !
tony , uk more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety dave hands , uk since the introduction of labour-saving devices there has been a noticeable increase in mental illness , silly ideas , depression , stress and anxiety .
arguably this is due to the amount of time we now have to sit around wondering what to do .
i do n't mean that we should return to the days of endless hard work just getting the washing done / house cleaned .
but there is a limit .
more machines means more isolation which in turn will lead to more illness , more depression and more anxiety .
one wonders whether we will live to see a " bonfire of the micro chips " , when people burn their computers , robots , mobile phones etc in an attempt to get their privacy and minds back ?
dave hands , birmingham , uk i 'm all for progress and love the thought of having a robot in the house to vacuum , cook , clean etc .
you ca n't stop evolution , we 're surrounded by computers everywhere we go , so having ones that can , in part communicate with us is just the next link on the chain !
olli budworth , hampshire i have to say it seems to scary to be honest .
although i do like the idea of cleaning robots .
lets just hope and pray they do n't take over the world !
i 'm half and half about the whole robot idea .
charles martin , gateshead , tyne & wear i think that we must use the robots for all our dirty works but not as a pet or friend .
to accept them as a friend kills our emotions .
the robots can be strong , useful and fast , but they do n't have a heart .
yucel bozak , turkey people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like keith baker , germany my feelings on the matter of robots in the home are good , i have purchased a sony aibo and they are great fun and harmless .
i think that as long as it does not go to far as a robot baby sitter etc .
people need to try and remember that they are still computers driven by software and prone to crashing , hackers and such like .
keith baker , germany have n't we seen enough dodgy movies to learn that , ultimately , robots will take over the planet and enslave humankind ?
this is a bad idea !
jo , peterborough i think it is actually quite scary , i 'm all for techno-advancement ; but it could end up being like the terminator one day when computers rise up to dispel their war-mongering creators .
you only need to look at how hackers are already recruiting networks of thousands of ' bot computers to wage virus war against millions of innocent people .
ryan , poole , uk we are using robots already , to do the washing , drying etc .
the only difference is that , in the future , we will have those that can multi-task and , most importantly , move about and probably have voice recognition capability .
ben , lagos , nigeria a modern robot is nothing but a fancy spanner .
would i let it do my dirty work ?
yes !
jason , uk what do you mean , " is it right to get robots to do our dirty work ? "
that 's like asking , " is it right to use a car to get you from place to place ! ? "
it 's a ridiculous question , robots are machines , tools and nothing more .
i know how it might be nice to think of films like millennium man or i robot or the matrix and give robots an intelligence they simply do not posses at this time -lrb- and it 's very doubtful they ever will -rrb- .
a modern robot is nothing but a fancy spanner .
would i let it do my dirty work ?
yes !
jason , uk i already have several small robots around my house .
we have an i-cybie to entertain the younger kids , a robosapien for the older one and kit built one as an experiment .
i think robots can be invaluable tools for learning but could also be used for dangerous jobs that really help save human lives .
i do n't think we should allow ourselves to become dependant on robots for all things though otherwise we would very quickly find ourselves out of a job !
paul clarke , uk since robots are currently incapable of conscious thought , there is no reason they should not be used for doing our dirty work , as they are tools , but cleverer than conventional ones .
however , were ai to become so advanced that they were sentient , at that point our using them for dirty work would be comparable to slavery .
jon morrison , birmingham i 'll be fine for a while until the robots start to get a bit clever .
then no doubt you 'll have people campaigning for rights for robots .
probably with the slogan " robots are people too " ged , liverpool i have a sony aibo ers-7 .
it 's as much fun as a smelly hairy pet but i can switch fred -lrb- the aibo -rrb- off when he starts annoying me .
no vets bills , no poo and no biting .
i 'm looking forward to using more robots in my home .
giuseppe , basingstoke , uk sean from chesterfield writes that he 'd like an ironing robot .
the good news is : siemens has already invented an ironing robot !
the only disadvantage is its price tag .
håvard , trondheim , norway at best , we have the prospect of malfunctioning robo-butlers crashing over the furniture and spilling our g & ts on the automated stealth hoover t avery , chatham , uk those of us with our eye on the ball know that the promise of a technology-supported , utopian future is a hollow one .
at best , we have the prospect of malfunctioning robo-butlers crashing over the furniture and spilling our g & ts on the automated stealth hoover ; at worse , the terrifying reality that our cybernetic homes will one day turn on us , forcing humanity into a desperate , apocalyptic battle for survival across the nuke-ravaged wastelands of our once-beautiful planet .
anyway , amid all this talk of " domestic intelligent service robots " , where is the one thing we were promised in the 1950s and have been waiting for ever since - the one thing we really want ?
in short : where 's our flying car ?
t avery , chatham , uk hello , films like the terminator are only fiction !
get real .
karen kelsey , coventry the observation about robots rising up is pure silliness ; your ironing robot is hardly likely to decide to make a break for freedom one day because your ironing robot can not " decide " anything , all it can do is follow its programming , just like any other computer today .
the danger here is the development of artificial intelligence , something which is not likely to happen soon if at all in our lifetimes .
mitchell , united kingdom i do not understand how people want to substitute beings with robots .
a dog is a dog , aibo is not a dog .
it is really " cool " in one word , but nothing more than that .
some people have asked robots that clean and push trolleys .
well that can exist now , but people can do that .
i can assure you that there are thousands of people in your cities interested to do those things .
hence , the money gives them incentive to do the job as better as possible .
why not give human beings a change , but we are already occupied with the idea of robots .
d. , prishtina , kosovo robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place roma , middlesex , uk there is no substitute for warm human contact , real emotion , compassion , and understanding .
above all a sincere heart .
let 's move with the times but lets not forget the need for the more basic things in life , love and affection , only a real friend , dog etc can offer these things.robots are fine in their place but i do n't think the home is that place .
roma , middlesex , uk i 'm all for robots doing the house work but i think there are much more important things that can be done using the technology that is around today .
think of the possibilities when poor underdeveloped countries could grow and produce areas of crops faster with robots that can do the job of 20 people in half the time .
i think it would be foolish to turn our backs on something that could have the potential to solve a lot of the worlds issues .
i 'm not saying they could be the solution to all our problems , but it could be a good start .
