in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2004 german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . the mannheimer morgen wrote that anti-semitism was never just a german but a pan-european phenomenon .
and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 berlin summit pledges to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president katzav , left , liked what schröder had to say .
delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .
29 , 2003 , during celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the turkish republic .
geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .

speculation of a deal has been rife ever since the german company made it known that it was in favor of creating strong european enterprises through mergers .
however , both firms denied they were in talks , despite siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer 's admittance that he had met with french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin to discuss alstom 's plight .
von pierer attempted to further pour cold water on the rumors by adding that his company was not pushing for any particular outcome from the talks with the french premier .
" siemens is not lying in wait .
we are waiting very calmly to see what decisions will be made , " von pierer told a reporters .
the french state is looking for a way to ensure alstom 's long-term future after rescuing the company from immediate collapse last year , industry and official sources told reuters . more briefs 29.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 870,000 vehicles 29.04.2004 -pipe- spd chief says ' no ' to low wage jobs 28.04.2004 -pipe- consumer survey shows german confidence rising 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .

it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .

the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .
" in the end , they had to pay anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.04.2004 pro-western politician wins macedonian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turnout for macedonian presidential elections was just high enough .
three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.04.2004 german soccer humiliated in bucharest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans start to lose count as the romanians run riot .
it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2004 german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . the mannheimer morgen wrote that anti-semitism was never just a german but a pan-european phenomenon .
and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .

the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .

some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .

some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .

according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .

" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .

poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .

according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 berlin summit pledges to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president katzav , left , liked what schröder had to say .
delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .
29 , 2003 , during celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the turkish republic .
geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .
both countries have since dropped their strong opposition to the document . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting turkish-german trade a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .

he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today .

the retired tennis star got above average ratings for the debut of his chat show " becker 1:1 " on the german sports channel dsf .
the first bit of praise though , came from becker 's guest , fc bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld .
" you 're very well prepared , " said hitzfeld when becker surprised him with detailed knowledge of hitzfeld 's childhood .
becker prefers not to be compared with the more established german talkmasters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe global warming is increasing the scope of natural disasters .
in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .

" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .

she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .
" in the end , they had to pay anyway .

participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .

the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict .

if unchecked , the problem could cause rapid wear and tear and even serious damage to the wheel supporting bearing arm .
the company expects that about 1 percent of the vehicles affected by the recall will need repairs , a spokesman said .
the models affected were the vw passat built between 1996 and 1999 , the audi a4 and a8 built between 1994 and 1999 , and the audi a6 built between 1997 and 1999 . more briefs 29.04.2004 -pipe- spd chief says ' no ' to low wage jobs 28.04.2004 -pipe- consumer survey shows german confidence rising 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 26.04.2004 -pipe- retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

laurent fabius , a socialist former french prime minister and currently a member of the french parliament , stated on apri 28 while speaking at the center for european policy studies in brussels that the functioning of the eu will be brought to a stalemate if turkey , a country of almost 68 million inhabitants , is allowed to become a member .
referring to the proposals on qualified majority voting in the draft european constitution - where size of population is a key factor - mr fabius said that turkey could block an eu decision in 70 percent of the cases .
the french socialist said that turkey could only become an eu member in the future if the eu institutions were reformed first .
he characterised the proposals for institutional reform in the draft constitution as " insufficient . "

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .

exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .

minister for migration and asylum policy barbro holmberg warned in the debate that the swedish social security system would be at risk of exploitation and salaries could slump .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .
" in the end , they had to pay anyway . " negotiations are expected to continue until saturday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de day tripping from munich to ski paradise what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .

sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .

von pierer attempted to further pour cold water on the rumors by adding that his company was not pushing for any particular outcome from the talks with the french premier .
" siemens is not lying in wait .
we are waiting very calmly to see what decisions will be made , " von pierer told a reporters .
the french state is looking for a way to ensure alstom 's long-term future after rescuing the company from immediate collapse last year , industry and official sources told reuters . more briefs 29.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 870,000 vehicles 29.04.2004 -pipe- spd chief says ' no ' to low wage jobs 28.04.2004 -pipe- consumer survey shows german confidence rising 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .
some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .
latvian shipping company - latvia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian shipping company -lrb- lsc -rrb- is the largest shipping company in latvia and provides a range of sea transportation services .
it has the fifth largest tanker fleet in the world and the largest in northern europe .
the company began operations in 1991 after it took over 87 vessels from the soviet commercial fleet which were registered in latvian ports .
lsc has some 1,800 employees around the globe and rang up nearly $ 194 million in shipping turnover last year . since the company 's fleet is aging , its strategic plan for 2003-2010 provides for a € 294 million -lrb- $ 350 million -rrb- investment in a fleet renewal program .
to fulfill a commitment to the international monetary fund , the government had to sell its majority stake in the company .
after several failed attempts , 51 percent of the company was successfully sold in 2002 .
latvian investors purchased some 61 percent of the shares , while international investors bought the remaining 39 percent .
gorenje group - slovenia household appliance maker gorenje is slovenia 's largest manufacturing company and also slovenia 's largest net exporter .
it manufactures about 2 million large household appliances annually , of which 93 percent are exported to demanding foreign markets .
it controls 70 percent of the slovenian market and has been branching out into europe .
the gorenje group , which includes the parent company and subsidiaries at home and abroad , recorded net sales revenues of € 826 million -lrb- $ 985 million -rrb- in 2003 the company was founded in 1950 , when the production of small stoves began in the small town of gorenje .

ten years later , its first subsidiary was set up in munich .
it is now doing business in more than 60 countries .
franjo bobinac , gorenje 's chairman who took over in 2003 , said he aims to place the company among the top five leading companies in europe by 2006 and reaching € 1 billion in sales in the next three to four years .
zalakerámia rt. - hungary zalakerámia manufactures , distributes and sells glazed ceramic floor , wall and stove tiles and bathroom equipment .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .

according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .

one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .
29 , 2003 , during celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the turkish republic .
geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .

geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .
both countries have since dropped their strong opposition to the document . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting turkish-german trade a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders .
-lrb- apr.1 , 2004 -rrb- eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .

ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .

it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 berlin summit pledges to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president katzav , left , liked what schröder had to say .
delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts believe global warming is increasing the scope of natural disasters .
in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 berlin summit pledges to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president katzav , left , liked what schröder had to say .
delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .

german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .
" in the end , they had to pay anyway . " negotiations are expected to continue until saturday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de day tripping from munich to ski paradise what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .

but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .

hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .
stop the poison from spreading , " wiesel said . in a speech opening the conference , german president johannes rau said criticism of israeli actions against the palestinians could not be used as a shield for anti-jewish sentiment .
" everyone knows that massive anti-semitism is behind some of the criticism of the israeli government 's policies in the last decades , " he said . negative attitudes toward israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of the conference , the u.s. anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- published the results of its latest poll on anti-semitism in europe .
the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .

in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .
some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .

geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .

he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .
29 , 2003 , during celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the turkish republic .
geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .

"
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .

" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .

full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .

it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .

stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .

ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .
" back then they threatened us with a lawyer , but that did n't help them , " she said .
" in the end , they had to pay anyway . " negotiations are expected to continue until saturday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de day tripping from munich to ski paradise what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .

in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !
stop a disease that has lasted so long .

the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 . " these findings reflect a bias against israel in europe among government and media , " foxman said .
he called for " responsible and balanced european positions that engender trust on both sides of the -lrb- israeli-palestinian -rrb- conflict .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .

" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2004 german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . the mannheimer morgen wrote that anti-semitism was never just a german but a pan-european phenomenon .
and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .

but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .

"
in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .
some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .
latvian shipping company - latvia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian shipping company -lrb- lsc -rrb- is the largest shipping company in latvia and provides a range of sea transportation services .
it has the fifth largest tanker fleet in the world and the largest in northern europe .
the company began operations in 1991 after it took over 87 vessels from the soviet commercial fleet which were registered in latvian ports .
lsc has some 1,800 employees around the globe and rang up nearly $ 194 million in shipping turnover last year . since the company 's fleet is aging , its strategic plan for 2003-2010 provides for a € 294 million -lrb- $ 350 million -rrb- investment in a fleet renewal program .
to fulfill a commitment to the international monetary fund , the government had to sell its majority stake in the company .
after several failed attempts , 51 percent of the company was successfully sold in 2002 .
latvian investors purchased some 61 percent of the shares , while international investors bought the remaining 39 percent .
gorenje group - slovenia household appliance maker gorenje is slovenia 's largest manufacturing company and also slovenia 's largest net exporter .
it manufactures about 2 million large household appliances annually , of which 93 percent are exported to demanding foreign markets .
it controls 70 percent of the slovenian market and has been branching out into europe .
the gorenje group , which includes the parent company and subsidiaries at home and abroad , recorded net sales revenues of € 826 million -lrb- $ 985 million -rrb- in 2003 the company was founded in 1950 , when the production of small stoves began in the small town of gorenje .
its first export order came in 1961 from germany .
ten years later , its first subsidiary was set up in munich .
it is now doing business in more than 60 countries .
franjo bobinac , gorenje 's chairman who took over in 2003 , said he aims to place the company among the top five leading companies in europe by 2006 and reaching € 1 billion in sales in the next three to four years .
zalakerámia rt. - hungary zalakerámia manufactures , distributes and sells glazed ceramic floor , wall and stove tiles and bathroom equipment .
it also runs a clay and limestone mine .
the company was founded in 1951 , when it primarily made stove tiles .
but with the decreasing demand for tiled stoves it shifted its focus on floor and wall tiles .
in 1991 , the zalakerámia incorporated company was formed .
it is the only company representing the hungarian building industry whose stocks are traded on the budapest stock exchange .
it has two plants in hungary and two foreign subsidiaries : cesarom in romania and inker in croatia .
the group produces 9 million square meters of tiles annually and has nearly 3,000 employees worldwide .
sales in 2003 were € 76 million . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern european economies revving their motors the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .

according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .

300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .

geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .

" stop !

the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2004 berlin summit pledges to combat anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president katzav , left , liked what schröder had to say .
delegates at an anti-semitism conference in berlin unanimously denounced " new forms and expressions " of hatred against jews and agreed that the middle east conflict could never justify attacks on jews . in a final declaration ending the two-day conference , a 55-nation group of european , north american , and central asian countries unanimously condemned " all attacks motivated by anti-semitism or by any other forms or religious or racial hatred or intolerance , including attacks against synagogues and other religious places , sites and shrines . "
the conference , sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , declared " unambiguously that international developments or political issues , including those in israel or elsewhere in the middle east , never justify anti-semitism . " but that was as close as the delegates came to meeting demands by some jewish non-governmental organizations to equate criticism of the israeli government with anti-semitism . transforming goals into reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer giving a statement at the osce conference .
bulgarian foreign minister and current osce chairman-in-office solomon passy spoke of a " historic conference " that set important goals .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- appealed to all present to work hard on turning those goals into reality .
the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the goals include a commitment to teach children about combating anti-semitism , and to promote remembrance of the holocaust , in which six million jews died at the hands of the nazis .
governments also pledged to collect and submit reliable information about anti-semitic and other hate crimes . the location of the conference in berlin , where the nazis planned the extermination of europe 's jews , gave rise to several impassioned speeches , both from holocaust survivors and german politicians . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz , said it was symbolic that a conference aimed at ending anti-semitism was being held in berlin .
but he also spoke of his alarm that anti-semitism continues to thrive across the continent . a recent eu report said anti-semitic incidents increased in five eu nations in 2002-2003 .
the sharpest rise was in france , where the escalation of the middle east conflict is seen as fuelling an upsurge of anti-jewish attacks by extremist muslim groups . germans have " special responsibility " german chancellor gerhard schröder said that because the holocaust had been planned in germany , germans have a special responsibility to combat anti-semitism .
he also called for an " open dialogue that would create ties between people of different cultures and religions . " in that context , schröder said that he hopes for a peaceful and just solution to the middle east crisis .
germany , he said , would continue to be one of the parties mediating in the conflict .
the chancellor added that while criticism of the israeli government should not automatically be equated with anti-semitism , there has to be a clear boundary between having a rational argument about israeli politics , and unacceptable hatred against israel and jewish people . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . -lrb- apr.29 , 2004 -rrb- anti-semitism on the rise in europe a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .

in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .
the country 's environmental minister traveled to the u.s. this week to push needed emissions cuts and alternative energies . the renewables 2000 conference , announced by german chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 at the u.n. environment summit in johannesburg , is intended to demonstrate that renewable energies - like wind and solar power - have developed into fast growing industries that are not only environmentally friendly , but also economically viable solutions .
but renewable energies have played a marginal role in the u.s. market , and during a number of stops on his transatlantic trip this week , jürgen trittin has sought to draw attention to the upside potential of green energy .
trittin also urged the united states to shift its environmental policy by adopting the kyoto protocol .
among the projects trittin has promoted on his trip is a major solar power plant in california that 's being used for research .
the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force .

the german government has subsidized the project to the tune of € 6 million -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- , and the plan is to build a second version of the plant in grenada , spain , making it the first commercial solar power plant of that scale .
a growing business for some time now , renewable energies have no longer been a niche business - they 're used by the mainstream , they 're creating jobs , and they 're a growth industry .
in washington , trittin pointed out that in germany , 20 percent of all energy is expected to come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020 - a goal the united states is very far from meeting .
per capita energy consumption in the u.s. is double that of europe , and most energy there comes from fossil fuels , coal and nuclear power .
even so , the u.s. government has decided to send its own delegation to the renewable energies conference in bonn next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin during a visit to the eminent brookings institution , trittin presented a speech on the global dimensions of environmental policy , at times pointedly criticizing washington for its own environmental record . he underscored the connection between high levels of carbon dioxide gases in industrial nations and global warming .
each year , the u.s. produces 6.6 billion tons of these green house gases , considerably more than europe 's 4.1 billion tons despite having a similar population .
nor has the u.s. signed on to the kyoto protocol , which makes emissions reductions mandatory .
instead , it has overseen a 13 percent increase in emissions of carbon dioxide gases between 1990 and 2000 .
those gases , trittin said , all contribute to global climate catastrophes including hurricanes , floods and droughts .
" i have to underline that the u.s. also must play its part against global warming , " trittin said .
" it could use the kyoto protocol as the basis for action .
under this , the u.s. has to reduce its emissions by 7 percent compared to 1990 .
we must acknowledge that the country rejects kyoto .
the climate framework convention should nonetheless be respected under this .
the u.s. must stabilize its emissions at the 1990 levels , and the u.s. voluntarily accepted this commitment . "
trittin : we want to save the u.s. if the u.s. does not take action to reduce its emissions , trittin warned , parts of the east coast and nature reserves like the everglades in florida could be covered with water in several decades due to the melting of glaciers , which threaten to the sea level worldwide .
" we , from the other side , want to save these areas of the u.s. , " trittin said .
" we love the everglades , for example .
and this is the reason why we think the kyoto protocol must enter into force . "
trittin read out a laundry list of celluloid nightmares of global warming , from kevin costner 's " waterworld " to roland emmerich 's latest movie , which depicts the earth falling into an overnight ice age as a result of global warming .
" we have a challenge , " he said .
" the challenge is that the reality of ' the day after tomorrow ' should not become reality , the picture should not become reality .
therefore , the next 15 years are key for preventing polar ice caps from melting .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .

" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .

the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .

three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.04.2004 pro-western politician wins macedonian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turnout for macedonian presidential elections was just high enough .
three months after the death of macedonia 's president in a plane crash , prime minister branko crvenkovski won the run-off elections to become the next president .
his challenger alleges fraud . center-left prime minister branko crvenkovski triumphed over sasko kedev of the nationalist internal macedonian revolutionary party -lrb- vmro -rrb- in presidential elections wednesday .
but with allegations of fraud , lingering ethnic tensions and high unemployment , the new president faces many challenges .
with a turnout of 53 percent - more than the 50 percent required to make the election valid - crvenkovski won 62 percent of the vote .
his challenger , kedev , won just 37 percent .
crvenkovski hailed the election as a key step forward in macedonia 's journey towards democracy since winning independence from yugoslavia 13 years ago .
" macedonia has passed another test in democracy today , " he told his supporters .
" there are no winners or losers in macedonia today .
defeated are those who have called for a boycott of the vote . "
fraud allegations but his challenger kedev does not believe the elections were a shining example of democracy in action and has challenged the results .
" we will never recognize the self-proclaimed president , " said kedev , who says his party will provide solid evidence of wrongdoing , including stuffing of the ballot boxes .
a spokeswomen for crvenkovski , however , denied the allegations .
" this was a fair and democratic election , " said radmila sekerinska .
macedonia 's state election commission has - as yet - not commented on the controversy .
the run-off elections followed the first round of elections two weeks ago , which narrowed the field of contenders from four candidates to two .
the two ethnic albanian candidates - albanians comprise a quarter of the country 's population - were eliminated during the first round .
challenges ahead in addition to the controversy surrounding the election , the newly-elected president will face many challenges , including unemployment estimated by some experts to be as high as 40 percent and shepherding his country towards eventual eu membership .
his greatest challenge by far will be quelling ethnic tensions between the majority macedonians and ethnic albanians , which nearly brought the country to the brink of civil war three years ago and continue to bubble under the surface .
in 2001 , the now president boris trajkovski who was killed in a plane crash three months ago , presided over a peace deal .
however , fears persist that troubles in neighboring kosovo - the u.n.-administered province of primarily ethnic albanians who are demanding independence from serbia - could spill over into macedonia and re-ignite a conflict .
last month , fighting erupted once again in kosovo .
as he takes over the post from the highly-regarded trajkovski , crvenkovski will concentrate on making ethnic tensions a thing of the past . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia election heads for run-off macedonians will have to wait to see who will be the country 's next president after the first round trimmed the four front runners down to two candidates , who will face a runoff contest in two weeks .
-lrb- april 15 , 2004 -rrb- voting for unity in macedonia a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities .

it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .
ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

ransom negotiations have been unsuccessful so far . erecting a maypole has been a bavarian tradition for centuries and the operators of the zugspitze 's gondola and rack railway system proudly refer to their specimen as " the world 's highest maypole " : painted in bavaria 's national colors of white and blue , the 20 meter -lrb- 65.6 feet -rrb- pole usually stands at an altitude of 2,600 meters -lrb- 8,520 feet -rrb- and weighs almost a ton . that did n't keep a quartet of maypole-nappers from figuring out a way to get the colossus back down the mountain : they enlisted a team from franco-german public broadcaster arte , rented a helicopter and dug up the pole from its secret hiding place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of strong bavarian men in lederhosen are needed to erect a maypole .
stealing a neighboring village 's maypole is also an old bavarian custom and the thieves usually demand a hearty snack and barrel of beer in exchange for the pole . however , news reports diverge as far as the zugspitze bandits are concerned .
" we 're asking for four season tickets and four meals plus beer , " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung quoted a spokeswoman for the group as saying .
zugspitze officials on the other hand told german news agency dpa that they 'd received a ransom demand of 10 season tickets and free meals throughout the winter . the rightful maypole owners have apparently rejected the deal , but the pole-lifters are n't planning on giving up that quickly .
" the abduction presented a considerable risk to our personal health , " the group 's spokeswoman said .
she added that her team was used to tough ransom negotiations with the folks at zugspitze since they had already stolen the pole eight years ago .

squelching rumors of a change in company leadership , the supervisory board of german automaker daimlerchrysler has backed ceo jürgen schrempp at a meeting in new york . in a surprise announcement , daimlerchrysler officials also said that wolfgang bernhard would not succeed jürgen hubbert as the head of the mercedes car group on may 1 .
hubbert will remain in that position until further notice . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper had reported earlier that schrempp tendered his resignation when the company 's supervisory board turned down his plan to support daimlerchrysler 's troubled japanese partner mitsubishi motor co. earlier this month . the supervisory board extended schrempp 's contract by three years to 2008 this month .
on thursday , board members said schrempp had their full support , according to company officials . board of management members eckhard cordes , responsible for asia , and rüdiger grube , who is in charge of strategy , reportedly both supported schrempp and also offered to quit . " schrempp 's vision of a global carmaker has failed , and we would n't be unhappy to see him go , " michael schneider , a fund manager at deka in frankfurt , which holds 13 million daimlerchrysler shares in its portfolio , told bloomberg news . the 59-year-old schrempp has been the main driver of stuttgart-based daimler 's global ambitions and was the architect of its merger-cum-takeover of u.s. auto company chrysler in 1998 .
but the american car market has been caught in a vicious price war and daimlerchrysler 's market value has been cut by half over the past six years .
daimler spent $ 36 billion to buy chrysler and $ 2.2 billion for a 37 percent stake in mitsubishi . resignation to be discussed ? a daimlerchrysler spokesman told the reuters news agency that reports about schrempp 's resignation were " nonsense , " but a company source said on wednesday " one could assume " his offer to quit would be a topic at a board meeting in new york on thursday . the board 's consultations come after the carmaker presented its earnings for the first quarter . the company said in a statement that profit fell by one-third after it took a writedown for a german truck-toll joint venture .
net income fell to € 393 million -lrb- $ 465 million -rrb- from € 588 million in the same period last year .
sales fell 3.9 percent to € 32.4 billion from € 33.7 billion . investors have cheered the decision to end support for mitsubishi , but it leaves daimlerchrysler 's asia strategy in tatters .
exacerbating the situation , the south korean carmaker hyundai motors is also planning to drop all cooperation projects with daimlerchrysler . according to media reports , hyundai chief park hwang-ho is irked at the chinese expansion plans of mercedes-benz , a subsidiary of daimlerchrysler .
the move would affect a major planned alliance between daimlerchrysler and hyundai motors to jointly build heavy trucks and the yearly delivery of 50,000 truck engines to hyundai . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hyundai to sever ties with german carmaker daimlerchrysler 's woes in the asian market deepened with south korean partner hyundai motors planning to scrap a joint truck venture .

speculation of a deal has been rife ever since the german company made it known that it was in favor of creating strong european enterprises through mergers .
however , both firms denied they were in talks , despite siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer 's admittance that he had met with french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin to discuss alstom 's plight .
von pierer attempted to further pour cold water on the rumors by adding that his company was not pushing for any particular outcome from the talks with the french premier .
" siemens is not lying in wait .
we are waiting very calmly to see what decisions will be made , " von pierer told a reporters .
the french state is looking for a way to ensure alstom 's long-term future after rescuing the company from immediate collapse last year , industry and official sources told reuters . more briefs 29.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 870,000 vehicles 29.04.2004 -pipe- spd chief says ' no ' to low wage jobs 28.04.2004 -pipe- consumer survey shows german confidence rising 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

french president jacques chirac on thursday said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future .
he also said he had not yet decided whether to put the eu 's constitution to a referendum . " turkey 's entry into the union is certainly not desirable in the short term , " chirac said at his first major press conference in paris in six years .
" my conviction is that it is in the long term . " although the eu is set to expand from 15 to 25 members on may 1 , the bloc 's leaders are n't scheduled to decide until december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid .
only with that endorsement could the 70 million-strong muslim country start full negotiations over membership in 2005 . chirac said he believed turkey 's destiny lies with europe , but the country had not yet met the conditions for entry to the eu , mentioning concerns over respect for human rights and judicial reform .
" turkey has made considerable efforts , " he said , according to the associated press .
but he added " there is still a way to go . " chirac 's comments could make turkey 's goal of becoming part of europe 's most-exclusive club more difficult , but the government in ankara reacted calmly .
" membership is a different matter -lrb- to starting negotiations -rrb- , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
" once we get a date the process could well take a long time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish girls , holding a national flag , march in downtown istanbul , turkey , wednesday oct .
29 , 2003 , during celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the turkish republic .
geographically straddling europe and asia , turkey has carried out sweeping reforms in the last two years as it tries to meet eu standards .
it abolished the death penalty in all but a few cases and has granted greater rights to the country 's long-oppressed kurdish minority . support for eu constitution chirac also devoted considerable time at the press conference to other european matters .
he said negotiations on the eu 's proposed constitution needed to continue apace : " this agreement is necessary and possible today . " he added france had not yet decided whether to hold a referendum on the constitution , saying the country could also let a joint session of the national assembly and the senate approve the document .
" it is too early to decide on one or the other option , " chirac said . several eu countries , including britain , have opted to let their people decide the fate of the constitution in what could be difficult to win referendums .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who has so far resisted pressure for a referendum , said this week the eu had to find a way to move forward with the constitutional treaty even if euro-sceptic nations like britain failed to pass it . " the truth is we have to find a mechanism for the constitution to enter into force even if the ratification process in one or the other country is not yet completed , " schröder said in a recent interview with focus magazine . eu foreign ministers agreed monday to resume negotiations for europe 's first-ever constitution .
the talks are to be finalized at a june 17-18 eu summit , after which the constitution faces ratification in all eu states .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power .
both countries have since dropped their strong opposition to the document . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting turkish-german trade a new turkish-german chamber of commerce opened in cologne on tuesday : at stake are billions of euros in investments , thousands of jobs , and - not least - the alignment of turkey and the eu .

speculation of a deal has been rife ever since the german company made it known that it was in favor of creating strong european enterprises through mergers .
however , both firms denied they were in talks , despite siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer 's admittance that he had met with french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin to discuss alstom 's plight .
von pierer attempted to further pour cold water on the rumors by adding that his company was not pushing for any particular outcome from the talks with the french premier .
" siemens is not lying in wait .
we are waiting very calmly to see what decisions will be made , " von pierer told a reporters .
the french state is looking for a way to ensure alstom 's long-term future after rescuing the company from immediate collapse last year , industry and official sources told reuters . more briefs 29.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 870,000 vehicles 29.04.2004 -pipe- spd chief says ' no ' to low wage jobs 28.04.2004 -pipe- consumer survey shows german confidence rising 28.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank accepts weber nomination 28.04.2004 -pipe- sanofi aventis deal gets eu thumbs up 28.04.2004 -pipe- schröder says no special zone needed in east 27.04.2004 -pipe- easyjet takes off in germany 26.04.2004 -pipe- business index jumps unexpectedly 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .
" here you have a region where regulations are kept to a minimum and where unions do not really have much say , " said hana machkova , a professor at prague 's school of economics .
the baltic state of estonia chose to adopt the recommendations of american liberal economists by completely abolishing its customs duties and agricultural subsidies and instituting a flat tax .
poland and slovakia have simplified their tax systems to the extreme , slapping a 19 percent rate on sales , income and business taxes .
hungary set its tax rate at 16 percent .
in the current eu member states , the eu-15 , the average rate is 31 to 32 percent , according to a recent study by the auditing group kpmg .
the low tax rates and still relatively cheap labor have proven to be a siren song for companies around the globe , but especially western europe , who are moving production facilities out of countries with higher wage costs to this eastern economic shangri-la .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production at a siemens plant in poland .
in germany , engineering giant siemens could shift up to 10,000 jobs to eastern europe in the coming years .
it has announced it will move 2,000 telephone production jobs to hungary where labor costs are lower .
volkswagen already produces 13 percent of its vehicles in central and eastern europe and air carrier lufthansa will move most of its accounting and purchasing operations to poland .
the bandwagon heading in the dawn 's direction looks like it will soon be very full .
but the roads carrying foreign investment east have already been well trod .
according to merrill lynch , eight former communist new entrants attracted $ 126 billion -lrb- € 107 billion -rrb- in investment between 1993 and 2002 , almost six times more per capita than china .
rosy picture , but challenges lie ahead the news is mostly good for eastern europe 's economic aspects , but that does not mean there are n't serious problems the region will have to tackle .
one of the major ones is joblessness .
fifteen years after communism , the official unemployment rate in eastern europe is still high , averaging 14.3 percent in the accession countries and as high as 19.2 percent in poland .
average incomes are still under half the average of those in the eu-15 .
only slovenia comes close to the income levels of the union 's poorest member , greece .
high fiscal deficits are still at risky levels in the accession countries and corruption , while less of a problem than it was a few years ago , is still a cause for concern among investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows on a grass field below the high tatras mountain , slovakia .
many countries also face troubling infrastructure problems , particularly in rural areas .
it 's in the rural areas where the region will have to focus its energies if it does not want bigger problems later on .
many of the new eu states suffer from wide gaps between successful urban elites and poorer people in rural areas , who are often old , poorly educated and unemployed . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown giants : companies to watch in eastern europe in the post-communist run-up to membership in the eu , eastern european countries have learned the ropes of capitalism .

the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention . six top german economics institutes recently published their forecasts for economic growth in the twelve-country eurozone ; the numbers were n't good .
they predicted the countries that adopted the common european currency - western europe and greece - would only grow by some 1.5 percent in 2004 .
it 's the kind of sclerotic growth that the new upstart eu countries further east can only shake their heads at in sad wonder .
after years of communism , where profit was taboo , and the freefalls of the early 1990s , when the region 's new capitalism shook out the dust from the planned economy past , eastern europe 's growth has reached levels that are turning their western neighbors green with envy .
in fact , over the past few years , economic growth in countries in central and eastern europe has outpaced global economies on the whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland : testing the west and getting good marks poland 's economy has taken off , growing by 3.7 percent in 2003 , compared to 1.4 percent a year earlier .
hungary 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by 2.9 percent in 2003 - a poor showing for this central european state - but is expected to expand by 3.5 percent this year .
the slovenian government has forecast 3.6 percent gdp growth in 2004 and 3.7 percent growth in 2005 .
" new -lrb- eu -rrb- members have much stronger growth , and while there is certainly a catch-up effect involved , it is also because we enacted structural reforms , " slovak finance minister ivan miklos recently told the wire service agence france presse .
business-friendly reforms those reforms include slashing corporate tax rates , deregulating labor markets and largely privatizing their economies .
while some western eu nations , such as germany , try to push through similar reforms to jump start their ailing economies , they have faced massive protests from unions , interest groups and citizens who are angry about cuts in social welfare programs and the easing of labor market rules .
in eastern europe , it 's not a problem .

some companies are now thriving on a global scale .
here 's a look at a few of them . while much is written about multinationals moving to eastern europe , less is known about home-grown companies that have made an international profile for themselves .
a number of them have been able to weather the storm that blew in with the transition to a market economy and have become important global players .
the following are thumbnail profiles of a few of them , central and eastern europe 's own economic success stories , who are poised to enjoy even stronger growth after any remaining barriers to eu markets fall on may 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2004 german press review : the stigma of anti-semitism germany ’ s editorialists on thursday focused attention on the two-day anti-semitism conference that has brought delegates from throughout europe to berlin . the mannheimer morgen wrote that anti-semitism was never just a german but a pan-european phenomenon .
and in contrast to earlier years , today it ’ s not so much right-wing radical activities that give rise to concern but rather a new form of underlying but open antipathy towards jewry in the guise of criticism of israel ’ s middle east policy . the fränkischer tag in bamberg , bavaria , also picked up on that point .
it said criticism of israel ’ s policy towards the palestinians , which some people call state terrorism , is often justified and , of course , not everyone who voices it is an anti-semite .
but there are movements - also in germany - the paper wrote , that exploit their rejection of israel ’ s actions to cultivate or even warm up their old prejudices . according to the neue presse , since the state of israel was established , jews are no longer merely victims .
the hanover daily pointed out that israel is the strongest power in the middle east , and it uses that power sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely to protect the lives of its citizens .
but , the paper concluded , all its power has so far not sufficed to find peace . the düsseldorf-based westdeutsche zeitung wrote that it is out of the question to say that anti-semitism has again become acceptable in our society .
on the contrary , it said , being accused of anti-semitism is a serious stigma that those involved - like the german cdu politician martin hohmann recently - want to shake off as quickly as possible to avoid long-term damage .
people who doubt that this mechanism still works , the paper concluded , may be pursuing interests that go straight to the heart of the middle east conflict . other papers commented on the situation in iraq .
eastern germany ’ s märkische oderzeitung said the usa is now paying the price for not having a plan either for iraq or the middle east .
by taking such tough action against the iraqi rebels , the daily continued , the american military will only trigger more hatred towards the occupiers and in the process minimize the chances of an orderly handover of power .
as a final trump , so to speak , some time in the second half of the year nato forces are to be deployed in iraq .
perhaps , the entire region will then be burning , the paper summarized , and there will be no firemen available to put out the flames in other parts of the world . the dresdner neueste nachrichten referred to the report delivered to the united nations on tuesday by the world body ’ s special envoy in iraq , lakhdar brahimi .
he said it was possible to choose a caretaker government in may , well ahead of the u.s.-set june 30 deadline for handing over power to the iraqis , despite what he called the " extremely worrying " security situation .
the paper said when the need is greatest and the situation appears to be absolutely hopeless , visions are necessary , and that is what brahimi has come up with .
however , whether or not his dream of an early sovereign caretaker government and a peaceful future for the country becomes reality will depend on whether the balance of power in iraq will really change as a result of the handover of power .
many signals coming out of washington , the daily feared , seem to indicate that the transfer of power in iraq is just going to be a cosmetic operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin conference urges action on anti-semitism delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism .

speculation of a deal has been rife ever since the german company made it known that it was in favor of creating strong european enterprises through mergers .
however , both firms denied they were in talks , despite siemens chief executive heinrich von pierer 's admittance that he had met with french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin to discuss alstom 's plight .
von pierer attempted to further pour cold water on the rumors by adding that his company was not pushing for any particular outcome from the talks with the french premier .
" siemens is not lying in wait .
we are waiting very calmly to see what decisions will be made , " von pierer told a reporters .

delegates to an anti-semitism conference in berlin on wednesday urged the international community to step up efforts to fight rising anti-semitism . more than 500 delegates representing 55 countries are taking part in the two-day conference , which is sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
participants including u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav are seeking to adopt a declaration and action plan to fight xenophobia and racism against jews . " we all share the responsibility to fight anti-semitism in our countries , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said .
" that is the most important message of this conference . " the meeting follows a similar conference in vienna last june and comes as jewish groups have complained that european governments have failed to respond to a revival in anti-semitism in recent years which has coincided with escalating violence in the middle east . elie wiesel , nobel laureate and survivor of the nazi death camp auschwitz , said he it was symbolic for the conference to be held in berlin , where the destruction of europe 's jews had been planned .
but he also said he was alarmed at the continuing anti-semitism on the continent .
" stop !

the 10-nation survey found that while anti-jewish sentiment has decreased across the continent , negative attitudes toward israel are on the rise in most western european countries . the adl singled out france as a nation that 's had particular success in addressing the problem of anti-semitism .
the adl 's national director , abraham foxman , praised french president jacques chirac for speaking out against anti-semitic attacks in france and for launching a plan that includes extra security for jewish sites and tough new penalties for those found guilty of anti-jewish acts . " it is now france that is leading the way in showing how a country can reverse itself , " said foxman .
the survey found that 25 percent of french people held anti-semitic views , down from 35 percent in 2002 . only two european nations - britain and the netherlands - recorded increases in anti-semitism , according to the survey , which was based on telephone polls of 500 people in each country .
in both cases , the increases are within the poll 's margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . on the whole , the survey found that attitudes towards israel have worsened in all 10 countries . israel 's " favorability " rating dropped to 23 percent from 28 percent in 2002 .

the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria . when european nuclear experts visited the ignalina power station in lithuania in 1992 , the state of the plant 's two reactors was enough to shock the experienced team into declaring that if large scale modernization did not take place , then they would recommend that the power station should be shut down .
the control rooms of the reactors , which were of the same type as that at the ill-fated chernobyl plant , had no special protection and were situated in the turbine buildings , the most accident-prone part of any nuclear power station .
a fire or an explosion would render the control room inaccessible , the team reported , making any attempt to shut down the reactor impossible .
equally troubling , investigators found that fire doors were made of wood and that all emergency systems were housed in the one room , serviced by a single cable which , if destroyed , would render all safety operations useless .
this included the pumps for the reactor 's emergency cooling system .
it is therefore understandable why the european union made the decommissioning of ignalina one of its primary prerequisites for lithuania 's accession in 2004 .
pressure from the eu and the need to comply with the bloc 's stringent environmental rules forced the lithuanian government to order the closure of one of the plant 's reactors by 2005 .
the eu has issued a deadline for the complete decommissioning of ignalina by 2009 .
undoing 40 years of neglect nuclear safety in the applicant countries is a major political issue and one of the greatest challenges being faced by those involved in the enlargement process along with cleaning up over 40 years of environmental neglect in the former soviet and eastern bloc states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ussr 's solution for disposing of high-level radioactive waste had been to simply pump most of it underground , polluting subterranean water sources .
combined with leaks and accidents which laid huge swathes of land to waste , many soviet and eastern bloc states suffered from high levels of radioactive pollution .
but nuclear energy was far from the exclusive domain of such neglect – it also seeped over into virtually every other aspect of the environment .
a report issued by the polish independent trade union solidarity in the mid-1980 's did a pretty fair job of assessing the east 's environmental problems .
the report provided a laundry list of poland 's growing problems , illustrating how eastern bloc politicians often acted with brown rather than green thumbs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one-third of the country ’ s food is poisoned , one-fifth of the population is seriously endangered by air pollution , one third of polish rivers are completely dead , the baltic is dying , while 78 percent of lakes have levels of pollution that far exceed any acceptable standard . "
such a legacy puts the size of the task facing the new members into perspective .
it also demonstrates the colossal progress the new member states have made in depolluting their lands .
300 laws for cleaner living the environmental regulations that the accession countries must adhere to in order to meet the membership criteria of the eu amount to over 300 different laws that include standards for air , waste , water , industrial pollution control and risk management , nuclear safety and radiation protection .
the environmental dimension of the forthcoming enlargement presents greater challenges than in any previous accession .
the task involves closing the gap in the level of environmental protection between central and eastern europe and the rest of the eu while promoting economically and environmentally sustainable frameworks within the ten new member states so standards can be maintained once they have been reached .
greener pastures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for the environment margot wallström thus far , eu officials are pleased with the massive strides made by the accession states .
at a press conference last week , the eu commissioner for the environment , sweden 's margot wallström -lrb- photo -rrb- , lauded the incoming members for their efforts .
" all the new member states are for the most part on track ... they have had to make big efforts , " she said .
" from an environmental point of view , we are very happy . "
full compliance with the eu 's environmental regulations is not just a huge logistical undertaking but has also required a massive financial investment .
estimates place the total cost of getting the ten candidate countries up to spec in the region of € 100 - 120 billion .
the bulk of the investment is likely to be needed for infrastructure in air pollution abatement , water and waste water management and waste management .
final hurdles the candidate countries have already started to integrate the eu 's environmental regulations into their own national legislation but some are continuing to have problems accommodating eu policy into their own on a legal level .
there are also problems concerning the reinforcing of a wide range of environmental institutions within the candidate countries , particularly the integration of existing regional and local environmental inspectorates into networks of non-governmental organizations across the bloc as stipulated within the eu legislation .
while none of the candidate countries have satisfied all of the eu environmental regulations at the present time , almost all are expected to have implemented a satisfactory level of the regulations by the time accession comes around on may 1 , according to the european commission .
in a report released last week , the commission noted that key air pollutants in the new member states have declined by 60 to 80 percent .
the presence of toxic metals , meanwhile , have fallen by 50 percent .
and organic matter pollution in water has fallen as much as 80 percent .
but there are still areas that need improvement – especially in the areas of waste management , industrial pollution and conservation .
" the main problems have to do with the heavy pollution of the past , and the infrastructure .
but they have been working very hard to address those problems , " wallström said . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .
rudi völler took his euro 2004 hopefuls to romania on wednesday and saw his team lose 5-1 . a host of euro 2004 nations took to soccer fields all over the globe in a night of international friendly matches on wednesday as a number of teams looking forward to competing for the championship in portugal this summer continued their preparation .
for germany , however , it was a night of ill omens as the world cup runners-up crashed to their biggest away defeat for 65 years as a young and inexperienced romania team tore them to ribbons in bucharest . there could be no question that romania 's 5-1 defeat of the germans was the most spectacular result of the night .
romania , which failed to qualify for this summer 's tournament , stunned germany with a four goal rout in the first half .
that precipitated goalkeeper oliver kahn 's substitution at half-time and set up the former soccer superpower 's most humiliating night for over two years .
it was germany 's worst defeat since they also lost 5-1 at home to england in a world cup qualifier in september 2001 .
germany 's biggest losses were 6-0 against austria in 1931 and 8-3 by hungary at the 1954 world cup .
völler expected " a bit of disorder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler " i felt worse after the loss to england , but it still hurts , " a rueful völler said after the game .
" there is no excuse , although we 'll probably never play again with this line-up . "
" i expected a bit of a disorder in the back , but we made errors that made us look like amateurs .
but we 'll put it behind us , just like we put the england defeat behind us and went on to play a good world cup , " the coach said .
" all we can do for the first half is apologize to everyone . "
injury-hit side provides no excuses germany was without several leading players on wednesday night , including michael ballack , who pulled out just before kick-off with a calf injury .
but coach völler still had the luxury of fielding a number of seasoned internationals such as kahn , jens jeremies , carsten ramelow and dietmar hamann .
it was only romania 's second victory over germany in 12 matches , and they started building the win early in the game .
after germany 's kevin kuranyi had squandered what turned out to be his country 's only chance of the first half on 13 minutes , the romanians began to assert themselves .
victory built from early pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mihaita plesan put romania ahead 21 minutes into the match after he intercepted a bad pass from german midfielder fabian ernst and charged alone through the gaping defense to drive the ball past kahn into the roof of the net .
the romanians extended their lead two minutes later when razvan rat beat a german offside trap down the left flank , charged past arne friedrich into the unguarded penalty area and chipped the ball over an advancing kahn .
ionel danciulescu made his first goal after 35 minutes , getting the benefit of the doubt from the linesman when others may have flagged for offside .
the dinamo bucharest striker was first to the ball as a cross from ovidiu petre evaded the shell-shocked german defenders , leaving danciulescu to poke the ball past the advancing goalkeeper .
with two minutes left in the first half , danciulescu struck again , this time heading in unchallenged after a long cross by flavius stoican .
oliver kahn was replaced during the interval by stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who had flown to bucharest aboard a chartered aircraft shortly before the match .
despite taking his place on the bench to watch the second half , the german captain had nowhere to hide after shipping four goals . kahn faces the music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn " there is no excuse at all for this , " said kahn .
" we let ourselves be slaughtered .
it was humiliating .
it is a shame and a bitter setback .
i am lost for words . "
hildebrand had to wait considerably longer than kahn had before he too was picking the ball out of the german net as romania took their foot off the gas in the second half and saved germany even greater embarrassment .
after a couple of near misses where nicolae dica narrowly failed to connect with a low pass at the far post on 56 minutes and then hit the post six minutes later , substitute gabriel caramarin made it 5-0 in the 84th .
germany managed a consolation goal with three minutes to play but even that was a slice of luck .
a deflected shot left defender phillip lahm with an easy task to deny romanian keeper bogdan lobont a clean sheet .
tournament expectations take a dive this was germany 's fourth preparation match for euro 2004 .
the germans capitulated to the holders france in the 3-0 defeat in gelsenkirchen before beating croatia 2-1 and belgium 3-0 .
with forty-five days to go before the first match of the 2004 european championships in portugal , wednesday 's collapse was hardly a performance that would have instilled confidence in a team that had already limped its way through qualification for that tournament .

a document outlining a strategy to combat drug-related crime was signed by the police , the local authority and other community agencies on wednesday .
the main aims of the reading commitment are to provide support for addicts and their families and to educate young people about the dangers of drug abuse .
the move follows a drugs inquiry where people gave their views on the issue .

the scottish economic policy network said plans to increase the number of people settling in scotland do not go far enough .
it believes the 8,000 annual immigration target suggested by ministers should be revised to 50,000 .
scotland faces the fastest falling population anywhere in europe .
by 2009 it is expected that the country 's population will be below five million .
researchers for the network found that far more immigrants are needed to prevent the economy being damaged and public services being stretched by an ageing population .
population facts in 2041 life expectancy for women will be 82.6 years life expectancy for men will be 77.6 years scotland 's population will be below 4.5 million people aged 65 and older will be 1.2 million , an increase of 50 % children aged 15 and under will number 650,000 , a 30 % fall people aged 65 and over will represent 27 % of the population children aged 15 and under will represent 14 % of the population at present immigration is a reserved issue which is controlled by westminster .
author of the report , professor robert wright , said that was " a bizarre " set up and argued it was time the scottish parliament was given more immigration powers .
first minister jack mcconnell said earlier this year that the country 's falling population was the " single biggest challenge facing scotland in the 21st century " .
prof wright said in his report : " a targeted immigration policy which attracts young individuals in sufficient numbers would both stop population decline and slow population ageing .
' virtually powerless ' " in my view , if current demographic trends continue then population decline and population ageing will lead to a sizeable reduction in the standard of living of scottish people . "
the academic said that population ageing was a feature of most industrial nations with countries like germany looking at radical plans to reform its labour market , pensions and health systems .
jack mcconnell backs increased immigration however , he said it was unusual that there had been a lack of public debate and interest in the potential problems of population decline in scotland .
prof wright said : " it is somewhat bizarre that the scottish executive warns us that population decline is our ' number one ' problem and yet at the same time it is virtually powerless to do anything about it .
" there is no requirement on immigrants to locate or stay in a particular region .
without this conditionality , which is at the centre of immigration policy in other countries , then it is my view that scotland will never be able to attract and keep the number of immigrants it needs . "
the report states that a new visa system should be established which makes it conditional for an individual to stay in scotland for a " minimum period of time " .
growth concerns prof wright said that a target immigration figure for scotland of 50,000 per year would help the country .
he added : " such a number may seem unrealistically large .
however , in percentage terms it is not dissimilar to the targets set by , for example , australia , canada and new zealand . "
cbi scotland 's allan hogarth has warned the situation could harm the economy .
mr hogarth said : " it 's a twin-track problem - one , that it could adversely affect economic growth which is what we all want to see improve , plus it puts greater pressure on those currently working in public services . "

the scottish economic policy network said plans to increase the number of people settling in scotland do not go far enough .
it believes the 8,000 annual immigration target suggested by ministers should be revised to 50,000 .
scotland faces the fastest falling population anywhere in europe .
by 2009 it is expected that the country 's population will be below five million .
researchers for the network found that far more immigrants are needed to prevent the economy being damaged and public services being stretched by an ageing population .
population facts in 2041 life expectancy for women will be 82.6 years life expectancy for men will be 77.6 years scotland 's population will be below 4.5 million people aged 65 and older will be 1.2 million , an increase of 50 % children aged 15 and under will number 650,000 , a 30 % fall people aged 65 and over will represent 27 % of the population children aged 15 and under will represent 14 % of the population at present immigration is a reserved issue which is controlled by westminster .
author of the report , professor robert wright , said that was " a bizarre " set up and argued it was time the scottish parliament was given more immigration powers .
first minister jack mcconnell said earlier this year that the country 's falling population was the " single biggest challenge facing scotland in the 21st century " .
prof wright said in his report : " a targeted immigration policy which attracts young individuals in sufficient numbers would both stop population decline and slow population ageing .
' virtually powerless ' " in my view , if current demographic trends continue then population decline and population ageing will lead to a sizeable reduction in the standard of living of scottish people . "
the academic said that population ageing was a feature of most industrial nations with countries like germany looking at radical plans to reform its labour market , pensions and health systems .
jack mcconnell backs increased immigration however , he said it was unusual that there had been a lack of public debate and interest in the potential problems of population decline in scotland .
prof wright said : " it is somewhat bizarre that the scottish executive warns us that population decline is our ' number one ' problem and yet at the same time it is virtually powerless to do anything about it .
" there is no requirement on immigrants to locate or stay in a particular region .
without this conditionality , which is at the centre of immigration policy in other countries , then it is my view that scotland will never be able to attract and keep the number of immigrants it needs . "
the report states that a new visa system should be established which makes it conditional for an individual to stay in scotland for a " minimum period of time " .
growth concerns prof wright said that a target immigration figure for scotland of 50,000 per year would help the country .
he added : " such a number may seem unrealistically large .
however , in percentage terms it is not dissimilar to the targets set by , for example , australia , canada and new zealand . "

audit scotland said trusts were below the targets for 12 out of 19 day surgery procedures .
these included squint corrections and removal of breast lumps .
the report found that the percentage of day surgery cases varied across the country with argyll and clyde , tayside and grampian having the lowest rates .
less stressful audit scotland said an extra 5,700 procedures could be carried out each year if scotland 's trusts reached the targets set in 1998 .
it said scotland had lower day surgery rates than england and though patient numbers were rising the rate of increase had " slowed considerably " .
day surgery can be less stressful for patients , help cut hospital waiting lists , drive down the level of hospital acquired infection , reduce cancellations and offer better value for money .
deputy auditor general caroline gardner said : " some trusts may have reached their optimum level of day surgery , but other could do more to develop day surgery as an alternative to inpatient care . "

caroline gardner deputy auditor general the audit scotland report found that the percentage of day surgery cases varied considerably across scotland in 2002/03 and was " greater than can be explained by location or differences in patients ' circumstances " .
lothian and fife achieved 70 % of the targets while argyll and clyde , tayside and grampian achieved less than 25 % of the targets .
ms gardner said : " we 'd like to see nhs boards monitoring the levels of day surgery and taking action where day case rates are low .
" patients should get the right treatment for their needs , whether that is inpatient , day case or outpatient care . "
according to the nhs 's information and statistics division -lrb- isd -rrb- an inpatient breast lump removal operation costs £ 1266 compared with £ 511 for a day surgery procedure .

it sits next to a buddhist shrine which legend tells was built by the sister of the chinese convert to islam who founded the mosque .
images like this may only fuel discontent but the story also tells of how the sister cursed the mosque when her brother refused to renounce his islamic faith .
although construction began in 1578 , the mosque was never completed .
it is a prophetic story that illustrates how uncomfortable the historical relationship between muslims and buddhists has been in this region .
the thai provinces of songkhla , pattani and yala sit directly on the border with malaysia , and as well as marking a national boundary , this is the point at which the religious division of south-east asia moves from being predominantly buddhist to predominantly muslim .
over 100 years ago the kings of siam absorbed the islamic kingdom of pattani into their territory .
many people see this as the start of the region 's muslim insurgency .
others point to much more modern reasons for the problems in the south .
the three provinces have certainly failed to capitalise on the economic boom that has swept through the rest of thailand in recent years .
academics say the government has not accommodated the needs of the local community and loan schemes intended to promote development have excluded muslims .
muslim scholars also say that this has led to an increase in the dissemination of more radical islamic beliefs among young people .
they point to thailand 's active participation in the war against terror , and the presence of thai troops in iraq , as fuel for this radicalisation .
thailand 's government has seemed uncertain who to blame .
various officials have blamed muslim insurgents - sometimes saying they were localised , other times saying they were operating from across the border in malaysia - or bandits running lucrative smuggling routes over the border .
but so far the government has failed to find any solution for the troubles in the south and the scars left by wednesday 's attacks will take a very long time to heal .

jennifer hudson , who had been widely predicted to win , ended in the bottom three with fellow african-americans la toya london and fantasia barrino .
the result led sir elton to brand the public vote as " incredibly racist " after appearing as a guest judge on the tv talent show .
but cowell said hudson 's exit had given the competition a much needed shake-up .
better singers more than 20 million votes were telephoned in last week which were audited by an independent company , cowell said .
he added : " there are a lot of passive viewers who complain about the results but do n't pick up the phone or text a message .
" we needed a shake-up and i think it will change ... my gut feeling is we are going to attract 5-6 million new voters and the better singers now have a chance . "
" i am going to predict la toya and diana to be the two finalists ...
it 's just who i 'm guessing america will pick .
" if it was talent it would be la toya and fantasia , but i just do n't think it will be those two , " he said .
