but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .

" why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .

foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work . " wolfgang böhmer , state premier of saxony anhalt , also suggested germany has more days off than it needs , telling public broadcaster mdr that no one even knows what what the religious significance of ascension day is , for example . " if germany celebrates these public holidays simply in order to consume alcohol and without any kind of awareness of what the day means , then it 's time we began a debate , " he insisted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his thoughts were echoed by chairman of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber -lrb- pictured -rrb- .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives .

" returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .

stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .

but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .

over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .

stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .
down to ten men wolfsburg collapsed with marek mintal scoring a hat-trick . advocaat 's debut ends in stalemate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new mönchengladbach coach dick advocaat could not get off to a winning start .
elsewhere dutch manager dick advocaat failed to inspire borussia mönchengladbach to victory with his first match in charge ending in a 1-1 draw at mainz 05 .

the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .

german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .
" i think the us government began this process last year , and now it 's time for positive steps from the european side .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work . " wolfgang böhmer , state premier of saxony anhalt , also suggested germany has more days off than it needs , telling public broadcaster mdr that no one even knows what what the religious significance of ascension day is , for example . " if germany celebrates these public holidays simply in order to consume alcohol and without any kind of awareness of what the day means , then it 's time we began a debate , " he insisted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his thoughts were echoed by chairman of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber -lrb- pictured -rrb- . " we approve steps towards positive economic progress , " he said at a protestant congress sunday .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .
" winning was the main thing and that is what we did , " said stuttgart manager matthias sammer .
stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .
down to ten men wolfsburg collapsed with marek mintal scoring a hat-trick . advocaat 's debut ends in stalemate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new mönchengladbach coach dick advocaat could not get off to a winning start .
elsewhere dutch manager dick advocaat failed to inspire borussia mönchengladbach to victory with his first match in charge ending in a 1-1 draw at mainz 05 .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .
" winning was the main thing and that is what we did , " said stuttgart manager matthias sammer .
stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives .

" a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .

" returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work . " wolfgang böhmer , state premier of saxony anhalt , also suggested germany has more days off than it needs , telling public broadcaster mdr that no one even knows what what the religious significance of ascension day is , for example . " if germany celebrates these public holidays simply in order to consume alcohol and without any kind of awareness of what the day means , then it 's time we began a debate , " he insisted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his thoughts were echoed by chairman of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber -lrb- pictured -rrb- . " we approve steps towards positive economic progress , " he said at a protestant congress sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 08.11.2004 bayern , schalke increase pressure as wolves slip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay ended a barren spell with a goal in bayern 's 3-0 victory it 's getting very tight at the top of the bundesliga with wins for bayern munich and schalke 04 adding pressure on leaders wolfsburg .
schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .
" winning was the main thing and that is what we did , " said stuttgart manager matthias sammer .
stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .

" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .
" winning was the main thing and that is what we did , " said stuttgart manager matthias sammer .
stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .
down to ten men wolfsburg collapsed with marek mintal scoring a hat-trick . advocaat 's debut ends in stalemate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new mönchengladbach coach dick advocaat could not get off to a winning start .
elsewhere dutch manager dick advocaat failed to inspire borussia mönchengladbach to victory with his first match in charge ending in a 1-1 draw at mainz 05 .
" i am satisfied with the point but we can certainly raise our game , " said advocaat . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wolves open up lead in championship race the close bundesliga title race is beginning to fracture .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : fires , films and fashion german-turkish film " head-on " wins berlinale the yearning for kraut art " tainted art " controversy surrounds berlin exhibition the party 's over - life after moma business -pipe- 08.11.2004 great expectations … unfulfilled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , all that glitters is not gold when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , great things were predicted for the city that had been scarred by the barrier for nearly three decades .
but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

schalke went equal top on points but the wolves have better goal difference . bayern munich put their painful midweek european defeat to juventus behind them with a 3-0 triumph over hanover at the olympic stadium on saturday . the win moved felix magath 's side to within one point of leaders vfl wolfsburg who were crushed 4-0 by fc nuremberg .
the top of the table is now even tighter with schalke 04 level on 24 points with wolves in second while vfb stuttgart are third ahead of bayern on goal difference . hanover had won six bundesliga matches in a row , plundering 15 goals in the process , but bayern took no notice putting the visitors to the sword .
" we have played better than that this season but were a lot more effective in front of goal than in our last game , " declared bayern manager felix magath . bayern scored after just three minutes through claudio pizarro .
dutch international roy makaay released the peruvian who drilled a left-footed shot in from an acute angle . in the 31st minute referee lutz frohlich then took centre stage handing a second booking to german international michael ballack for a foul he did not commit .
after bayern players rounded frohlich the referee consulted his fourth official and bastian schweinsteiger , the real villain , was rightly awarded the yellow card in a bizarre incident .
" compliments to the referee , " said ballack .
" that does not happen very often . " bayern then showed their killer instinct - something that was missing against juventus - with makaay latching onto a pass from mehmet scholl to score in the 80th minute .
peruvian substitute paulo guerrero , 20 , added a third late on . stuttgart bounce back in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal rout could get stuttgart back on track .
bayern are in fourth level on points with stuttgart who defeated hansa rostock 4-0 on sunday .
" winning was the main thing and that is what we did , " said stuttgart manager matthias sammer .
stuttgart had lost their last three matches but moved back into the title battle with three points against the bundesliga basement boys hansa . schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick celebrated his sixth successive league win and equal top billing in the league with sv hamburg falling 2-1 on sunday .
hamburg led until the 79th minute before substitute mike hanke equalized and then brazilian lincoln produced a brilliant winner two minutes later . the samba star ran a full 60 meters with the ball before slotting home .
" i am in great form at the moment but then again so is the team , " admitted lincoln . bremen lose concentration and impetus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelos charisteas -lrb- first left -rrb- gave bremen the lead .
german champions werder bremen were left cursing a late concentration lapse in a 1-1 away draw at hertha berlin .
greece 's euro 2004 winner angelos charisteas had put bremen ahead in the 80th minute but werder could not hold onto that slender lead .
alexander madlung headed in an equalizer in the dying moments with bremen furious at the amount of added time . " the game was almost over but it is in the hands of the referee and that cost us two points , " raged bremen chief thomas schaaf . wolves tamed by rampant nuremberg wolfsburg lead the pack despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 score line at fc nuremberg .
trailing 1-0 , the wolves had argentine international andres d 'alessandro sent off in the eighth minute for a petulant foul .
d 'alessandro plunged his arm into the back of markus schroth and picked up a red card for his immature conduct . " the sending off was on the border line but we have to accept it , " admitted wolves coach erik gerets .
down to ten men wolfsburg collapsed with marek mintal scoring a hat-trick . advocaat 's debut ends in stalemate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new mönchengladbach coach dick advocaat could not get off to a winning start .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives .

" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .
" i think the us government began this process last year , and now it 's time for positive steps from the european side .

the proposal to scrap german unity day sparked a wider debate about what needs to be done to boost economic growth - no one wants to lose a public holiday , but they do n't want to work longer weeks either . when chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel suggested abolishing the day of german unity as a public holiday , they were unprepared for the torrent of indignation that followed .
they ditched the proposal as soon as it emerged that it lacked support even within their own ranks , but while the critics made it abundantly clear what they do n't want , eichel says he still has n't heard any reasonable alternatives . " i did n't hear a single persuasive and realistic option over the weekend , " said the finance minister on monday .
" it 's unacceptable that everyone objects to unpopular proposals but fails to come up with viable alternatives . " a return to the 40-hour working week ? after the government succumbed to pressure to revoke the plan , the focus of austerity measures needed to kickstart the economy shifted to the idea of reintroducing a 40-hour working week - a contentious move in a country where the 35-working week is sacrosanct . " returning to a 40-hour working week would be the equivalent of scrapping eleven public holidays , " said president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- michael rogowski in the weekly magazine focus .
he also observed that both unity day and labor day could equally well be celebrated on sunday , adding the controversial comment that labor day was a public holiday first introduced by adolf hitler . meanwhile , head of the christian social union edmund stoiber proposed cutting holiday entitlement , arguing that dispensing with one of germany 's up to 16 public holiday would have little effect .
" bavaria has the most public holidays in germany and also the highest growth " , he pointed out in bild am sonntag " everyone in germany needs to work more , " he added .
" that entails reintroducing the 40-hour working week on the factory floor and offices , and relinquishing our status as holiday world champion . " forfeiting another public holiday while the last few days have seen politicians across the board moot jettisoning just about every public holiday on the german calendar - including ephiphany and pentacost - the government has ruled out the proposal altogether . " a discussion of germany 's public holidays was begun , but it lasted 24 hours and it 's now finished , " said dieter wiefelspütz of the social democrats on public broadcaster ndr .
he went on to contest the nation 's fixation on public holiday .
" wealth is not something achieved by sitting at home or going on holiday , " he added .
" wealth is achieved through hard work . " wolfgang böhmer , state premier of saxony anhalt , also suggested germany has more days off than it needs , telling public broadcaster mdr that no one even knows what what the religious significance of ascension day is , for example . " if germany celebrates these public holidays simply in order to consume alcohol and without any kind of awareness of what the day means , then it 's time we began a debate , " he insisted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his thoughts were echoed by chairman of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber -lrb- pictured -rrb- . " we approve steps towards positive economic progress , " he said at a protestant congress sunday .

as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces . german opposition leaders are calling for an active participation in a nato-led training program currently underway in iraq .
foreign policy expert for the christian democrats wolfgang schäuble criticized the government of chancellor gerhard schröder for not doing enough to promote security and democracy in iraq .
following the re-election of us president george w. bush , germany should show its support for the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country , where democracy is still a fragile force frequently undermined by armed rebels , schäuble said in an interview with financial times deutschland .
germany must reconsider its current policy of resisting troop deployment to iraq , he said in the monday edition .
poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .

poisoning relations although berlin agreed back in september to participate in the nato program to train iraqi police and military , its contribution to the international initiative has been limited to providing transportation vehicles and instructing the security forces outside the country in the united arab emirates .
schröder and his coalition government of social democrats and greens have refused to budge on their opposition to deploying german troops in iraq .
but schäuble has called that position " poison " in the transatlantic ties .
" withholding german soldiers from an integrated nato contingent is poison for the atlantic partnership , " he told the newspaper .
" that is exactly what weakens multilateralism . "
the us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , also came out strong against germany 's reluctance to contribute substantially to the rebuilding of iraq in a handelsblatt interview .
the debate in nato over training iraqi security forces is counterproductive , he said .
every member state understands this issue takes absolute priority , " but nonetheless , nato is occupying itself with a never-ending stream of arguments from half a dozen countries who refuse to participate . "
over the weekend , german defense minister peter struck reiterated the government 's opposition to setting foot in iraq and stressed instead that germany would play its role in training iraqi expeditionary forces and mine-disposal experts , outside the country , if required .
increasing nato 's participation altogether nato is sending about 40 officers to iraq and neighboring countries to train police and soldiers - a paltry contribution according to the us , which has lobbied for an increased nato presence in the unstable country .
according to washington , nato should increase the numbers of troops in iraq to 3,000 , of which only about a tenth would be military trainers .
given the unbroken cycle of violence since the us handed over control to an interim government at the end of june and the upcoming elections in january , the us defense department has been adamant about getting its transatlantic partners more involved in securing iraq .
daniel coats , who has been cited as a possible successor to current defense secretary donald rumsfeld , has said that a more active involvement in iraq could go a long way in improving the strained relations between europe and the united states .
" both sides should take a few steps towards each other , " he told handelsblatt .
" i think the us government began this process last year , and now it 's time for positive steps from the european side .

but 15 years later , berlin is still far from meeting the rosy business forecasts . on november 9 , 1989 , berlin 's seemingly impenetrable barrier of concrete and barbed wire was breeched .
throngs of east germans rushed into west berlin and revelers began picking apart the hated structure with sledgehammers and pickaxes . television pictures beamed images of germans from both sides of the city joined together around and on top of the wall celebrating the historic moment .
in late 1989 , the eyes of the world were on berlin , a once and future capital whose future seemed bright . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz but 15 years later , berlin has failed to live up to a lot of the - admittedly unrealistic - expectations that formed in those heady days after the fall of the wall . many envisioned a reunited berlin would blossom into a metropolis comparable to london or paris .
the potential was there , experts argued : tearing down the artificial barrier , moving the government back to its original home and pumping millions of euros into high-profile construction projects would begin a snowball effect that would end up turning the city into an economic and cultural dynamo . at least that 's how the thinking went . " there was an initial euphoria about berlin and what it could become , " karl brenke , a researcher at berlin 's german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , told dw-world .
" but then it started going downhill , more quickly than anyone expected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schering , the only major industrial group headquartered in berlin while several areas of berlin today literally sparkle with vigor and possibility , such as the glass and chrome towers of potsdamer platz or the splashy facades of boutiques on friedrichstraße , under the surface lurks a serious case of economic malaise .
the boutiques on friedrichstraße are usually empty , the landlords of potsdamer platz 's skyscrapers can not find tenants . few in berlin can afford to shop in the high-end stores .
figures from september show 17.4 percent of berliners are unemployed and more than 171,000 receive some kind of welfare check . industry staying away instead of the bloom experts predicted once the wall was gone , the city has lost around 22,000 industrial sector jobs since reunification in 1990 .
total job losses for the city have been estimated at as high as 150,000 . according to the diw 's brenke , it is understandable that companies have been reluctant to set up shop in berlin , since the last time the city had a sizeable industrial base was before wwii .
when berlin became politically isolated from the rest of west germany , many large companies moved their operations west . engineering giant siemens left berlin after the war , opting to move its base to munich .
although it still employees thousands in berlin , it will keep its headquarters in munich since like many , it sees no economic justification for a move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " walk of fashion 2004 " in berlin featured berlin labels and designers pharmaceuticals company schering is the only major industrial group to have its headquarters in the capital . smaller industries in west berlin largely depended on subsidies from the then-capital bonn .
when those supports fell away , many firms went under . east berlin was never a very important industrial location for the gdr and most of those companies which did have headquarters in berlin did not survive the transition to capitalism . " why should industry move to berlin , when the infrastructure is n't there ? " said brenke .
he added that unlike paris or london , all important economic sectors are not concentrated in one city .
for example , many media companies are headquartered in cologne ; much of publishing is in hamburg ; munich and stuttgart are strongholds of the car industry . gleaming office blocks , any takers ? those overly optimistic predictions about berlin 's post-reunification population and job development led to a massive building boom of both apartment and office space that stretched into the late 1990s . " but the expected development did n't happen and we were left with a lot of empty buildings , " hiltrud sprungala , manager of the federal association of real estate companies , told dw-world . according to her , around 250,000 were built in berlin and the immediate environs , enough for some 500,000 people .
yet between 1994 and 2000 , 93,000 residents left the city . despite rock-bottom rents for office space in many areas of berlin , the vacancy rate now stands at around 10 percent , a worrying percentage for the real estate market , given that no increase in demand is in sight . creative environment while its track record bringing in industry and entrepreneurs is n't stellar , berlin has been far more successful in attracting artists and others working in creative fields . # b # they have been flocking to berlin since reunification and have turned the city into a mecca of new art , cutting-edge fashion design and music . the media sector has become more important .
universal music built a new headquarters on the city 's spree river , the axel spring press group building sits next to where the wall used to run and mtv germany has moved to berlin from munich . tourism has also been booming , with the city 's tourist board reporting record numbers of visitors to the city in 2004 .
ironically , the former path of the berlin wall is major attraction .
part of the wall around checkpoint charlie has been rebuilt . " there have been a few sectors that have done well and whose prospects for the future looks good , " said researcher brenke .
" but as an engine to get the economy moving , they just are n't enough .

the scandal broke out in the eastern anhui province last april .
