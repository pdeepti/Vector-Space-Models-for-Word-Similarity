german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .
in germany , every fourth child is born per cesarean . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links heidi 's official site ! 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .
the rai board of directors has traditionally been filled with political appointees according to which parties form the ruling governmental coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- not only exercises control over rai as prime minister , but his family owns a vast media empire , including three private television channels .
he is said to effectively control 90 percent of the italian media .
as of wednesday , berlusconi is italy 's longest-serving prime minister since world war ii .
italy only " partly free " annunziata is the second prominent rai employee to leave the state broadcaster in protest against political influence in the past week .
one of italy 's best known television anchors , lilli gruber , quit her job friday , while accusing berlusconi of hurting the italian media by pursuing his political and business interests . before joining the rai board , annunziata was a news executive at ap.biscom , an independent italian news agency .
she had previously been a reporter for one of rai 's three channels and the newspapers corriera della sera and la repubblica . in a survey published by the nonprofit organization freedom house on monday , italy ranked 74th in the world for press freedom , after benin , botswana and the solomon islands , and was considered only " partly free .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .
the rai board of directors has traditionally been filled with political appointees according to which parties form the ruling governmental coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- not only exercises control over rai as prime minister , but his family owns a vast media empire , including three private television channels .
he is said to effectively control 90 percent of the italian media .
as of wednesday , berlusconi is italy 's longest-serving prime minister since world war ii .
italy only " partly free " annunziata is the second prominent rai employee to leave the state broadcaster in protest against political influence in the past week .
one of italy 's best known television anchors , lilli gruber , quit her job friday , while accusing berlusconi of hurting the italian media by pursuing his political and business interests . before joining the rai board , annunziata was a news executive at ap.biscom , an independent italian news agency .
she had previously been a reporter for one of rai 's three channels and the newspapers corriera della sera and la repubblica . in a survey published by the nonprofit organization freedom house on monday , italy ranked 74th in the world for press freedom , after benin , botswana and the solomon islands , and was considered only " partly free .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .
in germany , every fourth child is born per cesarean . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links heidi 's official site ! 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.05.2004 german fuel prices hover near record mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as petrol prices stay at record levels , people are considering other ways of getting from a to b. two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .

" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "

13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.05.2004 gm crop trials underway throughout germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say gm crops are unsafe a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .
the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .
the group has called for a referendum to decide the future of gm crops . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu requires labels for gm food a new eu directive requiring labels for genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- food took effect sunday : some hailed it as a way to give people more choice , opponents said it did not go far enough as it excludes animal products .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "

heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .

birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .

13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .
in germany , every fourth child is born per cesarean . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links heidi 's official site ! 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .

in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .
in the united states , where heidi resides most of the time , the c-section has turned into a lifestyle operation for 50 percent of patients in private birthing clinics .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .

in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .

in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .

" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 bombs explode in athens ahead of olympics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police investigators search the site of the attacks .
one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .

there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .

german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .
the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- eu proposes end to china arms embargo the european union is expected to make a huge step in its relationship with china this month by ending a 15-year arms embargo .
but human rights group amnesty international has condemned the proposal .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .

but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.05.2004 german fuel prices hover near record mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as petrol prices stay at record levels , people are considering other ways of getting from a to b. two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .

but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .
the group has called for a referendum to decide the future of gm crops . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu requires labels for gm food a new eu directive requiring labels for genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- food took effect sunday : some hailed it as a way to give people more choice , opponents said it did not go far enough as it excludes animal products .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .
yusgiantoro , who is also indonesia 's energy minister , blamed the oil price increase in the world market on the recent terrorist attack in saudi arabia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green gasoline to debut in eu drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .

they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.05.2004 german fuel prices hover near record mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as petrol prices stay at record levels , people are considering other ways of getting from a to b. two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .
yusgiantoro , who is also indonesia 's energy minister , blamed the oil price increase in the world market on the recent terrorist attack in saudi arabia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green gasoline to debut in eu drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .

the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .
the group has called for a referendum to decide the future of gm crops . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu requires labels for gm food a new eu directive requiring labels for genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- food took effect sunday : some hailed it as a way to give people more choice , opponents said it did not go far enough as it excludes animal products .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified .

her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .

she had previously been a reporter for one of rai 's three channels and the newspapers corriera della sera and la repubblica . in a survey published by the nonprofit organization freedom house on monday , italy ranked 74th in the world for press freedom , after benin , botswana and the solomon islands , and was considered only " partly free .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .
the rai board of directors has traditionally been filled with political appointees according to which parties form the ruling governmental coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- not only exercises control over rai as prime minister , but his family owns a vast media empire , including three private television channels .
he is said to effectively control 90 percent of the italian media .
as of wednesday , berlusconi is italy 's longest-serving prime minister since world war ii .
italy only " partly free " annunziata is the second prominent rai employee to leave the state broadcaster in protest against political influence in the past week .
one of italy 's best known television anchors , lilli gruber , quit her job friday , while accusing berlusconi of hurting the italian media by pursuing his political and business interests . before joining the rai board , annunziata was a news executive at ap.biscom , an independent italian news agency .
she had previously been a reporter for one of rai 's three channels and the newspapers corriera della sera and la repubblica . in a survey published by the nonprofit organization freedom house on monday , italy ranked 74th in the world for press freedom , after benin , botswana and the solomon islands , and was considered only " partly free .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "

on tuesday , a request was sent to danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen by the representatives of the territories in the danish parliament .
according to the letter , the northern atlantic representatives in the folketing are worried about the possible impact of closer european cooperation , particularly in common foreign and defense policy .
the so-called danish realm community , which includes denmark , the faroe islands and greenland , grants autonomy to greenland and the faroe islands in many fields , but foreign policy is still governed from copenhagen .
greenland left the eu in 1985 , and the faroe islands decided not to join in 1973 .
the two territories have cooperation agreements with the eu on several issues including trade and fisheries .
the question of defense policy is especially significant when it comes to the thule airbase in greenland .
negotiations are currently going on between denmark and the united states about the possible use of thule in u.s. plans for a missile defense system .
denmark has a defense agreement with the us dating back to 1951 .
it wants to renew the agreement , but the greenlanders want more influence on the decision .
" whether denmark will let the eu run its foreign and security policy , is a danish decision .
however , we have to remind you , that some of what you are about to give up does not belong to you .
it belongs to us " , said lars-emil johansen , one of greenland 's two representatives in the danish parliament , during a recent hearing .

on tuesday , a request was sent to danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen by the representatives of the territories in the danish parliament .
according to the letter , the northern atlantic representatives in the folketing are worried about the possible impact of closer european cooperation , particularly in common foreign and defense policy .
the so-called danish realm community , which includes denmark , the faroe islands and greenland , grants autonomy to greenland and the faroe islands in many fields , but foreign policy is still governed from copenhagen .
greenland left the eu in 1985 , and the faroe islands decided not to join in 1973 .
the two territories have cooperation agreements with the eu on several issues including trade and fisheries .
the question of defense policy is especially significant when it comes to the thule airbase in greenland .
negotiations are currently going on between denmark and the united states about the possible use of thule in u.s. plans for a missile defense system .
denmark has a defense agreement with the us dating back to 1951 .
it wants to renew the agreement , but the greenlanders want more influence on the decision .
" whether denmark will let the eu run its foreign and security policy , is a danish decision .
however , we have to remind you , that some of what you are about to give up does not belong to you .
it belongs to us " , said lars-emil johansen , one of greenland 's two representatives in the danish parliament , during a recent hearing .

on tuesday , a request was sent to danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen by the representatives of the territories in the danish parliament .
according to the letter , the northern atlantic representatives in the folketing are worried about the possible impact of closer european cooperation , particularly in common foreign and defense policy .
the so-called danish realm community , which includes denmark , the faroe islands and greenland , grants autonomy to greenland and the faroe islands in many fields , but foreign policy is still governed from copenhagen .
greenland left the eu in 1985 , and the faroe islands decided not to join in 1973 .
the two territories have cooperation agreements with the eu on several issues including trade and fisheries .
the question of defense policy is especially significant when it comes to the thule airbase in greenland .
negotiations are currently going on between denmark and the united states about the possible use of thule in u.s. plans for a missile defense system .
denmark has a defense agreement with the us dating back to 1951 .
it wants to renew the agreement , but the greenlanders want more influence on the decision .
" whether denmark will let the eu run its foreign and security policy , is a danish decision .
however , we have to remind you , that some of what you are about to give up does not belong to you .
it belongs to us " , said lars-emil johansen , one of greenland 's two representatives in the danish parliament , during a recent hearing .

this first step is an application to join the so-called exchange rate mechanism ii -lrb- erm ii -rrb- .
inside this mechanism , a member state 's currency must remain stable against the euro for a period of two years .
after participation in erm ii , other economic criteria are assessed , such as whether a country can control their deficits and inflation .
if these tests are passed , a country is permitted to join the euro .
an estonian source told the euobserver that estonia was " ready to join as soon as possible , " although stressed no deadline had been set .
other new member states have curbed their initial enthusiasm for joining the single currency .
poland had hoped to join in 2006 , but has moved this back to 2009 .
a czech diplomat confirmed that the czech republic hoped to join " in 2007 at the earliest . "
some of the larger newcomers will have to undertake radical reform programs to reduce their budget deficits prior to joining the euro .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .

there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc four new states on quick sprint to euro entry four new member states - estonia , lithuania , slovenia and cyprus - have indicated that they intend to take the first steps towards eventual adoption of the euro by the end of this year , leading to final adoption in late 2006 .
this first step is an application to join the so-called exchange rate mechanism ii -lrb- erm ii -rrb- .
inside this mechanism , a member state 's currency must remain stable against the euro for a period of two years .
after participation in erm ii , other economic criteria are assessed , such as whether a country can control their deficits and inflation .
if these tests are passed , a country is permitted to join the euro .
an estonian source told the euobserver that estonia was " ready to join as soon as possible , " although stressed no deadline had been set .

this first step is an application to join the so-called exchange rate mechanism ii -lrb- erm ii -rrb- .
inside this mechanism , a member state 's currency must remain stable against the euro for a period of two years .
after participation in erm ii , other economic criteria are assessed , such as whether a country can control their deficits and inflation .
if these tests are passed , a country is permitted to join the euro .
an estonian source told the euobserver that estonia was " ready to join as soon as possible , " although stressed no deadline had been set .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .
the two leaders also agreed to double bilateral trade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.05.2004 gm crop trials underway throughout germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say gm crops are unsafe a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .
the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .
the group has called for a referendum to decide the future of gm crops . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu requires labels for gm food a new eu directive requiring labels for genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- food took effect sunday : some hailed it as a way to give people more choice , opponents said it did not go far enough as it excludes animal products .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model heidi klum is seen backstage at the victoria 's secret fashion show , nov .
13 , 2003 in new york .
heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2004 chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao on tour in europe .
on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .
on thursday wen departs for rome , and is scheduled to visit britain and ireland before heading back to china . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , wen pledge to boost bilateral trade chancellor schröder reaffirmed his " one-china policy " on monday during a meeting with chinese prime minister wen jiabao in berlin .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .

they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .
regular criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rai 's logo annunziata frequently criticized berlusconi 's influence on rai during her tenure as the board 's president since march 2003 .
in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .
the law , which relaxes limits on media ownership and reforms the advertising market , was finally passed last week .
the rai board of directors has traditionally been filled with political appointees according to which parties form the ruling governmental coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi berlusconi -lrb- photo -rrb- not only exercises control over rai as prime minister , but his family owns a vast media empire , including three private television channels .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .

rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .
u.s. fuel prices were at all-time record high levels as motorists shared the traders ' concerns that refiners will struggle to meet demand for fuel during the driving season that begins later this month when american motorists take to the roads to begin their summer vacations . demand for fuel causes concerns the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline for delivery in june leapt 4.38 cents to a record $ 1.3058 dollars .
" all depends on what happens to the gasoline -lrb- stocks -rrb- , " commerzbank oil analyst david thomas told german broadcaster n-tv .
" if we see continued tightness in gasoline inventories , than gasoline futures will remain near their record levels . " " if we see a smaller than expected build or even a draw in gasoline stocks , demonstrating a high demand that supply can not meet at the moment , then gasoline and crude prices will continue to go higher , " said thomas . opec says there is no shortage the fear that there will be a fuel shortage is an unwarranted one , according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- .
although prices have soared recently , purnomo yusgiantoro , the president of opec , said the cartel 's members were exceeding their agreed production ceiling by 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- . at a meeting in march , opec agreed to cut oil output by one million bpd to reduce total production to 23.5 million from april 1.the excess production of 1.5 million bpd has however left the grouping 's total production to 25 million bpd , yusgiantoro was quoted as saying by the indonesian state antara news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.05.2004 german fuel prices hover near record mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as petrol prices stay at record levels , people are considering other ways of getting from a to b. two days after the price of fuel began to sky rocket , petrol prices continue to be unusually high .
the price in germany is no exception with a liter still hovering around record levels . gasoline prices were still sky-high on wednesday after many countries around the world reported record highs on tuesday .
fuel in germany , which topped the € 1.20 -lrb- $ 1.45 -rrb- a liter price barrier and recorded its highest fuel prices in over a decade on tuesday , was still hovering around that mark a day later as prices in the united states continued to set new precedents . in all , prices eased slightly around the world on wednesday , a day after surging to levels last seen in 1990 in the run-up to the first gulf war , amid jitters over u.s. gasoline supplies and violence in saudi arabia .
a gun attack at an oil facility there over the weekend killed five people and sent shockwaves through financial markets at the start of the week .
the fallout was still being felt in europe and especially in germany where added tax does nothing to help in times of high prices forced upward by instability in countries responsible for the production of oil .
german motorists were forced into paying around € 1.20 per liter for their premium fuel on wednesday with petrol company aral recording a slight drop in price from the week 's high point with a liter in some stations costing 119.9 cents .
the average price , taken from the company 's 2,600 gas stations , set petrol at 117.9 cents per liter and diesel at 95.9 cents .
energy giant shell estimated this week that the rise could push up the annual petrol bill for drivers in germany on average by € 100 .
calls for reductions in eco tax the automobile club of germany -lrb- avd -rrb- called on the government to lower the eco tax on petrol in view of the record prices .
" it is now a matter of pulling the emergency brake on the prices .
many people ca n't even afford to get to work , " said spokesperson jochen hövekenmeier on tuesday in a statement from the club 's headquarters in frankfurt am main . however , the german government sees no need to take action because of the high fuel prices .
there is no reason for legislative measures concerning gasoline prices , " especially not with the eco tax , " a spokesperson for the finance ministry told reporters on wednesday . huge losses to revenue if prices cut around 70 percent of the price of fuel in germany is made up of taxes and delivery costs .
the tax on fuel amounts to almost 65.5 cents a liter and is not affected by changes in fuel prices .
regardless of the rise in price , the tax will remain set at that rate .
on top of that , there is 16 percent value added tax .
if the government were to lower the price of fuel , it would stand to lose € 13 billion in income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices in the us are at an all time high .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .
the eu maintains the time is not yet right to resume weapons sales to china .
on wednesday , the subject was not even brought up during the premier 's meeting with the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana , a spokesman said .
wen faces trade complaints instead of focusing on the weapons embargo as wen had hoped , the eu greeted the arrival of china 's leader with a list of trade complaints ranging from accusations of product piracy to rules blocking european companies from winning construction contracts for the 2008 olympics in beijing .
endemic counterfeiting of everything from computer software to music , movies and designer fashion have cost western companies some $ 16 billion in sales each year , according to estimates from international trade groups .
the united states and europe have appealed to china to adhere to the rules of the world trade organization and intervene to stop the trade violations .
speaking to a business conference in berlin on tuesday , wen said foreign companies could expect to see stronger enforcement of new anti-piracy regulations and the prosecution of small-scale counterfeiters .
on thursday at an eu-china business conference he plans to initial a cooperation agreement that eu officials have called a " crucial step forward " in putting a stop to the infringement of intellectual property rights .
the deal will clear the way for cooperation between customs offices .
other disputes in the way of boosting eu-china trade involve new chinese rules and qualifications that make it difficult for european construction companies to bid on large building contracts , and limits on coke exports for european steel producers .
forging strategic partnerships for both parties , much is at stake if the trade disputes are allowed to get out of hand .
last year china overtook japan to become the eu 's second-largest trading partner after the united states , while the eu is china 's third largest .
bilateral trade grew 13.5 percent to € 134.8 billion in 2003 .
" china is becoming more and more a global player and , with the new enlargement , the eu 's influence is assuming new dimensions at home and abroad , " commission president romano prodi said ahead of his talks with wen on thursday .
" in this context , i believe the eu and china have an ever-growing interest in working together as strategic partners to promote sustainable development , peace and stability worldwide and in reinforcing their cooperation across the board . "
prodi and wen are also set to discuss human rights , north korea , myanmar and iraq , according to the european commission .

on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues . wen jiabao had a clear objective when he set out for the eu headquarters on wednesday .
with a joint declaration boosting trade ties and political links between germany and china already in his pocket after his visit to berlin , the chinese premier is aiming for a larger pledge of partnership from the european union .
top on his list of goals is the removal of a weapons embargo imposed by the eu in 1989 after the tiananmen square massacre .
last december eu leaders had agreed to review the ban after pressure was applied by france and germany , who claim the sanctions had outlived their usefulness .
both countries are eager to sell sophisticated weapons to china 's large and big-spending military , and analysts say china is keen to gain access to cutting-edge european technology .
but a number of smaller eu countries , headed by the netherlands and scandinavian members , argue that beijing needs to do more to safeguard human rights .
the united states has also lobbied brussels hard against removing the embargo .
on monday , however , wen 's campaign received new impetus from german chancellor gerhard schröder who spoke out in favor of removing the restrictions and pledged to push brussels to drop the ban .
but the positive words from berlin are not enough to convince brussels to change its " wait and see " position .

german supermodel heidi klum has given birth to a baby girl named leni .
less than 24 hours old , she is already making a splash with her good looks - but what else is expected for a child of the woman with " perfect dna . " the 30-year old cover model of sports illustrated and victoria 's secret fame is now a first-time mommy .
" my name is leni , " the 3.750 gram baby girl told the world via her mother 's web site on wednesday morning .
the offspring of the woman described by some as having " perfect dna , " is a looker herself , at least according to those privileged enough to see her .
" everyone 's told me that with my long hair , i 'm already a pretty baby , " the makers of heidi 's web site " quoted " leni as saying .
allegedly , the healthy and happy baby spoke out " loud and strong " directly after the birth , before being given " the best food in the world " and falling fast asleep .
natural birth , no complications the supermodel 's grandfather , günther , told the regional kölner express the birth was a natural one without complications .
heidi 's mother accompanied her daughter in the new york clinic .
the baby 's father , italian formula one boss flavio briatore , was not mentioned on the web site , and , according to various press reports , was not present during the birth .
the relationship with briatore , a 53-year-old multimillionaire frequently seen in the company of beautiful women , has been the subject of much speculation in the tabloid press recently .
shortly before the birth , the model and the race car chief were rumored to have separated .
the two supposedly had too many different job commitments and too little time for each other .
but they both vowed to be " great parents . "

heidi , who was named " most desirable woman " by new york magazine , said last year that there was no greater wish for her than to be a mother .
doing it the traditional way heidi 's decision for a natural birth , as opposed to a cesarean , goes against the current trend among supermodels and hollywood stars .
claudia schiffer , cindy crawford , kate winslet , madonna , victoria beckham - they all opted for a birth on the operating table .
birth by scalpel is becoming a more and more popular choice for the beautiful and wealthy , who prefer the planning and relative lack of pain it offers .

the head of italy 's rai state-backed television network resigned on tuesday , saying prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government was exerting too much pressure on the broadcaster . lucia annunziata said she was leaving her position at the head of italy 's biggest media organization because of " stifling " government interference .
according to press reports , she complained that the rai board of directors had become little more than a " mail box in which decisions taken in places outside the company are ratified . " annunziata 's resignation was apparently triggered by nominations for key posts at rai that the board was due to decide on the same day .
her announcement came just 30 minutes before the board was set to meet in milan .
annunziata said the company was being " occupied " berlusconi 's backers , and she alleged that the board had received the nominations merely three hours before members were supposed to vote on them . berlusconi 's supporters denied there was undue government influence and denounced annaziata .
deputy prime minister gianfranco fini said her resignation should be seen in the context of upcoming european and local elections .
her allegations were " simply ridiculous , " he said .

in recent months , she suggested she would resign if controversial legislation was passed that critics said was designed to benefit berlusconi 's extensive media business interests .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "

" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.05.2004 gm crop trials underway throughout germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say gm crops are unsafe a field with genetically-modified wheat was destroyed by hoe-toting vandals tuesday night .
the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .

one hundred days before the greek city plays host to the olympics , three bombs exploded outside a police station .
no one was injured , but the blasts rattled security forces worried about terror attacks during the event . during the early morning hours wednesday three bombs exploded outside a police station in the southern athens suburb of kallithea .
the blasts broke windows in the building and rocked adjacent shops and apartments ; no one was injured .
the explosions , which occurred within a half hour , came as the city struggles to ready itself for the olympics on aug .
13-29 .
with just 100 days left before the opening ceremony , athens is well into the final stretch of preparations , including the planning of a major security operation designed to ward off fears of terror attacks .
a terrorist link ?
worried their security efforts could be thrown into question , greek authorities were quick to play down a link between wednesday 's bombs and the games .
" none of the facts obtained so far indicate that today 's incident is linked to preparation for the olympics , " greek government spokesman theodoros roussopoulos said in a statement .
nonetheless , coming so shortly before the event , the blasts trigger fears among the international community , who worry athens is not doing enough to ensure security .
" any bomb that goes off in athens is worrying , " said bob elphinston , secretary general of the australian olympic committee and member of a seven-nation security advisory panel .
" this is now the olympic city and whether it 's a coincidence that it 's 100 days to the games - time will tell . "
homegrown violence the police said their main line of investigation was into local extremist groups .
the bombs - each made from three sticks of dynamite triggered by alarm clocks - were referred to as " homemade exploding devices . "
an anonymous caller to an athens newspaper warned of the attacks about 10 minutes in advance , but gave no motive or claim of responsibility .
police believe the bombings are the work of domestic groups , most likely one of several urban guerrilla organizations the authorities have cracked down on in recent months .
under intense pressure to safeguard the olympics , greek security forces have been working to dismantle local terror groups and arrest members of the extremist organizations november 17 and the people 's revolutionary struggle -lrb- ela -rrb- , which were blamed for twin bombings at a court complex in athens last september .
but in recent months , the country has seen a resurgence in low-level urban violence , with a string of arson attacks against commercial targets and cars .
police believe the attacks are carried out by anarchist groups which do not have the capacity to stage large-scale operations .
in april , the u.s. state department 's annual report on terrorism said the " low-level bombings against an array of perceived establishment and so-called imperialist targets ... underscore the lingering nature of left-wing terrorism in greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured are athena , in orange shirt , and phevos , the mascots for the athens 2004 olympics securing the olympics " such things have happened frequently in the past , " greek deputy foreign minister evrypidis stylianidis told flash radio , referring to his country 's struggle with domestic violence .
" we must be on alert , but we should not exaggerate , " he said , seeking to calm fears .
whether local extremists or international terrorists , athens has invested a great deal in protecting the olympic games , the first since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has allocated more than 50,000 police and army personnel to ensure security and is spending over 650 million euros -lrb- $ 780 million -rrb- on related equipment .
the overall price tag for security - at least € 1 billion - makes the 2004 games the most expensive in history .
designed to prevent and defend against a possible terror threat , the security system includes a planned citywide network of surveillance cameras and aerial patrols .
government officials have also appealed to the eu and nato to provide assistance .
" the greek authorities , in cooperation with the relevant european union , united states and nato authorities , have designed a security system which guarantees the olympic games will run smoothly , " roussopoulos said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new greek government says athens will be ready the new greek government has assured jacques rogge , the head of the international olympic committee , that athens will be ready in time to play host to the olympic summer games this year .

the local government responded with the revelation that gm crops are being tested in no less than seven of germany 's 16 states . police still do n't know who is responsible for damaging and pulling up genetically-modified wheat plants in a 400 square meter- -lrb- 480 square yard -rrb- field near bernburg in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt on tuesday night .
but until the field was sabotaged , the german media said only two outdoor trials with gm crops were underway in the country . the government of saxon-anhalt , however , reacted to the attack by announcing that gm crops are being cultivated on 29 locations which the state has been keeping secret .
the eastern german state initiated the project to explore gm crops ' resistance to pests . state economics minister horst rehberger said gm corn crops were being cultivated in baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , saxony and thuringia as well as saxony-anhalt .
the 300 hectares -lrb- 740 acres -rrb- of gm corn would only be used for animal feed , he said .
the state is funding the trials with € 390,000 -lrb- $ 474,000 -rrb- , € 240,000 of which have been reserved to compensate farmers for any damages during the project , the state government said . fear of attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers involved in the corn trials have not been named because they fear gm opponents will destroy their fields , as they did tuesday night in the second attack on a gm wheat field .
rehberger said he would have preferred that the names not be kept secret , but that he accepted the farmers wishes . the swiss firm syngenta , whose wheat was used in the destroyed bernburg field , said it would review whether to continue testing gm crops in germany .
the wheat had been developed to resist fungi . activists from the environmental group greenpeace had already ruined a field of syngenta wheat in march by sowing organic seed where gm seed had been planted .
greenpeace said it was not involved in the attack on tuesday . farmers , greenpeace protest organic farmers and environmental groups have been protesting in front of saxon-anhalt 's economics ministry against the gm trials .
they allege that genetically-modified crops pose dangers for humans and animals and that safety can not be guaranteed . but saxony-anhalt 's agriculture minister , petra wernicke , said wednesday that the corn met environmental and health requirements .
the trials are intended to test whether the plant can stand up to the european corn borer , an insect that has reportedly infested nearly one-quarter of germany 's corn crops , according to the associated press . german opponents of gm crops established a grassroots organization weeks ago to fight gm technologies being used in saxon-anhalt .

she became prime minister on 4 may 1979 and went on to earn the nickname ' the iron lady ' , becoming renowned for her strong response to the falklands crisis , her programme of privatisation and her disputes with british miners .

the loss of the asw pension funds prompted the introduction of the pensions bill in february this year , which would set up a pension protection fund to help guarantee workers their pensions even if their employer goes bust .

the berkshire hathaway investment gurus certainly dispense one-liners with the best .
there 's magnetism as they opine with wit together .
one sets up the other one 's quip .
usually , it 's dead-pan munger and funny-man buffett .
wisdom as they played to the crowd of nearly 20,000 shareholders in their own home town , mr buffett conveyed his joy : " we feel like singing ' my way ' . "
to which munger replied ; " i have n't had so much fun since my sister won the large tomato growing contest in greater omaha " .
the difference between this duo and your average act is that buffett & munger intersperse their wit with a mountain of wisdom - profitable wisdom for the shareholders who glow with the astounding growth of their holdings .
after all , if you bought a share in berkshire hathaway in 1978 for $ 175 , you could sell it now for $ 93,390 .
natural talent warren buffett , now 73 , has been in business for more than 60 years .
we just look for a good business , run by sensible people at a good price warren buffett he started as a boy with a newspaper round in omaha and made so much money from it that he bought a parcel of agricultural land to rent to farmers .
before he had even started college , he had set up another business hiring out pin-ball machines to local barbers .
on the stage at the 2004 omaha meeting , he and his partner , charlie , dispensed wisdom which - once they 'd uttered it - seemed completely obvious .
it 's just not the way most of the rest of business sees or does things .
the whole course on which businesses to buy , for example , mr buffett said : " we just look for a good business , run by sensible people at a good price " .
there 's been an explosion in raw material prices charlie munger obvious enough , but it meant that berkshire hathaway shunned internet companies while everybody else waded in .
berkshire 's style is to acquire more solid , unglamorous companies which are fundamentally sound but undervalued and then strengthen them so a truer value is realised .
the point is to make the investment to keep the company .
" we look at investments like you look at an eighteen-hole golf course , " mr buffett said .
the idea is that you might perform better on some holes than others , but the whole course is the point - not getting out after a few good holes .
on the current economic situation , mr buffett said there 's clearly improvement .

solo pilot polly vacher wanted to be the first person to fly solo around the world via both poles in a single-engine aircraft the 60-year-old of drayton , oxfordshire , tells bbc news online how she lost out on her attempt to break the record - but gained some perspective .
the wind was blowing hard and my poor g-frgn , my little piper dakota , was struggling and my fuel disappearing fast .
i was so near yet so far from achieving that elusive goal of flying around the world single-handed via both the poles .
i had flown over the north pole and now i was trying to conquer the south pole .
i suddenly found myself making one of the hardest decisions in my life .
but was it that hard ?
what were the alternatives ?
running out of fuel and crash landing on the desolate ross ice shelf was a gloomy prospect .
i would almost definitely damage my aircraft .

solo pilot polly vacher wanted to be the first person to fly solo around the world via both poles in a single-engine aircraft the 60-year-old of drayton , oxfordshire , tells bbc news online how she lost out on her attempt to break the record - but gained some perspective .
the wind was blowing hard and my poor g-frgn , my little piper dakota , was struggling and my fuel disappearing fast .
i was so near yet so far from achieving that elusive goal of flying around the world single-handed via both the poles .
i had flown over the north pole and now i was trying to conquer the south pole .
i suddenly found myself making one of the hardest decisions in my life .
but was it that hard ?
what were the alternatives ?
running out of fuel and crash landing on the desolate ross ice shelf was a gloomy prospect .
i would almost definitely damage my aircraft .
i would probably injure or kill myself and i might injure or kill someone who came to rescue me .
this was not an option so i turned the plane around and returned to the antarctic peninsula .
when i finally saw the white cliffs of dover on a clear sunny day , the tears rolled down my cheeks .
polly vacher at first i was gutted , but it only took a few minutes for me to think about the flying scholarships for the disabled charity i was flying for .
each and every one of them has a physical disability and i thought that if i felt gutted how must they feel when for example they have had an accident and found themselves in a wheelchair for life ?
this very quickly put it all in the right perspective and i sat back and enjoyed a tailwind and the wonderful scenery i was so privileged to see .
after a day to recover from my disappointment , i was faced with the agonising problem of trying to arrange fuel to be shipped in for me to make a further attempt .
in the end this proved fruitless and so without enough fuel to cross the antarctic and with the weather showing no signs of improvement i knew my hopes of flying around the poles was over .
i had to try to put my disappointment behind me and concentrate on my other record attempt - to be the first person to fly around the world in a single engine aircraft landing on all seven continents .
polly vacher has set three new aviation records since i could n't go over the antarctic , i would have to find another way to fly to new zealand .
the only way was to fly back to california and across the pacific , island-hopping as i had done on my last flight .
this in itself was a daunting prospect .
i had to fly an extra 14,000 nautical miles which in the end took 133 flying hours in 29 days .
each day i flew an average seven to nine hours from new zealand right back to the uk via australia , the far east , the middle east , egypt and into europe .
on one occasion over brazil i opened the cockpit door and was hit by a blast of hot air and the temperature gauge registered 67c briefly before it broke with the strain .
' elation and tears ' the longest of flights took 16 hours as we ploughed our way across the pacific from california to hawaii , a distance of 2,068 nautical miles .
as i made my way back to the uk i reflected on the many people who i had met .
everywhere i went i was greeted with warmth and hospitality .
when i finally saw the white cliffs of dover on a clear sunny day , the tears rolled down my cheeks .
on being passed to the first british controller i was so choked that i could n't speak to him .
these were tears of joy , elation and tears of sheer emotion as i reached my beloved homeland after nearly a year of what had become the greatest challenge of my life , the most exciting challenge of my life , and the most satisfying and rewarding challenge one could ever want to experience .
polly vacher set three new records : first woman to fly solo in a single engine aircraft over the north pole .
the first woman to fly solo in a single engine aircraft in antarctica .
first person to fly around the world in a single engine aircraft landing on all seven continents .

the party took 21.6 % of the vote , with president megawati sukarnoputri 's pdi-p party coming second with 18.5 % , said the general election commission .
the result is a setback for the pdi-p , which won over a third of votes in 1999 in the first poll after the overthrow of suharto 's 32-year dictatorship .
analysts said mrs megawati 's re-election bid in july could be damaged .
the bbc 's jakarta correspondent says the results reflect a deep disappointment felt by many towards mrs megawati 's government and the difficulty she now faces in trying to hold onto her job .
the frontrunner at this early stage is susilo bambang yudhoyono , who stepped down as security minister in march .
his personal popularity led his relatively new democrat party to fifth place in the general election .
with no party claiming a majority in the 550-member national assembly , indonesia will continue with a coalition government after a new president is elected .
pdi-p had been the most powerful party in the current ruling coalition .
election results golkar party - 21 . % pdi-p party - 18.5 % national awakening party - 10.5 % united development party - 8.15 % democrat party - 7.45 % in pictures : election day packed election year in the 1999 elections , pdi-p took 33.7 % of the vote and golkar 22.5 % .
many voters are believed to have turned against president megawati 's party because of the perception that the leadership is aloof and has failed to keep promises to cut corruption and unemployment .
polling took place in early april but it has taken time for votes from outlying areas , in the world 's fourth most populous country , to be counted .
the election commission said turnout was 84 % , or 124.4 million voters , although almost 11 million votes were invalid .
one area of concern was the high number of invalid votes - almost 9 % of total ballots cast .
given the complexity of the election process , our correspondent says it was perhaps not surprising that some voters failed to fill out their papers correctly .
but overall , this election , conducted peacefully and supported by the vast majority of registered voters , was a significant consolidation of indonesia 's democratic credentials , our correspondent says .

according to rbs , merging charter one into citizens will make the resulting bank one of the 10 biggest in the us , with assets of almost $ 130bn and 24,000 employees in 13 states .
charter one has 616 branches in the northeast and midwest , and also an extensive portfolio of financial businesses including auto finance and commercial leasing .
until now citizens ' presence has been restricted to seven states in the north-eastern us : five states in new england as well as new jersey and pennsylvania .
rbs chief executive fred goodwin said " this is a highly logical and natural acquisition for citizens to make ... it consolidates citizens position as one of the leading banks in the us " .
rbs hopes to get one quarter of its future profits from its us operations .
us growth the expansion is only the latest in a constant stream of us acquisitions - 26 since citizens was bought by rbs in 1988 .
the most recent was the credit card arm of people 's bank in connecticut for $ 360m in february .
the largest until now was the retail branch network of mellon financial corp for $ 2.2bn in 2001 .
charter one 's shareholders are to receive $ 44.50 a share when the deal closes towards the end of this year .
the deal is to be financed with new shares worth about £ 2.5bn.
the us retail banking system has seen a wave of consolidation since the us congress deregulated the banking sector in the late l990s .
in the most recent move , bank of america paid $ 44bn to buy fleetboston financial .

pre-tax profits sank to £ 60.7m -lrb- $ 108.6m -rrb- for the year to 28 february , compared with £ 117.4m last year .
matalan has been hit by sliding sales , following problems with its womenswear range last summer , and increased competition from supermarkets .
but the firm said recent trading had improved , with like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to 1 may up 3.1 % .
" last year was a difficult one for matalan , and the results produced by the group are deeply disappointing , " said chairman john hargreaves .
" however , i believe that the building blocks for a recovery are in place , " he added .
price pressure the profit figure was at the low end of expectations , despite matalan having already issued two profit warnings either side of the christmas trading period .
the firm said trading in november , in the build-up to the crucial festive period , was " affected by significant discounting on the high street " .
earlier in the year , summer sales of its womenswear range were hit by " poor choice , weak marketing and a ... range that failed to meet the needs of our core customer , " matalan said .
like-for-like sales at matalan retail were down 6.5 % .
however , the firm said there were signs of recovery , with trading since the beginning of the new financial year " satisfactory " .
it said it was " pleased with the progress we have made in ladieswear , kidswear and home , but menswear remains disappointing " .
decline matalan was one of the big retail success stories of the late 1990s , but in recent years it has fallen out of favour .
as well as problems with its clothing ranges the firm has also been hit by boardroom clashes .
chief executive paul mason stepped down unexpectedly in march last year following disagreements with other senior managers .
matalan shares peaked at 800p in late 2000 .
on wednesday morning the shares were trading at 172.5p , up 0.5p on the day .
