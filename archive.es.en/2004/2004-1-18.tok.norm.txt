calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .

premiers from several german states said they support introducing a mandatory public service year as proposals to end the draft would also do away with civilian national service the health sector has come to rely on . across party lines , political leaders on sunday suggested to consider a social year for men and women .
“ i think this warrants consideration as it would strengthen a sense of community and societal responsibility , ” peer steinbrück , the social democratic premier of germany ’ s most populous state , north-rhine-westphalia , told bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang böhmer wolfgang böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who serves as premier of saxony-anhalt in eastern germany , agreed .
“ i am in favor of a social year as it is an instrument to equally spread the burden within a generation , ” böhmer , a christian democrat , said . so far , only a percentage of young men have to join the military for nine months or work in the health care or social sector instead .
about 90,000 germans decide to do community service each year . ending draft would deal blow to health sector many hospitals and senior citizens ’ homes depend on these young men , who receive salaries far below those of professional workers .
charitable organizations have already expressed fears that abolishing the draft would have “ catastrophic ” consequences in the social sector . some services , such as going for walks with or reading to old people and doing office work might have to be abolished completely , joachim kendelbacher from the workers ’ welfare organization , which employs about 6,000 national service people , recently told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military recruits .
while german defense minister peter struck has so far opposed ending the draft , a phase-out of the system by 2008 is becoming more and more likely : last week , berlin ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens announced that it would seriously consider abolishing the draft . “ i think it would be great if the government could come to a decision this year , ” greens leader reinhard bütikofer told bild am sonntag . constitution prohibits mandatory service year so far according to a survey by bild am sonntag and rtl television , 70 percent of germans would support a compulsory social year , with only 27 percent opposing the idea .
among people aged 30 or younger , 61 percent said they were in favor of introducing a mandatory public service . but supporters of a compulsory social year still have to deal with germany ’ s constitution , which forbids replacing conscription with another kind of mandatory service . north-rhine-westphalia ’ s peer steinbrück therefore cautioned that the legal possibilities to introduce a year of social service would have to be checked first .
“ in any case , the -lrb- current -rrb- national service should not be abolished without some kind of replacement , ” steinbrück said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution .

15 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .

kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .
dresden flourished into one of germany 's most beautiful baroque royal seats during the 1700s , and the buildings that date from the reign of augustus the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- remain its pride and joy .
augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's zwinger palace the reconstruction and restoration work to restore dresden to its former glory began in 1951 , and some of it continues to this day .
modern dresden - the 500,000-strong capital of the eastern german state of saxony - has risen up from the ruins of the city ’ s past .

zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .
more than 150 of the zwinger art treasures failed to survive the bombing raids of 1945 .
frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- the frauenkirche , once germany 's most important protestant church , dominates the neumarkt .
largely destroyed in 1945 , the church lay in ruins for decades as a memorial to the victims of that fateful night .

there is an open air theater and , for the kids , a puppet theater .
serious nature lovers can also hang out on the meadows along the elbe on the outskirts of the city , or cycle through the dresden heath , a large area of parkland located to the northeast .

dresden ’ s geographical position behind the saxon hills meant its residents could not pick up western television or radio broadcasts in gdr days .
this earned it the label tal der ahnungslosen , or valley of the clueless .

augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .

highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .
dresden flourished into one of germany 's most beautiful baroque royal seats during the 1700s , and the buildings that date from the reign of augustus the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- remain its pride and joy .
augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's zwinger palace the reconstruction and restoration work to restore dresden to its former glory began in 1951 , and some of it continues to this day .
modern dresden - the 500,000-strong capital of the eastern german state of saxony - has risen up from the ruins of the city ’ s past .
the best way to take in the sights and sounds of dresden is on foot .
start by walking a full circle from the main railway station into the altstadt -lrb- old town -rrb- , crossing the river elbe over the albertbrücke -lrb- albert bridge -rrb- , passing albertplatz -lrb- albert square -rrb- and returning via the augustusbrücke -lrb- augustus bridge -rrb- .
on the way , take in the famous semper opera house and zwinger museum , the theaterplatz and the renaissance palace , the albertinum gallery with its green vault housing a collection of augustus ’ jewels , and the new and old market squares .
zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .
more than 150 of the zwinger art treasures failed to survive the bombing raids of 1945 .
frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- the frauenkirche , once germany 's most important protestant church , dominates the neumarkt .
largely destroyed in 1945 , the church lay in ruins for decades as a memorial to the victims of that fateful night .

there is an open air theater and , for the kids , a puppet theater .
serious nature lovers can also hang out on the meadows along the elbe on the outskirts of the city , or cycle through the dresden heath , a large area of parkland located to the northeast .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .
dresden flourished into one of germany 's most beautiful baroque royal seats during the 1700s , and the buildings that date from the reign of augustus the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- remain its pride and joy .
augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's zwinger palace the reconstruction and restoration work to restore dresden to its former glory began in 1951 , and some of it continues to this day .
modern dresden - the 500,000-strong capital of the eastern german state of saxony - has risen up from the ruins of the city ’ s past .
the best way to take in the sights and sounds of dresden is on foot .
start by walking a full circle from the main railway station into the altstadt -lrb- old town -rrb- , crossing the river elbe over the albertbrücke -lrb- albert bridge -rrb- , passing albertplatz -lrb- albert square -rrb- and returning via the augustusbrücke -lrb- augustus bridge -rrb- .
on the way , take in the famous semper opera house and zwinger museum , the theaterplatz and the renaissance palace , the albertinum gallery with its green vault housing a collection of augustus ’ jewels , and the new and old market squares .
zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .
more than 150 of the zwinger art treasures failed to survive the bombing raids of 1945 .
frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- the frauenkirche , once germany 's most important protestant church , dominates the neumarkt .
largely destroyed in 1945 , the church lay in ruins for decades as a memorial to the victims of that fateful night .
restoration work began in 1990 , and was completed in 2006 .

there is an open air theater and , for the kids , a puppet theater .
serious nature lovers can also hang out on the meadows along the elbe on the outskirts of the city , or cycle through the dresden heath , a large area of parkland located to the northeast .

and don ’ t leave without trying another of the city ’ s famous exports , the stollen - a sweet , sugar-dusted loaf packed with dried fruit and spices .
dresden ’ s geographical position behind the saxon hills meant its residents could not pick up western television or radio broadcasts in gdr days .
this earned it the label tal der ahnungslosen , or valley of the clueless .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .

there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .

zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .
more than 150 of the zwinger art treasures failed to survive the bombing raids of 1945 .
frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- the frauenkirche , once germany 's most important protestant church , dominates the neumarkt .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .
dresden flourished into one of germany 's most beautiful baroque royal seats during the 1700s , and the buildings that date from the reign of augustus the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- remain its pride and joy .
augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .

modern dresden - the 500,000-strong capital of the eastern german state of saxony - has risen up from the ruins of the city ’ s past .
the best way to take in the sights and sounds of dresden is on foot .
start by walking a full circle from the main railway station into the altstadt -lrb- old town -rrb- , crossing the river elbe over the albertbrücke -lrb- albert bridge -rrb- , passing albertplatz -lrb- albert square -rrb- and returning via the augustusbrücke -lrb- augustus bridge -rrb- .

zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend the talks , which will take place at the end of january . israel demands removal of installation while the swedish foreign ministry plans to call in mazel early next week to voice a formal protest against the vandalism , israel will not participate in the conference unless the installation is removed from the exhibition , according to the ministry .
kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .
relatives of victims of terrorist attacks in israel called on the government to revoke feiler ’ s citizenship , according to dpa news service . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism talks to go ahead a bitter row between jewish leaders and the european commission seems to have been resolved , reopening the path for high level talks on anti-semitism in europe .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend the talks , which will take place at the end of january . israel demands removal of installation while the swedish foreign ministry plans to call in mazel early next week to voice a formal protest against the vandalism , israel will not participate in the conference unless the installation is removed from the exhibition , according to the ministry .
kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .
relatives of victims of terrorist attacks in israel called on the government to revoke feiler ’ s citizenship , according to dpa news service . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism talks to go ahead a bitter row between jewish leaders and the european commission seems to have been resolved , reopening the path for high level talks on anti-semitism in europe .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend the talks , which will take place at the end of january . israel demands removal of installation while the swedish foreign ministry plans to call in mazel early next week to voice a formal protest against the vandalism , israel will not participate in the conference unless the installation is removed from the exhibition , according to the ministry .
kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .

premiers from several german states said they support introducing a mandatory public service year as proposals to end the draft would also do away with civilian national service the health sector has come to rely on . across party lines , political leaders on sunday suggested to consider a social year for men and women .
“ i think this warrants consideration as it would strengthen a sense of community and societal responsibility , ” peer steinbrück , the social democratic premier of germany ’ s most populous state , north-rhine-westphalia , told bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang böhmer wolfgang böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who serves as premier of saxony-anhalt in eastern germany , agreed .
“ i am in favor of a social year as it is an instrument to equally spread the burden within a generation , ” böhmer , a christian democrat , said . so far , only a percentage of young men have to join the military for nine months or work in the health care or social sector instead .
about 90,000 germans decide to do community service each year . ending draft would deal blow to health sector many hospitals and senior citizens ’ homes depend on these young men , who receive salaries far below those of professional workers .
charitable organizations have already expressed fears that abolishing the draft would have “ catastrophic ” consequences in the social sector . some services , such as going for walks with or reading to old people and doing office work might have to be abolished completely , joachim kendelbacher from the workers ’ welfare organization , which employs about 6,000 national service people , recently told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military recruits .
while german defense minister peter struck has so far opposed ending the draft , a phase-out of the system by 2008 is becoming more and more likely : last week , berlin ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens announced that it would seriously consider abolishing the draft . “ i think it would be great if the government could come to a decision this year , ” greens leader reinhard bütikofer told bild am sonntag . constitution prohibits mandatory service year so far according to a survey by bild am sonntag and rtl television , 70 percent of germans would support a compulsory social year , with only 27 percent opposing the idea .
among people aged 30 or younger , 61 percent said they were in favor of introducing a mandatory public service . but supporters of a compulsory social year still have to deal with germany ’ s constitution , which forbids replacing conscription with another kind of mandatory service . north-rhine-westphalia ’ s peer steinbrück therefore cautioned that the legal possibilities to introduce a year of social service would have to be checked first .

“ i think this warrants consideration as it would strengthen a sense of community and societal responsibility , ” peer steinbrück , the social democratic premier of germany ’ s most populous state , north-rhine-westphalia , told bild am sonntag newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang böhmer wolfgang böhmer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who serves as premier of saxony-anhalt in eastern germany , agreed .
“ i am in favor of a social year as it is an instrument to equally spread the burden within a generation , ” böhmer , a christian democrat , said . so far , only a percentage of young men have to join the military for nine months or work in the health care or social sector instead .
about 90,000 germans decide to do community service each year . ending draft would deal blow to health sector many hospitals and senior citizens ’ homes depend on these young men , who receive salaries far below those of professional workers .
charitable organizations have already expressed fears that abolishing the draft would have “ catastrophic ” consequences in the social sector . some services , such as going for walks with or reading to old people and doing office work might have to be abolished completely , joachim kendelbacher from the workers ’ welfare organization , which employs about 6,000 national service people , recently told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military recruits .
while german defense minister peter struck has so far opposed ending the draft , a phase-out of the system by 2008 is becoming more and more likely : last week , berlin ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens announced that it would seriously consider abolishing the draft . “ i think it would be great if the government could come to a decision this year , ” greens leader reinhard bütikofer told bild am sonntag . constitution prohibits mandatory service year so far according to a survey by bild am sonntag and rtl television , 70 percent of germans would support a compulsory social year , with only 27 percent opposing the idea .
among people aged 30 or younger , 61 percent said they were in favor of introducing a mandatory public service . but supporters of a compulsory social year still have to deal with germany ’ s constitution , which forbids replacing conscription with another kind of mandatory service . north-rhine-westphalia ’ s peer steinbrück therefore cautioned that the legal possibilities to introduce a year of social service would have to be checked first .
“ in any case , the -lrb- current -rrb- national service should not be abolished without some kind of replacement , ” steinbrück said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .

kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend the talks , which will take place at the end of january . israel demands removal of installation while the swedish foreign ministry plans to call in mazel early next week to voice a formal protest against the vandalism , israel will not participate in the conference unless the installation is removed from the exhibition , according to the ministry .
kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .

calling it an “ act against growing anti-semitism , ” israeli premier ariel sharon on sunday thanked his country 's ambassador to sweden for wrecking a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white . according to news reports , israeli ambassador zvi mazel had turned off several spot lights around the installation , which is entitled " snow white and the madness of truth " and includes the picture of the terrorist on a boat that floats in a pool filled with red water .
trying to submerge the boat , he also threw one spot light in the basin , shouting that the work was glorifying murder and endorsing further terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zvi mazel in an archive photo .
“ my whole body was shaking when i saw the assassin depicted as snow white , ” mazel -lrb- photo -rrb- later told reporters , adding that he had planned the vandalism as an act of protest and would repeat it if necessary . artist denies anti-semitic motivation the work ’ s creator , dror feiler , an israel-born artist who emigrated to sweden in the 1970s , rejected accusations that he wanted to endorse terrorist attacks .
mazel had completely misunderstood the aim of the project , he said . “ every rational person should have been able to see that we wanted to express the pain over the blood-letting on both sides , ” said feiler , who belongs to an organization called “ jews for israeli-palestinian peace . ”
he added that a plate next to the installation stated that the woman , hanadi jaradat , had killed 21 innocent people when she set off a bomb at a restaurant in haifa last october . the installation , which has already been restored , forms part of an exhibition in the historical museum in sweden ’ s capital stockholm .
the show has been set up in connection with a planned international conference on the prevention of genocide .
un secretary general kofi annan is expected to attend the talks , which will take place at the end of january . israel demands removal of installation while the swedish foreign ministry plans to call in mazel early next week to voice a formal protest against the vandalism , israel will not participate in the conference unless the installation is removed from the exhibition , according to the ministry .
kristian berg , the museum ’ s director , categorically refused to do this and instead invited mazel to participate in a public debate about his action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon israel ’ s leader meanwhile expressed his support for the diplomat ’ s behavior .
“ i thanked him for standing up against a growing anti-semitism , ” sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- said after speaking to mazel via telephone , adding that his country will intensify its fight against such sentiments .
the israeli foreign ministry has also summoned sweden 's ambassador for talks about the incident . most israeli newspapers also endorsed the vandalism , saying that mazel had acted in the name of all of his countrymen .
relatives of victims of terrorist attacks in israel called on the government to revoke feiler ’ s citizenship , according to dpa news service . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-semitism talks to go ahead a bitter row between jewish leaders and the european commission seems to have been resolved , reopening the path for high level talks on anti-semitism in europe .

even prior to 1945 , dresden was no stranger to destruction .
in 1685 , a terrible fire consumed much of the city and led to a large-scale rebuilding project .
dresden flourished into one of germany 's most beautiful baroque royal seats during the 1700s , and the buildings that date from the reign of augustus the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- remain its pride and joy .
augustus ’ successor , augustus iii , continued developing dresden , but lost to prussia during the seven years war -lrb- 1756-1763 -rrb- , when much of the town was destroyed by frederick the great .
at the start of the 19th century , dresden became the focal point of germany 's romantic period , with none other than johann wolfgang von goethe exclaiming : " dresden gave me great pleasure , and my desire to think about art was revived .
there are unbelievable treasures of all kinds at this beautiful place . "
the bombing of dresden the 20th century had a crueler fate in store for dresden .
on the night of february 13th , 1945 , us and british warplanes launched a deadly attack on the city , dropping some 3,300 tons of ordnance in three bombing waves .
at least 35,000 people were killed in the resulting firestorms , many of them refugees from the eastern front .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's zwinger palace the reconstruction and restoration work to restore dresden to its former glory began in 1951 , and some of it continues to this day .
modern dresden - the 500,000-strong capital of the eastern german state of saxony - has risen up from the ruins of the city ’ s past .
the best way to take in the sights and sounds of dresden is on foot .
start by walking a full circle from the main railway station into the altstadt -lrb- old town -rrb- , crossing the river elbe over the albertbrücke -lrb- albert bridge -rrb- , passing albertplatz -lrb- albert square -rrb- and returning via the augustusbrücke -lrb- augustus bridge -rrb- .
on the way , take in the famous semper opera house and zwinger museum , the theaterplatz and the renaissance palace , the albertinum gallery with its green vault housing a collection of augustus ’ jewels , and the new and old market squares .
zwinger museum the zwinger museum is dresden 's most famous building , and one of the most important late-baroque buildings in all of europe .
dating from the early 18th century , it now houses impressive collections of porcelain from nearby meissen , weapons , clocks , scientific equipment and old paintings .
highlights of the collection include works by rubens , rembrandt , raffaello and titian .
hundreds of paintings were looted by the soviets after the end of world war ii , and although some have been returned , many more have yet to be traced .
more than 150 of the zwinger art treasures failed to survive the bombing raids of 1945 .
frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- the frauenkirche , once germany 's most important protestant church , dominates the neumarkt .
largely destroyed in 1945 , the church lay in ruins for decades as a memorial to the victims of that fateful night .
restoration work began in 1990 , and was completed in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a santa claus with dresden 's famous christmas cake in fair weather , any visit to dresden should include a stroll in the town 's largest park , situated to the southeast of the old town - the grosser garten , with its zoo and botanical gardens .
there is an open air theater and , for the kids , a puppet theater .
serious nature lovers can also hang out on the meadows along the elbe on the outskirts of the city , or cycle through the dresden heath , a large area of parkland located to the northeast .
oldest christmas market in december , don ’ t miss the striezelmarkt , germany 's oldest christmas market , founded in 1434 .
named after the savory pretzel -lrb- consumed by everyone here , it seems -rrb- , the striezelmarkt is one of the most vibrant and colorful events in the dresden calendar .
and don ’ t leave without trying another of the city ’ s famous exports , the stollen - a sweet , sugar-dusted loaf packed with dried fruit and spices .
dresden ’ s geographical position behind the saxon hills meant its residents could not pick up western television or radio broadcasts in gdr days .
this earned it the label tal der ahnungslosen , or valley of the clueless .

ms menchu , a human rights activist , was offered the " goodwill ambassador " role by new president oscar berger .
mr berger came to power promising to crack down on corruption and rights abuses and said he wanted include more indigenous people in his government .
guatemala 's united nations-brokered peace accords were signed in 1996 .
the accords ended 36 years of civil war between a series of military regimes and anti-government guerrillas which left up to 200,000 people dead .
noting that it would be the first time she had been directly invited to work with the guatemalan government , ms menchu was quoted by the associated press news agency as saying she would " like to play this role and offer to guatemala all the contacts of friendship that many communities have given me " .
ms menchu , a campaigner for the rights of indigenous mayan population , won the nobel peace prize in 1992 .
' respect and equality ' mr berger , a conservative former mayor of guatemala city , was sworn in as president last wednesday .
the new president said in his inaugural speech he would adhere strictly to the 1996 peace accords which ended the war .
" we ca n't talk about unity without promoting the peace accords , " he said .
" this task will be fundamental for this government , the way to ensure respect for human rights and equality for everyone . "
mr berger also used the speech to promise a job creation programme driven by private investment , along with pledges to stamp out corruption .
however analysts observe that he did not address the issue of genocide charges against ex-dictator efrain rios montt , whom he defeated at the polls .
mr rios montt , 77 , is set to lose his immunity from prosecution this wednesday , when his term as speaker of the guatemalan parliament expires .

hundreds of hdtvs drew the crowds at the ces in 1930 , the baird televisor went on sale for £ 18 as a rare , but fully-fledged consumer product .
but in 2004 , there are now more tvs than you can shake a remote at , as demonstrated at last week 's consumer electronic show -lrb- ces -rrb- in las vegas .
most of those on show were no ordinary sets though , they were high-definition .
" high-definition television -lrb- hdtv -rrb- is a widescreen , high-resolution format that has five times more information on the screen than conventional television , " explained john taylor , vice president of public affairs at lg electronics .
" combine that with dolby digital sound you have that ultimate home cinema experience . "
big projections traditional analogue tv is a far from perfect technology .
hdtv gives viewers a stunning and convincing quality .
the hundreds of new , flat panels on display at the ces attracted a great deal of attention , particularly those from the sony camp .

sony is not alone , of course .
lg electronics unveiled what it said was the biggest plasma flat screen in the world .
it is a giant 76-inch display that is just 3.5 inches deep , which will be on sale by the end of the year at a rumoured - and equally massive - $ 35,000 -lrb- £ 19,200 -rrb- .
but potential hdtv customers are not just faced with a choice of four formats .
those in the industry admit there is a great deal of confusion amongst consumers , and say hdtv equipment is often bought with little understanding of its true capabilities , as bill casamo , executive vice president of voom , explained .
" half the people in the us that have bought a hdtv set have no ability to receive hd , they have no receiver to receive it , " he said .
" so they use it as a playback device for dvds , which is not high definition . "
the us government has tried to make the hdtv situation a little easier by telling manufacturers they now have to build digital tuners into many of the tv sets .
previously it was a separate purchase , but this does add to the already-high price tag .
stop gap devices like roku 's hd1000 have tried to fill the gap for those who have bought a hdtv with no tuner , and who are in search of a true hi-definition experience .
the company sells multimedia collections on memory cards , including famous artwork , samples of high definition video and original animation .
roku 's ceo , anthony wood , hopes it will give consumers around the world a taste of the real thing .
the lack of hd content is slowing hdtv adoption " one of the biggest problems of hdtv today is that there is not a lot of content that is available in hdtv , and i think that 's a problem worldwide , " he said .
it has been embraced more readily by the us and japan , but there are many places on the planet where interest is minimal , perhaps due to the small amount of content available .
hollywood is also yet to fully embrace the idea of supplying high quality imagery to the globe until piracy issues have been addressed , according to the consumer electronics association 's jeff joseph .
" copy protection is probably the last critical remaining roadblock on the road to hdtv , " he said .
" we need to find a balance between the legitimate concerns of the content providers who want to protect intellectual property - it is critical to respect copyrights .
" but at the same time , we have to respect and honour the fundamental home recording rights of the consumers . "

but potential hdtv customers are not just faced with a choice of four formats .
those in the industry admit there is a great deal of confusion amongst consumers , and say hdtv equipment is often bought with little understanding of its true capabilities , as bill casamo , executive vice president of voom , explained .
" half the people in the us that have bought a hdtv set have no ability to receive hd , they have no receiver to receive it , " he said .
" so they use it as a playback device for dvds , which is not high definition . "
the us government has tried to make the hdtv situation a little easier by telling manufacturers they now have to build digital tuners into many of the tv sets .
previously it was a separate purchase , but this does add to the already-high price tag .
stop gap devices like roku 's hd1000 have tried to fill the gap for those who have bought a hdtv with no tuner , and who are in search of a true hi-definition experience .
the company sells multimedia collections on memory cards , including famous artwork , samples of high definition video and original animation .
roku 's ceo , anthony wood , hopes it will give consumers around the world a taste of the real thing .
the lack of hd content is slowing hdtv adoption " one of the biggest problems of hdtv today is that there is not a lot of content that is available in hdtv , and i think that 's a problem worldwide , " he said .
it has been embraced more readily by the us and japan , but there are many places on the planet where interest is minimal , perhaps due to the small amount of content available .

the government is expected to make an announcement soon on its public consultation on donor anonymity .
some fertility experts fear it will include new legislation allowing children of sperm donation to trace their biological fathers .
they warn the move could scare off potential donors when there is already a shortage .
around 1,000 children are born in the uk every year from artificial insemination .
the sperm donors , three quarters of which are students , remain anonymous .
it would deny a patient the basic right to having treatment for sperm donation on an anonymous basis dr paul serhal sperm donor says ' i 'd happily be identified ' dr paul serhal , of university college london , said the lifting of that anonymity could deter donors .
he told bbc radio five live : " this would certainly impact on the number of potential sperm donors and would also deny a patient the basic right to having treatment for sperm donation on an anonymous basis . "
he also said it may push patients seeking sperm donation to go abroad " where the guidelines for screening may not be as rigorous as here " .
while dr serhal believed in the basic right of children to know the identity of their father , he said it was also important to consider the right of the would-be parent to choose whether to tell their children about sperm donation .
swedish experience he advocated a two-tier system , where donors can choose to reveal their identity or remain anonymous .
in sweden , the onus is on the parents to tell their children they were conceived from sperm donation .

those supporting the change in the law say many children suffer from never knowing the identity of their fathers .

the vote will take place on 27 january at westminster that is despite the fact that there are no plans for tuition fees to be introduced in scotland and english mps can not vote on issues affecting scottish education .
conservative leader michael howard has described the situation as a " constitutional outrage " .
he has already urged scottish mps not to vote when the government 's proposals for student finance are debated in the house of commons on 27 january .
in a bbc interview during his first visit to scotland as tory leader , mr howard said : " we are adopting a position of principle in relation to this vote .
backbenchers " our member of parliament from scotland will not vote in it , and i challenge the other parties to adopt a similar position , so that their members of parliament from scotland do not vote and we do n't have top up fees imposed on england and wales by the votes of members of parliament from scotland , where top up fees will not be introduced . "
but the bbc survey suggests mr howard 's call has had no effect .
researchers for bbc radio scotland and bbc radio five live contacted every labour backbencher and opposition mp in scotland .
students have demonstrated against tuition fees sixty members of parliament were asked to take part in the survey and a total of 57 responded .
just one reported that he would not be voting on principle .
that mp was peter duncan - scotland 's only conservative mp .
the survey also gives an insight into the scale of labour 's backbench rebellion in scotland .
only seven scottish labour mps said they would definitely be voting against the government when its policy is put to the test in just over a week 's time .
the decision by an overwhelming majority of scottish mps to take part in the house of commons vote on tuition fees appears unlikely to win support from the scottish electorate .
school leavers a recent nfo system three survey for the herald newspaper showed most scots believe scottish mps should be banned from voting on english-only legislation at westminster .
however , many scottish mps argue they are duty bound to vote on the proposals for student finance south of the border .
they say the introduction of tuition fees at english universities will have a major impact on scottish school leavers who choose to study in england .
there is also concern that the proposals will allow english universities to lure top academics away from rival institutions in scotland due to the funding gap which the introduction of tuition fees could create .
