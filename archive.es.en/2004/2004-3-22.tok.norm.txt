german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .

the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .

the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .

dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .

" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .

social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .

" european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .
-lrb- february 7 , 2004 -rrb- eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .

" we are agreed that it should once again be a european , " he said at a news conference during a visit with french finance minister francis mer .
the job of leading the imf is traditionally held by a european while the top job at the world bank , the imf 's sister institution , goes to an american .
however , the united states can use its voting power to block any candidate deemed unsuitable by the white house .
european finance ministries have been busy speculating as to who could take over while imf directors representing asia , africa , latin america , the middle east , australia , switzerland and russia have proposed ending the european monopoly on the job by demanding that the new candidate be chosen " irrespective of nationality . "
köhler is stepping down after four years in the job to stand as a candidate for the german presidency . dw-world.de new german to head imf unlikely berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2004 -pipe- 20:00 utc eu to forge own policy on middle east although the european union and the united states have repeatedly stressed their united efforts to bring peace to the troubled middle east , brussels is now on the verge of adopting its own distinctly european approach .
according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .
the eu is expected to finalize its policy at june ’ s meeting of eu leaders . dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .
the eu is expected to finalize its policy at june ’ s meeting of eu leaders . dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .
the eu is expected to finalize its policy at june ’ s meeting of eu leaders . dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .
in a gesture towards washington , which has only warmly greeted europe 's efforts to crack down on terrorism , the ministers agreed to push forward plans to introduce biometric data in passports by 2006 , instead of the initially scheduled 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers call for anti-terror czar following madrid attacks europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement .

but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig georg braun , german chamber of commerce president .
but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.03.2004 eu condemns assassination of hamas leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yassin was killed in an israeli rocket attack in gaza .
meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .
-lrb- february 7 , 2004 -rrb- eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .
feedback do you think israel was right to kill yassin or will it merely cause more violence ?

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.03.2004 eu condemns assassination of hamas leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yassin was killed in an israeli rocket attack in gaza .
meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .
-lrb- february 7 , 2004 -rrb- eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .
-lrb- february 7 , 2004 -rrb- eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .

but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .
but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .

the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement .

an internal policy document obtained by the euobserver.com lists eleven policy objectives which may be included in an overall eu strategy for the region .
one of the possible objectives states : " the eu will promote wto membership for countries in the region . "
the goal is part of an overarching policy on the middle east formulated by the irish presidency , which currently holds the rotating head of the bloc .
the move would see countries such as algeria , lebanon , saudi arabia , yemen , iraq , libya , iran and syria become full-fledged members of the international trading body .
in addition to the membership , the eu also aims at improving business ties , modernizing the trade infrastructure and regulatory environment in the region as well as liberalizing the import and export markets .
the move would help to bring more isolated countries like iran and libya further into the international community .
in return , the eu would seek help creating a region of peace and stability including democratic and human rights reforms . dw-world.de eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .

investment bank lazards , which is handling the auction of the newspaper , has set a deadline of march 23 for all offers to be in .
the german company had already made its advances known before christmas but cooled on the deal as the competition heated up .
axel springer considered buying british tabloid the daily mirror five years ago and is believed to want to expand outside its own domestic market .
unlike the newspaper the germans have set their sights on , axel springer 's papers are pro-european and operate according to a guiding editorial principle to " further the unification of europe , " a political stance at odds with the euro-sceptic telegraph . more briefs 22.03.2004 -pipe- holsten faces delisting after carlsberg takeover 22.03.2004 -pipe- kpn to offer umts for german businesses 22.03.2004 -pipe- eu to consider cutting tobacco subsidies 19.03.2004 -pipe- german department store hit by spending low 19.03.2004 -pipe- bayer posts record loss 19.03.2004 -pipe- allianz avoids another year in the red 18.03.2004 -pipe- german bankruptcies on the rise 18.03.2004 -pipe- adidas to kit out athens olympic staff radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .

in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .

many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .

germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .

in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .

i 'm very disappointed , " museum director inna vollstaedt told reuters .
vollstaedt said the bank was worried about being associated with the nazis and wanted her out as soon as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2004 -pipe- 20:00 utc peta alters ' holocaust ' campaign in germany the animal rights organization peta has said it would change an advertising campaign in germany that compared the treatment of animals with the suffering of nazi holocaust victims .
one of the campaign posters that will no longer be shown juxtaposed images of emaciated concentration camp victims with lines of caged chickens .
peta 's change of heart came after germany 's jewish community won a lawsuit aimed at preventing the campaign , called " holocaust on your plate , " from being shown .
peta is displaying the exhibition across europe , and had planned to show the posters in stuttgart .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .
the eu is expected to finalize its policy at june ’ s meeting of eu leaders . dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.03.2004 eu condemns assassination of hamas leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yassin was killed in an israeli rocket attack in gaza .
meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .

many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .

germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig georg braun , german chamber of commerce president .
but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .
but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .
" that is globalization .
we have to finally get that through our heads , " he said .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .

they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .

in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .
in a gesture towards washington , which has only warmly greeted europe 's efforts to crack down on terrorism , the ministers agreed to push forward plans to introduce biometric data in passports by 2006 , instead of the initially scheduled 2007 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers call for anti-terror czar following madrid attacks europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig georg braun , german chamber of commerce president .
but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .
but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .
" that is globalization .

" we are agreed that it should once again be a european , " he said at a news conference during a visit with french finance minister francis mer .
the job of leading the imf is traditionally held by a european while the top job at the world bank , the imf 's sister institution , goes to an american .

european finance ministries have been busy speculating as to who could take over while imf directors representing asia , africa , latin america , the middle east , australia , switzerland and russia have proposed ending the european monopoly on the job by demanding that the new candidate be chosen " irrespective of nationality .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .
-lrb- february 7 , 2004 -rrb- eu to forge own policy on middle east despite calls for a common eu-us approach to the middle east , brussels will press ahead with its own " distinct approach , " according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.03.2004 german immigration talks to include security concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily now agrees security issues should be considered in the law .
german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .
" we should not lose our big opportunity to reach an agreement .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .

but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .
but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .
" that is globalization .
we have to finally get that through our heads , " he said .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.03.2004 german immigration talks to include security concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily now agrees security issues should be considered in the law .
german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .
" it has taken long enough and we have been talking about these issues long enough , " he said .

the president of germany 's chamber of commerce has advised german businesses to move production overseas to lower costs , prompting some politicians to call his remarks " unpatriotic . " a top german business leaders believes companies should move jobs to low-wage eastern european nations - not exactly the recommendation one might expect , with germany 's unemployment rate hovering around 11 percent .
but ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce , said just that in an interview monday with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
in the end , he said , such moves would help the german economy .
no time to wait " i recommend companies not wait for better government policies , but to take action now for themselves .
they should use the opportunities out there - for instance in europe 's eastward expansion , " braun told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .
on may 1 , ten more countries are set to join the european union , most of them relatively low-wage , former east-bloc nations .
the deadline 's approach has heightened debate over germany 's competitiveness in the global marketplace - and increased fears of further job losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig georg braun , german chamber of commerce president .
but rather than increasing the country 's economic woes , moving manufacturing to low-wage countries is " a recipe for securing jobs and training positions at home , " braun said .
a number of politicians denounced braun 's comments .
according to german government spokesman bela anda , chancellor gerhard schröder even called them " unpatriotic " on monday .
the new secretary-general of schröder 's social democratic party , klaus uwe benneter , also attacked braun 's position .
" whoever is part of leadership of the german economy and talks about germany as a business location in such a way is being indecent and irresponsible , " he said .
but in his interview , braun said the german government has a " basically faulty understanding business " and had failed to create the level of trust need to convince citizens that painful economic reforms were need to get the world 's third-largest economy back on its feet . he also said the profits of german-based business are overwhelmingly earned by their overseas operations , although this is n't always apparent in the balance sheets .
social system a drag ?
many argue that germany 's highly developed system of social benefits has acted as a drag on business expansion , hampering job creation and , as a result , spending .
braun said german politicians are to blame , for failing to adequately reform the social welfare system years ago .
in addition to regulatory difficulties , a lack of trained workers in the low-wage nations has kept yet more german businesses from moving their production abroad , braun said .
but while he admitted that germany has a surplus of trained workers , their mentality is n't necessarily business friendly . ' entrepreneurial spirit ' lacking " in germany , there is no real entrepreneurial spirit , " he told tagesspiegel .
germans are " too risk averse … and not only workers , but also businesses are risk averse . " " its not only the politicians who are weak , companies are weak as well , " he said .
braun warned that manufacturing jobs in many areas - especially those requiring on the job training - will continue to leave germany and go to the cheapest bidder .
" that is globalization .
we have to finally get that through our heads , " he said .

" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .

british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .

with the madrid bombings behind them and the fear of more attacks looming , european union foreign ministers on monday adopt tough new anti-terrorism measures ahead of a summit at the end of the week . the march 11 train attacks in madrid , which killed some 200 people in europe 's worst act of terror in over a decade , have rocketed terrorism to the top of the eu 's agenda , surpassing all talk of budgets and constitutions .
meeting in brussels on monday , foreign ministers for the 25 current and soon-to-be eu members made it clear the bloc aims to get tough on terror .
" it is vital to boost coordination , both within the eu and with third parties , " the foreign ministers agreed , confirming they had approved measures already debated by interior ministers in hastily-convened talks last friday .
tough talk but monday 's statements went beyond just rhetoric .
in an uncharacteristic move linking trade and aid with political compliance , the foreign ministers warned partner countries outside the bloc that their economic relations with the eu would suffer if they failed to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
the ministers referred to the fight against terror as " a key element of political dialogue " with non-eu countries , including those in the middle east , asia and africa .
those whose cooperation in fighting terrorism was deemed insufficient would risk loosing aid and trade with the economically powerful eu , the ministers wrote in a draft declaration on terrorism after the meeting .
to some extent , the europeans have already begun implementing the tough talk by suspending free-trade negotiations with iran until the government comes clean on its nuclear weapons program .
and an impending aid and trade deal with syria hinges on damascus accepting an anti-terrorism clause .
the new political strategy was just one in a list of measures to be presented to heads of government at a two-day summit on security starting this thursday .
no room to compromise in another move demonstrating brussels get-tough stance , the ministers adopted nato-style language committing all member states to provide military and other assistance to fellow eu countries that suffer a terrorist attack .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin justified the measures saying terrorism is " a menace that affects us all " and that there could be " no compromising .
we have to show solidarity . "
british foreign secretary jack straw said the ministers had set a june 30 deadline for all eu nations - current and soon-to-be - to enact a series of anti-terrorist laws .
" what we need is action .
the problem for the european union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest .
therefore , there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving , " straw said at a press conference after the meeting .
creating an anti-terror czar the foreign ministers also approved stronger financial measures to enable member states to freeze the assets of suspected terrorist groups in europe .
they seconded proposals put forth by interior ministers last friday , including the creation of a central authority to coordinate security strategy .
the creation of an eu anti-terror czar is seen as a step towards creating more cross-border exchanges of information to this end , the foreign ministers endorsed an initiative to enhance cooperation among police and intelligence services across the continent and to strengthen europol by expanding its field of responsibility to include an anti-terror department .

german interior minister otto schily has signaled he 's willing to include security measures in an immigration law as conservatives have demanded .
the debate on the legislation has heated up following the madrid attacks . for more than four years , the governing coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens has struggled to reach a compromise with the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the csu on sweeping new immigration legislation .
the new rules would help ensure the labor force has enough qualified workers as the german population shrinks in the coming decades . but following the attacks in madrid , the cdu further complicated the debate by making their final approval of the law contingent on the introduction of stronger measures to combat international terrorism .
hoping to wrap up negotiations before easter , schily has now signaled his willingness to cede to conservative demands , though he has yet to give any specifics . security a sticking point before sunday 's meeting of the special parliamentary working group designated with the task of hammering out a compromise , schily said that both sides were in " complete agreement " over the need for better security .
" no one can defend the admittance of a person to germany who has spent time in an al qaeda training camp , even if there 's no new evidence that he 's planning an attack , " he said . schily agreed that stronger measures should be put in place to combat terrorism , but did not indicate whether these would be added into the new immigration law or be presented in separate legislation .
schily is expected to give specifics on wednesday , when the group meets for another round of negotiations .
günther beckstein , the csu interior minister of bavaria , however , told a german radio program deutschlandfunk on monday that the issue should be addressed in the immigration law , because " that 's where it belongs " . after the terrorist bombings in madrid , the opposition christian democrats made their approval of the new immigration law contingent on the inclusion of stronger security measures .
they introduced their own brief on the topic with 27 proposals , including making it easier to deport foreigners who are merely suspected of participating in terrorist activities .
the legal aspects of such legislation may draw criticism from civil liberties activists . light at the end of the tunnel ? with schily 's willingness to near the conservative position on security concerns and other recent compromises , including an agreement on the immigration of skilled laborers and the right of return for ethnic germans from former east-block countries , an atmosphere of optimism has returned .
peter müller , the cdu saarland premier who is in the parliamentary working group , said he can " see the light at the end of the tunnel " . still , official guesses vary as to whether the long-running legislative saga will finally come to a close .
dieter wiefelspütz , an spd representative to the committee , said the chances of a compromise stood at about 75 to 80 percent , while beckstein said it was more likely - 55 percent more likely - that efforts to reach a final compromise would fail . the spd 's junior partner the greens could also torpedo the talks , if they feel their priorities are being sacrificed to appease the conservatives .
top greens negotiator volker beck has repeatedly said his party preferred no law to what greens considered a bad law . but schily told reporters it was time to put an end to the matter .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

" we are agreed that it should once again be a european , " he said at a news conference during a visit with french finance minister francis mer .

however , the united states can use its voting power to block any candidate deemed unsuitable by the white house .
european finance ministries have been busy speculating as to who could take over while imf directors representing asia , africa , latin america , the middle east , australia , switzerland and russia have proposed ending the european monopoly on the job by demanding that the new candidate be chosen " irrespective of nationality . "
köhler is stepping down after four years in the job to stand as a candidate for the german presidency . dw-world.de new german to head imf unlikely berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2004 -pipe- 20:00 utc eu to forge own policy on middle east although the european union and the united states have repeatedly stressed their united efforts to bring peace to the troubled middle east , brussels is now on the verge of adopting its own distinctly european approach .
according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .
chief among them is the creation of a " common zone of peace , prosperity and progress " .
the eu , however , is concerned that its own policies and what ’ s left of the arab-israeli peace process may be overtaken by a u.s. policy heavily focused on democratic reforms .
washington has proposed a series of joint declarations on reform of the middle east to take place at this summer ’ s eu-us , nato and g8 summits .
but brussels , faced with calls from the region for more consultation , is opting to " continue to pursue its own distinct strategy " .
in recent months the eu and u.s. have held a series of talks aimed at agreeing on a common approach .
they appear to have achieved few results on the most contentious issues , however .
the eu now says it will forge a " complimentary but distinct " approach , developing what it calls " a sense of shared ownership " of the plan .
" there is a view in the region that its perspectives have not been fully taken into account in the development of the current initiatives , " the document states .
diplomats say the outcome of the meeting of the arab league at the end of this month will be a major factor in determining the eu ’ s actions .
however , there is also some concern about the sidelining of the middle east peace process .
" progress on the resolution of the middle east conflict can not be a precondition for confronting the urgent reform challenges facing the countries in the region nor vice versa , " says the document .
" the lack of clear prospects for peace is already making it harder for reformers in the region to succeed " .
the eu is expected to finalize its policy at june ’ s meeting of eu leaders . dw-world.de fischer calls for new roadmap for mideast peace at an international security meeting in munich , germany calls for the creation of a new u.s. and european peace plan for the middle east as donald rumsfeld again explains washington ’ s justification for the iraq war .

meeting in brussels on monday , eu foreign ministers reacted to israel 's assassination of hamas spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin with sharp criticism , saying such actions only contribute to the cycle of violence . eu foreign ministers arrived in brussels for what was meant to be a meeting devoted to security issues after the terrorist attacks in madrid .
however , events in the middle east overshadowed the event : the israeli military assassinated the spiritual leader of hamas , the 67-year-old wheelchair bound cleric sheikh ahmed yassin , in a helicopter attack in gaza early monday morning . all of the ministers condemned the attack , saying it was against international law and such actions would do little to bring peace to the troubled region .
an official statement released by the eu appealed to both sides to exercise restraint . israel justified the killing by saying yassin was behind numerous terrorist bombings .
" the state of israel this morning hit the first and foremost leader of the palestinian terrorist murderers , " israeli prime minister ariel sharon said monday afternoon .
" i want to make clear the war on terrorism is not over and will continue daily everywhere . " israel undermines international law but the eu had hard harsh words for israel over the killing .
" this is very , very bad news for the peace process , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" this type of action does not contribute at all to create the conditions of peace . " in an unusually harsh condemnation , solana said although israel had the right to defend itself , its actions broke international law . " israel has no right to carry out extra-judicial killings , " he said in a statement endorsed by eu foreign ministers.yassin 's murder " inflamed the situation " and violence " is no substitute for the political negotiations which are necessary for a just and lasting settlement , " they said . jack straw , the british foreign secretary , was equally stern in his assessment .
" it is unacceptable , it is unjustified and it is unlikely to achieve its objective , " said straw .
meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed for calm .
" everything must be done so that further escalation can be avoided , " he said . but it was probably the polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz who hit the nail on the head when he bluntly stated , " i understand that israel is defending its own country , but the picture of a person in a wheelchair with a rocket ... this is no way to promote israel 's security . " european initiatives ? indeed , european leaders fears that the attack will plunge the region further into a cycle of violence are well founded .
hamas and al agsa martyrs brigade leaders have already warned of retaliatory attacks , saying " the gates of hell will be opened . "
such an escalation of hostilities on both sides does not bode well for european hopes to bring peace to the region through new initiatives . at the international security conference in munich in february , fischer hoped to breath news life into the peace process by proposing a new two-phase plan which called on europe , specifically through nato , to get more involved in the region . as the middle east plunges further into violence and the international community waits to see what kinds of retaliation the coming days will bring , it remains unclear what will become of of fischer 's proposals or the long-stalled u.s.-initiative , the " road map .

according to an internal policy paper obtained by the euobserver and drafted by the irish presidency , the eu has set 11 policy goals for greater engagement in the middle east .

a report for the scottish information commissioner found that 84 % of bodies were positive that they would meet the 1 january 2005 deadline .
however , commissioner kevin dunion said a " significant effort " must still be made to ensure compliance .
the majority of information must be made available under the legislation .
the study , carried out by craigforth consultancy research for the commissioner and the stationery office , found that 84 % of authorities surveyed were " very " or " fairly " confident of being in compliance .
a significant effort in staff training and records management still has to be made kevin dunion information commissioner eighty three per cent of staff believed it would have a positive impact on their organisation and an equal percentage said it would make public bodies more accountable .
however , 10 % said the new act would have a negative impact .
mr dunion said : " our research reflects a positive response by scottish authorities and confirms other indications that , so far , we are on track to implement the new legislation on the timetable set down .
electronic documents " however , a significant effort in staff training and records management still has to be made to ensure that from 1 january 2005 all requests for information , whether from the public , media , or business , receive a quick and full response . "
people can request every piece of information held by a public body , including paper and electronic documents , closed circuit television footage and maps .
exemptions exist in cases of national security or where law enforcement might be jeopardised but information can still be released if it is in the public interest .
the public have the right to appeal to the information commissioner if they are unsatisfied with a refusal .

several german papers comment on sunday 's election of franz muentefering to succeed chancellor gerhard schroeder as leader of the governing social democratic party , or spd .
the spd is far removed from finding its way - for the time being it is not making any progress berliner zeitung the berliner zeitung says mr muentefering will find it difficult to more than simply hold together a party riven by " self-doubt " over a series of unpopular social and economic reforms .
it describes the new chairman , who was elected by 95 per cent of delegates at the party meeting , as " a comrade , a mate , a real social democrat " .
however the spd " is far removed from finding its way - for the time being it is not making any progress , " the paper warns .
the sueddeutsche zeitung though believes chancellor gerhard schroeder 's speech at the party conference suggests it is too early to write the spd off .
" this is because schroeder , on the day he was voted out , delivered his best speech as party leader . "
it believes the chancellor 's decision to resign from the leadership was right because , " internal debates had increasingly been fought out as public wars " .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says the election result shows that the party is relieved to have a leader who seems to be close to the rank and file .
but it warns that franz muentefering is " not a political visionary " .
" he has n't made any programmatic contribution so far - this post is still vacant in the spd , " it says .
austria 's der standard comments on the new chairman 's age .
" the fact that with muentefering a 64-year old has become the person on whom hopes are pinned reveals the succession problems of a party which has failed to promote competent young politicians , " the paper says .
it adds that he stands for a different tone but no new ideas , and that time will tell whether voters would n't have preferred " a change in policy " .

jason steven dean , 31 , from wallasey , wirral is the 21st diver to be killed at the pool in the past decade .
mr dean went missing during a dive with four other people about 1130 gmt on saturday .
police divers using a remote underwater vehicle eventually found his body late on sunday afternoon .
the quarry lake - up to 300ft deep in places with a network of flooded tunnels and sheer drops - is a favourite training location for amateur divers from across the uk despite being notoriously dangerous .
one diver , rob higgie , said the pool will always be popular : " it is the best inland dive site in the country and possibly europe .
" it is obviously very deep for the technical divers , it is an excellent training ground , and an interesting place to dive . "
more than 20 divers have drowned in the pool in the nantlle valley in the last 10 years - six in the past year .
gwynedd councillor op hughes said that the safety of the site needs to be improved .
" i am very sad that we have to hear stories like this once again from dorothea , " he said .
" and we ask ourselves how many times will we hear these stories before something is done . "

mr dean went missing during a dive with four other people about 1130 gmt on saturday .
police divers using a remote underwater vehicle eventually found his body late on sunday afternoon .
the quarry lake - up to 300ft deep in places with a network of flooded tunnels and sheer drops - is a favourite training location for amateur divers from across the uk despite being notoriously dangerous .
one diver , rob higgie , said the pool will always be popular : " it is the best inland dive site in the country and possibly europe .
" it is obviously very deep for the technical divers , it is an excellent training ground , and an interesting place to dive . "
more than 20 divers have drowned in the pool in the nantlle valley in the last 10 years - six in the past year .
gwynedd councillor op hughes said that the safety of the site needs to be improved .
" i am very sad that we have to hear stories like this once again from dorothea , " he said .

as immigration controls in western countries become stricter , they resort to increasingly desperate methods to reach their " promised land " , and every year , an unknown number of people , probably in the tens of thousands , die in the attempt .
billy , 41 , from guinea , tells the extraordinary tale of how he crossed the sahara desert to reach morocco , where he smuggled himself into the spanish enclave of ceuta .
he is now working in italy , where he has been given a residence permit , and has just been back to see his family for the first time since he set out on his adventure more than four years ago .
it has always been my dream to go europe .
when i was a young boy , africans living in europe would visit us wearing their fancy clothes and flashing their money around .
we also knew some french people , who told us how wonderful france was and that father christmas lived there .
growing up in the fouta djalon region of guinea , life was extremely tough .
i had to walk 5km to and from school every day and then work in the fields for three or four hours .
i was told it would take a week to reach spain ...
little did i know how wrong that was when i was 22 , we moved to the senegalese capital , dakar , where i found work helping out in the main hospital .
i got some training and became a nurse .
i stayed there for 17 years and got a medal for my long service .
although i had a job , i could never look after my wife idiatou and my baby daughter as i would have wished on my meagre salary of $ 130 .
i wanted to have my own house and give my children the good start in life i never had .
going to europe seemed to be the best way to achieve these goals .
many of my friends had emigrated - i felt i was being left behind .
stranded i had heard that travelling overland was much cheaper than flying - and you did n't need a visa .
i was also told it would take a week to reach spain .
little did i know how wrong that was .
billy 's journey started in senegal and ended more than five months later in italy .
enlarge map i left dakar in november 1999 , hoping to be in europe for the millennium .
i paid $ 1,300 to a man , who said that would cover the cost of the transport , food and water all the way to europe .
i left with just $ 90 on me .
i took the train to the malian capital , bamako , but there , the man i had been told to contact said he had n't been paid .
i phoned dakar and asked for my money back .
the man said he could only refund $ 930 , which my dad sent by western union .
doubts in mali , i met people from across africa - they were all trying to reach europe .
speaking to them opened my eyes for the first time to the true dangers of the overland trip .
photo journal : billy 's return home i heard about many people who had died trying to cross the sahara and met some people who had decided to return home rather than risk losing their lives .
i met a senegalese man , who had reached ceuta before being deported to the border between morocco and algeria .
he had managed to make it back to bamako but he had no money and his feet were badly swollen from the journey back across the desert .
he told me that because of the conflict with islamic radicals , the algerian police often shot on sight people they came across in remote areas .
i also heard about armed robbers who would rob migrants of all their money and leave them for dead in the desert .
i was really afraid , but i was also encouraged when he said that three people he had been with had managed to get into europe .
i began to have real doubts about the trip and phoned my family .
my mum was terrified and told me to go back home .
but my dad said that he had had a dream that i would be okay .
he blessed me and told me to carry on .
i met a man who said he was organising a trip .
eight of us flew to timbuktu , where we joined another seven migrants from across west africa .
graves in the desert in timbuktu the 15 of us got into the back of a lorry .
we travelled by night before reaching gao , the last stop before the desert .
our driver stopped and showed us the graves of seven people , including a 21-year-old woman from nigeria there , we met thousands of other migrants waiting for transport across the sahara .
we bought bread and tinned sardines for the journey .
we poured water into the inner tubes of car tyres , which hold more than bottles .
normally we only travelled at night .
that first afternoon , our driver stopped and showed us the graves of seven people , including a 21-year-old woman from nigeria .
he said he had found their bodies - their lorry had broken down in the middle of the desert and they had waited in vain for help , before dying of thirst .
i had terrible diarrhoea , probably because of the water .
but i had to keep on drinking it or i would become dehydrated .
at night , it was cold and windy - we were only covered by a tarpaulin in the back of the lorry and hardly got any sleep .
during the day , we rested underneath the lorry , because that was the only shade .
but we could n't sleep because of the suffocating heat .
and the sand got everywhere - in our noses , eyes , ears and throats .
it took a week to cross the sahara before we reached tindouf in algeria .
there we were stopped by the police .
our driver was arrested and the police beat us up .
i have still got the scars on my back .
mountain crossing we had given our papers and money to the driver and we never saw him again .
we were given 24 hours to leave the country .
billy -lrb- left -rrb- was told as a child that father christmas lived in france luckily , one of the nigerians had hidden some money in his shoes and he gave us each $ 5 .
with that we bought some trinkets to sell so we could raise enough money to continue our journey .
we stayed in tindouf for three weeks in an abandoned house , until we met a senegalese man who told us he could take us across the border .
one nigerian man had become very sick on the journey across the desert , so he stayed in hospital in tindouf .
three others gave up the journey after we were told that we would have to walk for 20km through the mountains into morocco , to avoid the official border crossings .
our guide told us that lots of migrants died in these mountains after being deported from morocco and abandoned .
after two days of walking , the 11 of us reached a village , where we got a bus to casablanca .
hope in sight in all the time since we left bamako - more than a month - we had not washed .
my body was covered in fleas and i had bites everywhere .
it was terrible - we looked like mad men .
it was an amazing sight - after all i had been through , to finally see my destination , even if i knew i had n't reached it yet in casablanca , five of us managed to find work on building sites but we did n't earn much and we only ate one meal a day - a few mouthfuls of rice and little fish .
i knew i would need to find more money to continue my journey and used some of my first month 's pay to phone home again .
my wife sold our television and my family managed to borrow some more money from friends and relations .
when i went to pick up the $ 700 they sent me , i met two senegalese men who were also collecting money to pay for their trip to europe .
they had a moroccan guide , who agreed to take me as well , for $ 600 .
in casablanca , the three of us boarded a bus for tangier , where we found a hotel full of migrants , all trying to reach europe .
that night , i went up to the roof-top and saw about 20 people gazing across the mediterranean sea , where they could see the lights of the spanish mainland twinkling on the other side .
it was an amazing sight - after all i had been through , to finally see my destination , even if i knew i had n't reached it yet .

as immigration controls in western countries become stricter , they resort to increasingly desperate methods to reach their " promised land " , and every year , an unknown number of people , probably in the tens of thousands , die in the attempt .
billy , 41 , from guinea , tells the extraordinary tale of how he crossed the sahara desert to reach morocco , where he smuggled himself into the spanish enclave of ceuta .
he is now working in italy , where he has been given a residence permit , and has just been back to see his family for the first time since he set out on his adventure more than four years ago .
it has always been my dream to go europe .
when i was a young boy , africans living in europe would visit us wearing their fancy clothes and flashing their money around .
we also knew some french people , who told us how wonderful france was and that father christmas lived there .
growing up in the fouta djalon region of guinea , life was extremely tough .
i had to walk 5km to and from school every day and then work in the fields for three or four hours .
i was told it would take a week to reach spain ...
little did i know how wrong that was when i was 22 , we moved to the senegalese capital , dakar , where i found work helping out in the main hospital .
i got some training and became a nurse .
i stayed there for 17 years and got a medal for my long service .
although i had a job , i could never look after my wife idiatou and my baby daughter as i would have wished on my meagre salary of $ 130 .
i wanted to have my own house and give my children the good start in life i never had .
going to europe seemed to be the best way to achieve these goals .
many of my friends had emigrated - i felt i was being left behind .
stranded i had heard that travelling overland was much cheaper than flying - and you did n't need a visa .
i was also told it would take a week to reach spain .
little did i know how wrong that was .
billy 's journey started in senegal and ended more than five months later in italy .
enlarge map i left dakar in november 1999 , hoping to be in europe for the millennium .
i paid $ 1,300 to a man , who said that would cover the cost of the transport , food and water all the way to europe .
i left with just $ 90 on me .
i took the train to the malian capital , bamako , but there , the man i had been told to contact said he had n't been paid .
i phoned dakar and asked for my money back .
the man said he could only refund $ 930 , which my dad sent by western union .
doubts in mali , i met people from across africa - they were all trying to reach europe .
speaking to them opened my eyes for the first time to the true dangers of the overland trip .
photo journal : billy 's return home i heard about many people who had died trying to cross the sahara and met some people who had decided to return home rather than risk losing their lives .
i met a senegalese man , who had reached ceuta before being deported to the border between morocco and algeria .
he had managed to make it back to bamako but he had no money and his feet were badly swollen from the journey back across the desert .
he told me that because of the conflict with islamic radicals , the algerian police often shot on sight people they came across in remote areas .
i also heard about armed robbers who would rob migrants of all their money and leave them for dead in the desert .
i was really afraid , but i was also encouraged when he said that three people he had been with had managed to get into europe .
i began to have real doubts about the trip and phoned my family .
my mum was terrified and told me to go back home .
but my dad said that he had had a dream that i would be okay .
he blessed me and told me to carry on .
i met a man who said he was organising a trip .
eight of us flew to timbuktu , where we joined another seven migrants from across west africa .
graves in the desert in timbuktu the 15 of us got into the back of a lorry .
we travelled by night before reaching gao , the last stop before the desert .
our driver stopped and showed us the graves of seven people , including a 21-year-old woman from nigeria there , we met thousands of other migrants waiting for transport across the sahara .
we bought bread and tinned sardines for the journey .
we poured water into the inner tubes of car tyres , which hold more than bottles .
normally we only travelled at night .
that first afternoon , our driver stopped and showed us the graves of seven people , including a 21-year-old woman from nigeria .
he said he had found their bodies - their lorry had broken down in the middle of the desert and they had waited in vain for help , before dying of thirst .
i had terrible diarrhoea , probably because of the water .
but i had to keep on drinking it or i would become dehydrated .
at night , it was cold and windy - we were only covered by a tarpaulin in the back of the lorry and hardly got any sleep .
during the day , we rested underneath the lorry , because that was the only shade .
but we could n't sleep because of the suffocating heat .
and the sand got everywhere - in our noses , eyes , ears and throats .
it took a week to cross the sahara before we reached tindouf in algeria .
there we were stopped by the police .
our driver was arrested and the police beat us up .
i have still got the scars on my back .
mountain crossing we had given our papers and money to the driver and we never saw him again .
we were given 24 hours to leave the country .
billy -lrb- left -rrb- was told as a child that father christmas lived in france luckily , one of the nigerians had hidden some money in his shoes and he gave us each $ 5 .
with that we bought some trinkets to sell so we could raise enough money to continue our journey .
we stayed in tindouf for three weeks in an abandoned house , until we met a senegalese man who told us he could take us across the border .
one nigerian man had become very sick on the journey across the desert , so he stayed in hospital in tindouf .
three others gave up the journey after we were told that we would have to walk for 20km through the mountains into morocco , to avoid the official border crossings .
our guide told us that lots of migrants died in these mountains after being deported from morocco and abandoned .
after two days of walking , the 11 of us reached a village , where we got a bus to casablanca .
hope in sight in all the time since we left bamako - more than a month - we had not washed .
my body was covered in fleas and i had bites everywhere .
it was terrible - we looked like mad men .
it was an amazing sight - after all i had been through , to finally see my destination , even if i knew i had n't reached it yet in casablanca , five of us managed to find work on building sites but we did n't earn much and we only ate one meal a day - a few mouthfuls of rice and little fish .
i knew i would need to find more money to continue my journey and used some of my first month 's pay to phone home again .
my wife sold our television and my family managed to borrow some more money from friends and relations .
when i went to pick up the $ 700 they sent me , i met two senegalese men who were also collecting money to pay for their trip to europe .
they had a moroccan guide , who agreed to take me as well , for $ 600 .
in casablanca , the three of us boarded a bus for tangier , where we found a hotel full of migrants , all trying to reach europe .

but the association of the british pharmaceutical industry said its estimates put the figure at £ 1.4bn.
uk manufacturers have voiced concern over parallel trade - importing drugs from an eu country at cheap prices .
the esrc also warned the trade could impact on research and development in the industry as profits suffer .
dr stefan szymanski , of imperial college london , who led the esrc study , said : " the impact of parallel trade on pharmaceutical markets has been the source of great controversy . "
on the one hand importers see themselves as " benign agents prompting competition " , he said .
' research suffers ' " by contrast , pharmaceutical manufacturers view the activities of parallel traders as undermining company profits and thus investment in research and development . "
the abpi echoed his concerns , adding : " the only people to benefit are the importers .
the group has estimated that around one in eight prescriptions handed out in the uk contains parallel imported products .
dr symanski 's research concluded that while purchasers like the nhs would derive short term benefits from the trade - in the form of cheaper prices - overall it had a negative impact on the uk economy .
esrc found parallel trade imports make up about 20 % of the uk market , with some products up to 15 % cheaper .
based on these figures he calculated a £ 480m gain for the uk economy , against a £ 770m loss for drug firms - a net loss of £ 290m .
to cut losses to the uk , the report suggested the government take action to change its purchasing policy .
parallel trade is a legal practice and so can not be banned in the uk .

investing in south african companies is seen as " high-risk " and the initiative is seen a means of bringing nationalisation through the back door , according to geoff miller from london-based bridgewell securities .
as such , giving equity and jobs to the underprivileged amounts to a tax , some investors insist .
but mr miller , along with a host of other analysts , believe they are wrong .
access empowerment will not upset the apple cart , several analysts agreed at a recent conference in london .
on the contrary , empowerment - which is enshrined in south africa 's financial services charter which came into effect this year - will lead to growth , they stressed .
bee ' score cards ' 30 % of points related to black ownership 30 % to numbers of black board members , employees and training 30 % related to how well a company promotes enterprise 10 % issues which will be determined by each industry empowerment should lead to the promotion of black south africans , including women , to company boards and transform the way companies choose their staff .
and it should make financial services available to more people .
to make this happen , the industry aims to make sure that eight in 10 south africans will have a bank within 20 kilometres of their homes or work places in the next few years procurement how well companies fare under the black economic empowerment initiative will be measured by points recorded on a score card , made public at the same time a company announces its annual results .
poverty still reigns in south africa the initiative is also about how a company chooses firms that provide it with services .
" in south africa , there are a lot of old boys ' networks , " said nkosana mashiya , banking director at the south africa 's treasury .
" the charter promotes procurement from a broader industry . "
greater gap most people agree that south africa , which is gearing up to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its first free election , must overhaul its economy to avoid instability .
many black south africans still live in desperate poverty , and for a large number the situation is getting worse , rather than better , according to experts .
a survey by id21 last year found that blacks are getting poorer in the new south africa , while whites are getting richer .
in 2002 , two out of three black households in cape town townships did not have enough to eat , the development research body said .
not to reform , said the south african high commissioner in london , dr lindiwe mabuza , would lead to people becoming " discontent , disillusioned and even cynical " .
bee benefits business but the government is promoting the view that the empowerment initiative - which is not compulsory - will actually help the country reach its annual growth target of 6 % - up from a modest but consistent 3 % .
but sceptics insist this would be tricky , especially given that the initiatives are going to cost money .
investec : bee goals for 2008 procurement from bee companies 50 % -lrb- present level 13 % -rrb- black south african board members 33 % -lrb- present level 25 % black south african executives 25 % -lrb- present level 10 % -rrb- the initiative will promote entrepreneurship and improve skills of the workforce , said lionel october , deputy director of south africa 's department for trade and industry .
a redistribution of wealth will assist growth , he insisted .
besides , there is flexibility within the initiative , especially for foreign companies with subsidiaries in south africa , he said .
funeral services insurers old mutual has fully embraced the reform , though its chief executive , jim sutcliffe suggested that some companies have internationalised their operations to escape the initiative .
his own company has benefited , however , by expanding its services to black south africans in the form of funeral insurance .
this is the type of behaviour the initiative wants to encourage .
there is no alternative for any supplier not to empower itself - it 's a very subtle way to ensure transformation david lawrence , investec given the country 's high hiv infection rate and the high cost of hiv testing , funeral insurance was something no one wanted to get into , but old mutual found a way of making money from it by using statistics .
so although the initiative " is seen as a big threat " by many , " if you set about it you find opportunities " , said mr sutcliffe .
tough targets the investment company investec admits that some of the empowerment targets will be difficult to reach by the initiative 's first review date in 2008 .
for example , the initiative calls for change to ensure that more than 11 % of its board members and 4 % of its executives will be black women in five years time , whereas there are currently none .
furthermore , presently only 13 % of companies servicing investec are black empowered ; by 2008 the initiative wants that rate to reach 50 % .
but like many companies in south africa , investec backs the reform and will provide 3,000 would-be entrepreneurs with help each month .
ignorance " there is no alternative for any supplier not to empower itself , " said david lawrence , deputy managing director of investec south africa .
" it 's a very subtle way to ensure transformation . "
others agreed .
" they are reforming without a revolution , " said one conference delegate .
" look at zimbabwe . "
" there is no doubt overseas investors in south african companies are worried , " aid another delegate .
" the perception of south africa is bad enough without -lsb- the empowerment initiative -rsb- .
but it 's because they do n't know much about it . "

poverty still reigns in south africa the initiative is also about how a company chooses firms that provide it with services .
" in south africa , there are a lot of old boys ' networks , " said nkosana mashiya , banking director at the south africa 's treasury .
" the charter promotes procurement from a broader industry . "
greater gap most people agree that south africa , which is gearing up to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its first free election , must overhaul its economy to avoid instability .
many black south africans still live in desperate poverty , and for a large number the situation is getting worse , rather than better , according to experts .
a survey by id21 last year found that blacks are getting poorer in the new south africa , while whites are getting richer .
in 2002 , two out of three black households in cape town townships did not have enough to eat , the development research body said .

funeral services insurers old mutual has fully embraced the reform , though its chief executive , jim sutcliffe suggested that some companies have internationalised their operations to escape the initiative .
his own company has benefited , however , by expanding its services to black south africans in the form of funeral insurance .
this is the type of behaviour the initiative wants to encourage .
there is no alternative for any supplier not to empower itself - it 's a very subtle way to ensure transformation david lawrence , investec given the country 's high hiv infection rate and the high cost of hiv testing , funeral insurance was something no one wanted to get into , but old mutual found a way of making money from it by using statistics .
so although the initiative " is seen as a big threat " by many , " if you set about it you find opportunities " , said mr sutcliffe .
tough targets the investment company investec admits that some of the empowerment targets will be difficult to reach by the initiative 's first review date in 2008 .
for example , the initiative calls for change to ensure that more than 11 % of its board members and 4 % of its executives will be black women in five years time , whereas there are currently none .
furthermore , presently only 13 % of companies servicing investec are black empowered ; by 2008 the initiative wants that rate to reach 50 % .
but like many companies in south africa , investec backs the reform and will provide 3,000 would-be entrepreneurs with help each month .

this is result is a resounding rejection of the left-wing in its current form .
it is unlikely that mr handal , a 73-year-old communist former guerrilla commander , will stand again .
it seems that for the left to become a significant force in modern salvadorean politics , its leaders will have to modernise .

although only a few hundred asylum seekers and refugees now stay in the town at any one time , many people say that for a town of just 33,000 and barely any ethnic diversity , the numbers have been a lot to cope with .
dover , a town of 33,000 , has hosted thousands of immigrants and it has not been without its problems .
in 1999 , kent county council leader sandy bruce-lockhart warned the government that tensions were rising and there was a " tinder box " atmosphere .
two weeks later , tensions came to a head in a day of violence at a funfair in which at least 11 people were injured and eight stabbed .
the leader of dover district council paul watkins said local people had felt overwhelmed by the " sheer numbers " of new arrivals .
they strained the infrastructure of the town which " caused a great deal of resentment " , he said .
dover residents talk about their town 's experiences of asylum and immigration in pictures " the schools coped very well , there was a policy to make sure the children were spread out , " he said .
" but there was a notable reduction in healthcare facilities for locals to start with . "
annie ledger of migrant helpline , which looks after asylum seekers in dover , said their impact on the town 's infrastructure were " more of a perception " than a reality .
but with the tabloids whipping up anti-immigration feeling on an almost daily basis , it was understandable that people thought otherwise , she said .
' intimidating ' the biggest problem , said mr watkins , was that almost all the asylum seekers were housed in one small , central area - at one point , 1,200 asylum seekers were crowded into a ward of 3,600 people .
most were in just one street , called folkestone road - a pleasant enough road of victorian terraced houses and b & bs whose character was turned upside down , according to locals , almost overnight .

" everyone was .

dover police 's community liaison officer mick cronin said the number of arrivals was an unprecedented problem for such a town , and policies had to be more or less made up on the hoof .
" it was just crisis management , " he said .
" so many people were arriving , about 90 a day , they had to be helped - they needed healthcare , housing , clothing - and the needs of the local people just got overlooked . "
he said local people were initially never consulted or even told what was going on - something which led to increasing frustration which he tried to tackle with weekly workshops in the folkestone road .
spitting it also did nothing to stop false rumours about asylum seekers flying around - and although this is something which the authorities are trying to tackle , misinformation undoubtedly still exists .
" dover 's a small town and almost entirely ethnically white , " says ms ledger .
" people can misinterpret what they see .
" a classic example is that one resident told a councillor that a group of asylum seekers were in argos buying up a lot of expensive goods .
the councillor went to investigate and found they were the crew of a cruise-ship docked in the port . "

although only a few hundred asylum seekers and refugees now stay in the town at any one time , many people say that for a town of just 33,000 and barely any ethnic diversity , the numbers have been a lot to cope with .
dover , a town of 33,000 , has hosted thousands of immigrants and it has not been without its problems .
in 1999 , kent county council leader sandy bruce-lockhart warned the government that tensions were rising and there was a " tinder box " atmosphere .
two weeks later , tensions came to a head in a day of violence at a funfair in which at least 11 people were injured and eight stabbed .
the leader of dover district council paul watkins said local people had felt overwhelmed by the " sheer numbers " of new arrivals .
they strained the infrastructure of the town which " caused a great deal of resentment " , he said .
dover residents talk about their town 's experiences of asylum and immigration in pictures " the schools coped very well , there was a policy to make sure the children were spread out , " he said .
" but there was a notable reduction in healthcare facilities for locals to start with . "
annie ledger of migrant helpline , which looks after asylum seekers in dover , said their impact on the town 's infrastructure were " more of a perception " than a reality .
but with the tabloids whipping up anti-immigration feeling on an almost daily basis , it was understandable that people thought otherwise , she said .
' intimidating ' the biggest problem , said mr watkins , was that almost all the asylum seekers were housed in one small , central area - at one point , 1,200 asylum seekers were crowded into a ward of 3,600 people .
most were in just one street , called folkestone road - a pleasant enough road of victorian terraced houses and b & bs whose character was turned upside down , according to locals , almost overnight .

" everyone was .
they were just milling about in huge gangs .
i counted 67 at one point .
it was very intimidating . "
dover police 's community liaison officer mick cronin said the number of arrivals was an unprecedented problem for such a town , and policies had to be more or less made up on the hoof .
" it was just crisis management , " he said .
" so many people were arriving , about 90 a day , they had to be helped - they needed healthcare , housing , clothing - and the needs of the local people just got overlooked . "
he said local people were initially never consulted or even told what was going on - something which led to increasing frustration which he tried to tackle with weekly workshops in the folkestone road .
spitting it also did nothing to stop false rumours about asylum seekers flying around - and although this is something which the authorities are trying to tackle , misinformation undoubtedly still exists .
" dover 's a small town and almost entirely ethnically white , " says ms ledger .
" people can misinterpret what they see .
" a classic example is that one resident told a councillor that a group of asylum seekers were in argos buying up a lot of expensive goods .
the councillor went to investigate and found they were the crew of a cruise-ship docked in the port . "

changes to government policies have meant more asylum seekers are being housed elsewhere ; there are fewer arrivals ; and more work has been done to help communities engage with each other .
mr cronin is now working with other towns to help them prepare for arriving asylum seekers .

although only a few hundred asylum seekers and refugees now stay in the town at any one time , many people say that for a town of just 33,000 and barely any ethnic diversity , the numbers have been a lot to cope with .
dover , a town of 33,000 , has hosted thousands of immigrants and it has not been without its problems .
in 1999 , kent county council leader sandy bruce-lockhart warned the government that tensions were rising and there was a " tinder box " atmosphere .
two weeks later , tensions came to a head in a day of violence at a funfair in which at least 11 people were injured and eight stabbed .
the leader of dover district council paul watkins said local people had felt overwhelmed by the " sheer numbers " of new arrivals .
they strained the infrastructure of the town which " caused a great deal of resentment " , he said .
dover residents talk about their town 's experiences of asylum and immigration in pictures " the schools coped very well , there was a policy to make sure the children were spread out , " he said .
" but there was a notable reduction in healthcare facilities for locals to start with . "
annie ledger of migrant helpline , which looks after asylum seekers in dover , said their impact on the town 's infrastructure were " more of a perception " than a reality .
but with the tabloids whipping up anti-immigration feeling on an almost daily basis , it was understandable that people thought otherwise , she said .
' intimidating ' the biggest problem , said mr watkins , was that almost all the asylum seekers were housed in one small , central area - at one point , 1,200 asylum seekers were crowded into a ward of 3,600 people .
most were in just one street , called folkestone road - a pleasant enough road of victorian terraced houses and b & bs whose character was turned upside down , according to locals , almost overnight .

" everyone was .
they were just milling about in huge gangs .
i counted 67 at one point .
it was very intimidating . "
dover police 's community liaison officer mick cronin said the number of arrivals was an unprecedented problem for such a town , and policies had to be more or less made up on the hoof .
" it was just crisis management , " he said .
" so many people were arriving , about 90 a day , they had to be helped - they needed healthcare , housing , clothing - and the needs of the local people just got overlooked . "
he said local people were initially never consulted or even told what was going on - something which led to increasing frustration which he tried to tackle with weekly workshops in the folkestone road .
spitting it also did nothing to stop false rumours about asylum seekers flying around - and although this is something which the authorities are trying to tackle , misinformation undoubtedly still exists .
" dover 's a small town and almost entirely ethnically white , " says ms ledger .
" people can misinterpret what they see .
" a classic example is that one resident told a councillor that a group of asylum seekers were in argos buying up a lot of expensive goods .
the councillor went to investigate and found they were the crew of a cruise-ship docked in the port . "

although only a few hundred asylum seekers and refugees now stay in the town at any one time , many people say that for a town of just 33,000 and barely any ethnic diversity , the numbers have been a lot to cope with .
dover , a town of 33,000 , has hosted thousands of immigrants and it has not been without its problems .
in 1999 , kent county council leader sandy bruce-lockhart warned the government that tensions were rising and there was a " tinder box " atmosphere .
two weeks later , tensions came to a head in a day of violence at a funfair in which at least 11 people were injured and eight stabbed .

mario siano , a coastguard spokesman , said a new attempt will be started at the next high tide at 1916 gmt .
peter ripley , a local resident , said : " you can see the water coming from the spout of the whale and it is still thrashing about . "
" the rescue attempt has been unsuccessful this morning but they will try again tonight , " he said .
last-ditch attempt inspector john bow of the rspca said a veterinary surgeon will check the whale later on monday to reassess its health .
he said : " it is a deepwater animal and should n't be there , it has obviously lost its way . "
the team had resumed efforts to free the 15-ton animal from a sand bank at sutton bridge in the wash shortly before the 0700 gmt high tide .
its respiratory rate is currently around five breaths per minute tony woodley rescue team spokesman " we are not really equipped to lift an animal of this size so this is really a last-ditch attempt , " said alan knight from the rescue team .
" it will probably die if we do not save it today , " he said .
the whale was spotted by a member of the public at about 10am on sunday .
it is not known how it came to be on the bank .
it might have become stranded due to ill health , or it could have been confused by the sand banks and shallow water of the the wash .
volunteers spent sunday trying to keep the whale upright so its lungs did not collapse under its own weight .
they had to leave the animal overnight when the coastguard warned them that deteriorating weather would put them at risk .

mario siano , a coastguard spokesman , said a new attempt will be started at the next high tide at 1916 gmt .
peter ripley , a local resident , said : " you can see the water coming from the spout of the whale and it is still thrashing about . "
" the rescue attempt has been unsuccessful this morning but they will try again tonight , " he said .
last-ditch attempt inspector john bow of the rspca said a veterinary surgeon will check the whale later on monday to reassess its health .
he said : " it is a deepwater animal and should n't be there , it has obviously lost its way . "
the team had resumed efforts to free the 15-ton animal from a sand bank at sutton bridge in the wash shortly before the 0700 gmt high tide .
its respiratory rate is currently around five breaths per minute tony woodley rescue team spokesman " we are not really equipped to lift an animal of this size so this is really a last-ditch attempt , " said alan knight from the rescue team .
" it will probably die if we do not save it today , " he said .
the whale was spotted by a member of the public at about 10am on sunday .
it is not known how it came to be on the bank .
it might have become stranded due to ill health , or it could have been confused by the sand banks and shallow water of the the wash .
volunteers spent sunday trying to keep the whale upright so its lungs did not collapse under its own weight .
they had to leave the animal overnight when the coastguard warned them that deteriorating weather would put them at risk .
" its respiratory rate is currently around five breaths per minute , " rescue spokesman tony woodley said .
" this means the animal is stressed , as these larger species normally breath only a maximum of once a minute .

des james ' daughter , cheryl , 18 , from llangollen , north wales , was one of four recruits who died from gunshots .
mr james has said he will fight for a judicial review if mr hoon blocks the families ' demand for a public inquiry .
while there have been inquiries into the deaths , the families want an independent , public investigation .
the recruits aged 17 to 20 died at deepcut barracks between 1995 and 2002 .
their deaths were recorded as suicide .
the defence secretary is still considering the families ' request for a public inquiry .
i feel absolutely confident that if we did take that route we would be successful des james mr james , who now lives at llanymynech in powys , met lawyers in london last week to discuss possible legal action .
" it is not something we would wish to do because of the cost and it is a painful process dealing with having lost your child , " he said .
" i feel the mod could be a little more compassionate .
" my grief is not raw anymore , my daughter died eight years ago , but i still want to know what happened .
" i feel absolutely confident that if we did take that route we would be successful . "
mr james said he thought the families of the three other dead soldiers from deepcut would join the legal fight .
further investigations private cheryl james was found dead with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in november 1995 .
the three other soldiers to die at the royal logistics corps hq were geoff gray , 17 , from durham , sean benton , 20 , from hastings , east sussex , and james collinson , 17 , from perth .
earlier this month a committee of mps said they will investigate the " duty of care " regime of the army , raf and navy towards their recruits , following the deepcut deaths .
but it will not investigate individual deaths at the barracks or question the findings of the police , army or coroner about how the deaths occurred .
the inquiry is expected to report early next year .
surrey police at the same time called for a broader inquiry after their investigation into the deaths of the four young soldiers .

eccleston , who starred alongside nicole kidman in the horror movie the others , will be the ninth tv time lord to control the tardis in a 13-part series .
the 40-year-old has starred in flesh and blood , the second coming , and tv series our friends in the north .
the bbc said the salford-born actor would take " a fresh , modern approach " .
' edgy and eccentric ' jane tranter , bbc controller of drama commissioning , said : " we are delighted to have cast an actor of such calibre in one of british television 's most iconic roles .
it 's going to be a magnificent , epic , entertaining journey russell t davies bbc executive producer " it signals our intention to take doctor who into the 21st century , as well as retaining its core traditional values - to be surprising , edgy and eccentric . "
executive producer and writer russell t davies said : " christopher was our first choice .
" his casting raises the bar for all of us .
it 's going to be a magnificent , epic , entertaining journey , and i ca n't wait to start . "
previous tv time lords william hartnell patrick troughton jon pertwee tom baker peter davison colin baker sylvester mccoy paul mcgann the hugely-popular doctor who show ran for 26 years from 1963 and the new series will be filmed in cardiff later this year .
he first came to public attention with his portrayal of derek bentley in the film , let him have it before notching up a wealth of tv and movie credits .
he was then snapped up by hollywood and was cast in david cronenberg 's existenz with jude law , and gone in sixty seconds with nicholas cage .
he trained at the central school of speech and drama in london .
what do you think about the decision to cast christopher eccleston as the new dr who ?
this debate is now closed but please see below for some of your thoughts on the new time lord .
your comments : i must agree he is an excellent choice to play the doctor , the last thing i wanted was another peter davison !
mazhar khan , uk eccleston was superb in the zombie movie 28 days later , portraying a calm , intelligent and charismatic army officer , who had eccentric delusions of grandeur .
i think this role may give us a small insight into the kind portayal of the doctor .
fantastic casting choice , -lrb- but would have given anything to have seen a cross dressing , izzard in the role -rrb- steve crabb , london , uk what a great choice to play the doctor .
it 's a great relief that they have chosen an actor proven as in both dramatic and comedic roles !
good luck bbc and mr davies - do all of us long-term fans proud ! ! !
adam , worcestershire a great actor , but who surely can only be as good as the scripts he 's given .
so well done to the beeb on getting russell t davies , mark gatiss and steven moffatt for such a task !
the chances are , whether you 've heard all or none of these names that you 'll be a big fan of some of their work already .
lee hayes , london , uk i do n't know if he 's quite sinister enough .
the best doctors always had a slight air of menace about them .
colin baker and peter davison were too nice and not convincing enough .
peter , u.k yes , this is a great and imaginative choice .
sheena hastings , great choice for the 9th doctor .
what i would like to see is paul mcgann in the first episode for the regeneration handover .
elliott burge , lydney , gloucestershire , uk i ca n't wait !
if his portrayal of doctor who has me hiding behind the sofa again , then he will have recaptured all what was lost when tom baker turned into peter davidson .
john turner , plymouth , uk i ca n't believe this appalling decision .
christopher eccleston has to be the worst actor of all time .
as someone who is n't a particular fan of the doctor , but does enjoy watching the series as a fan of all sci-fi i really do n't think i 'll be tuning in to the new series .
dave mahoney , strood , kent , uk it has been said before and will be said many times in the future , but what the heck ... christopher eccleston , an inspired piece of casting .
hope this is a taste of what hopefully will be the return to the bbc the good doctor deserves .
martin kelly , birstall west yorkshire the logical progression of the ' edgy eccentricity ' which was hinted at by mcgann , will find high evolution in the inspired casting of eccleston , who is truly an actor of considerable talent , and fervent support in the fan -lrb- atic -rrb- 's like myself , who have waited , waited , to once again step foot inside that familiar blue police call box ..
val athanassiou , sydney australia what a stupdendous choice !
this talented actor lends himself is well suited for this particular role .
with the current high interest in all things extra terrestrial , the timing and return of the doctor who series could not be better .
bring on the talented writers to write the material and we look forward with great interest .
ray khan , toronto , canada great actor for a great role .
rob humphreys , perth , western australia fantastic choice .
very surprised and delighted that he accepted the part .
should bring the show back into the public arena again .
bob booth , tilbury , essex , uk i am so excited .
having been away and discovering on my return that doctor who is going to be on the air again just made by day .
and i am so looking forward to seeing the taped programmes from my relatives and friends and hopefully one day it will be introduced to canada because they are ready for this .
good luck .
anna stevens , chester canada fantastic choice .
i 'm so excited that he is going to play the doctor .
he will bring a new sparkle to the show , one that has never been shown before .
shannon burns , philadelphia , pa , usa i was n't quite sure how to take this news .
i have only seen christopher eccleston play gritty hard roles and am concerned that he wo n't have that underlying eccentricity that is much needed for the role .
however , i do think he is a remarkable actor and just because i have n't seen him do anything like this before , does n't mean that he ca n't .
i have faith in the writers and producers .
i can not wait to see the new series .
ben ripleu , melbourne , australia what a brilliant choice and what a brilliant actor .
well known to some and yet a complete unknown to others .
doctor who will make him the star he deserves to be , but he will also undoubtedly help to raise the profile of the show even higher .
a truely symbotic relationship and a truely inpired casting decision .
neil taylor , london let 's face it , doctor who is not that disimilar to star trek in that many aspects of it were laughable .
however , eccleston is likely to do something interesting in the role , which will hopefully result in something similar to the injection of credibility that patrick stewart provided for the next generation .
richard , pavia , italy .
the doctor is in the hands of some highly skilled and passionate programme makers and writers - and for them to have chosen him , they must have some amazing and interesting plans for the show .
time to reclaim the batton from the americans .
the british always did do science fiction best .
julian bashford , elstead , uk let 's hope that this will resurect dr. who from the dire run with sylvester mccoy and paul mcgann and breathe new life into what used to be a great sci-fi series !
james , essex , uk from jesus to the lord of time ! superb actor , superb choice iain hewitt , darlington , uk i 'd have preferred richard e grant , possibly because of the beeb ' cult ' online animated episodes featuring him , which have been great .
mr eccleston should do a good job though .
hj , ipswich , uk i felt the same about this announcement as i did about paul mcgann - excellent choice .
but this time the team that has been assembled to create the new series is amazing .
they 've all had experience of creating quality doctor who in other formats .
i 'm expecting great things !
faiz , surrey , uk excellent choice of doctor .
i always thought it became a bit rubbish in the 1980s , because colin baker and sylvester mccoy made the role too lightweight .
christoper eccleston will bring back the gritty , hard-edged , darkness that it had with tom baker and jon pertwee .
can we have kate winslet to play his assistant .
and peter andre to play davros .
john smith , manchester uk super choice .
christopher is a dynamic performer .
looking forward to his interpretation .
trish lewis , fargo , north dakota , usa i 've seen christopher in quite a lot of his roles and yes , i think he 'll be extremely good for doctor who .
he can be quirky enough , yet not quite taking it into comedic which will mean he should be taken seriously .
i think most people will agree that doctor who in the end was just becoming too laughable .
it needs ' edge ' and i think mr eccleston will deliver !
amanda , birmingham , uk as more news appears about the forthcoming doctor who series , the more i am looking forward to it .
with such a wealth of talent throughout whether it be the writing or -lrb- with this latest news -rrb- the actors it ca n't fail to be a momentous tv event andy clayton , christchurch , dorset , uk eccleston is a fine actor whom i am sure we will see more of in the future j wood , green zone , baghdad a very good choice .
eccleston is a fine actor whom i am sure we will see more of in the future .
he has sufficient depth to play the character and with his ability to play such diverse roles , it will be interesting to see his interpretation .
is there any chance that eccleston might do one story with tom baker ' doctors meet in time ' ?
j wood , green zone , baghdad , iraq christopher eccleston is an inspired choice and was one of my top three choices - along with bill nighy and ian richardson .
absolutely stunning and i 'm sure he 'll be perfect for the role .
well done to the crew for securing the talents of such an amazing actor .
david whittam , streatham hill , uk fantastic news and a great piece of casting - roll on 2005 !
kevin thomas , southend , uk never heard of him - and that is exactly what was needed .
the doctor is a mysterious , alien character after all , and there would have been nothing worse than seeing a very well-known face -lrb- e.g. richard e grant -rrb- taking on the role .
eccleston certainly has that look of other-worldliness that is required .
good luck to him - i hope the scripts are worthy of the job .
mark jones , chipping campden , uk absolutely brilliant .
an inspired choice .
i 'm so excited that he brings such a level of professionalism to the show .
alan jones , beckenham , kent , uk wow !
completely taken by surprise , did n't see it coming at all , and yet ... perfect !

previous tv time lords william hartnell patrick troughton jon pertwee tom baker peter davison colin baker sylvester mccoy paul mcgann the hugely-popular doctor who show ran for 26 years from 1963 and the new series will be filmed in cardiff later this year .
he first came to public attention with his portrayal of derek bentley in the film , let him have it before notching up a wealth of tv and movie credits .
he was then snapped up by hollywood and was cast in david cronenberg 's existenz with jude law , and gone in sixty seconds with nicholas cage .
he trained at the central school of speech and drama in london .
what do you think about the decision to cast christopher eccleston as the new dr who ?
this debate is now closed but please see below for some of your thoughts on the new time lord .
your comments : i must agree he is an excellent choice to play the doctor , the last thing i wanted was another peter davison !
mazhar khan , uk eccleston was superb in the zombie movie 28 days later , portraying a calm , intelligent and charismatic army officer , who had eccentric delusions of grandeur .
i think this role may give us a small insight into the kind portayal of the doctor .
fantastic casting choice , -lrb- but would have given anything to have seen a cross dressing , izzard in the role -rrb- steve crabb , london , uk what a great choice to play the doctor .
it 's a great relief that they have chosen an actor proven as in both dramatic and comedic roles !
good luck bbc and mr davies - do all of us long-term fans proud ! ! !
adam , worcestershire a great actor , but who surely can only be as good as the scripts he 's given .
so well done to the beeb on getting russell t davies , mark gatiss and steven moffatt for such a task !
the chances are , whether you 've heard all or none of these names that you 'll be a big fan of some of their work already .
lee hayes , london , uk i do n't know if he 's quite sinister enough .
the best doctors always had a slight air of menace about them .
colin baker and peter davison were too nice and not convincing enough .
peter , u.k yes , this is a great and imaginative choice .
sheena hastings , great choice for the 9th doctor .
what i would like to see is paul mcgann in the first episode for the regeneration handover .
elliott burge , lydney , gloucestershire , uk i ca n't wait !
if his portrayal of doctor who has me hiding behind the sofa again , then he will have recaptured all what was lost when tom baker turned into peter davidson .
john turner , plymouth , uk i ca n't believe this appalling decision .
christopher eccleston has to be the worst actor of all time .
as someone who is n't a particular fan of the doctor , but does enjoy watching the series as a fan of all sci-fi i really do n't think i 'll be tuning in to the new series .
dave mahoney , strood , kent , uk it has been said before and will be said many times in the future , but what the heck ... christopher eccleston , an inspired piece of casting .
hope this is a taste of what hopefully will be the return to the bbc the good doctor deserves .
martin kelly , birstall west yorkshire the logical progression of the ' edgy eccentricity ' which was hinted at by mcgann , will find high evolution in the inspired casting of eccleston , who is truly an actor of considerable talent , and fervent support in the fan -lrb- atic -rrb- 's like myself , who have waited , waited , to once again step foot inside that familiar blue police call box ..
val athanassiou , sydney australia what a stupdendous choice !
this talented actor lends himself is well suited for this particular role .
with the current high interest in all things extra terrestrial , the timing and return of the doctor who series could not be better .
bring on the talented writers to write the material and we look forward with great interest .
ray khan , toronto , canada great actor for a great role .
rob humphreys , perth , western australia fantastic choice .
very surprised and delighted that he accepted the part .
should bring the show back into the public arena again .
bob booth , tilbury , essex , uk i am so excited .
having been away and discovering on my return that doctor who is going to be on the air again just made by day .
and i am so looking forward to seeing the taped programmes from my relatives and friends and hopefully one day it will be introduced to canada because they are ready for this .
good luck .
anna stevens , chester canada fantastic choice .
i 'm so excited that he is going to play the doctor .
he will bring a new sparkle to the show , one that has never been shown before .
shannon burns , philadelphia , pa , usa i was n't quite sure how to take this news .
i have only seen christopher eccleston play gritty hard roles and am concerned that he wo n't have that underlying eccentricity that is much needed for the role .
however , i do think he is a remarkable actor and just because i have n't seen him do anything like this before , does n't mean that he ca n't .
i have faith in the writers and producers .
i can not wait to see the new series .
ben ripleu , melbourne , australia what a brilliant choice and what a brilliant actor .
well known to some and yet a complete unknown to others .
doctor who will make him the star he deserves to be , but he will also undoubtedly help to raise the profile of the show even higher .
a truely symbotic relationship and a truely inpired casting decision .
neil taylor , london let 's face it , doctor who is not that disimilar to star trek in that many aspects of it were laughable .
however , eccleston is likely to do something interesting in the role , which will hopefully result in something similar to the injection of credibility that patrick stewart provided for the next generation .
richard , pavia , italy .
the doctor is in the hands of some highly skilled and passionate programme makers and writers - and for them to have chosen him , they must have some amazing and interesting plans for the show .
time to reclaim the batton from the americans .
the british always did do science fiction best .
julian bashford , elstead , uk let 's hope that this will resurect dr. who from the dire run with sylvester mccoy and paul mcgann and breathe new life into what used to be a great sci-fi series !
james , essex , uk from jesus to the lord of time ! superb actor , superb choice iain hewitt , darlington , uk i 'd have preferred richard e grant , possibly because of the beeb ' cult ' online animated episodes featuring him , which have been great .
mr eccleston should do a good job though .
hj , ipswich , uk i felt the same about this announcement as i did about paul mcgann - excellent choice .
but this time the team that has been assembled to create the new series is amazing .
they 've all had experience of creating quality doctor who in other formats .
i 'm expecting great things !
faiz , surrey , uk excellent choice of doctor .
i always thought it became a bit rubbish in the 1980s , because colin baker and sylvester mccoy made the role too lightweight .
christoper eccleston will bring back the gritty , hard-edged , darkness that it had with tom baker and jon pertwee .
can we have kate winslet to play his assistant .
and peter andre to play davros .
john smith , manchester uk super choice .
christopher is a dynamic performer .
looking forward to his interpretation .
trish lewis , fargo , north dakota , usa i 've seen christopher in quite a lot of his roles and yes , i think he 'll be extremely good for doctor who .
he can be quirky enough , yet not quite taking it into comedic which will mean he should be taken seriously .
i think most people will agree that doctor who in the end was just becoming too laughable .
it needs ' edge ' and i think mr eccleston will deliver !
amanda , birmingham , uk as more news appears about the forthcoming doctor who series , the more i am looking forward to it .
with such a wealth of talent throughout whether it be the writing or -lrb- with this latest news -rrb- the actors it ca n't fail to be a momentous tv event andy clayton , christchurch , dorset , uk eccleston is a fine actor whom i am sure we will see more of in the future j wood , green zone , baghdad a very good choice .
eccleston is a fine actor whom i am sure we will see more of in the future .
he has sufficient depth to play the character and with his ability to play such diverse roles , it will be interesting to see his interpretation .
is there any chance that eccleston might do one story with tom baker ' doctors meet in time ' ?
j wood , green zone , baghdad , iraq christopher eccleston is an inspired choice and was one of my top three choices - along with bill nighy and ian richardson .
absolutely stunning and i 'm sure he 'll be perfect for the role .
well done to the crew for securing the talents of such an amazing actor .
david whittam , streatham hill , uk fantastic news and a great piece of casting - roll on 2005 !
kevin thomas , southend , uk never heard of him - and that is exactly what was needed .
the doctor is a mysterious , alien character after all , and there would have been nothing worse than seeing a very well-known face -lrb- e.g. richard e grant -rrb- taking on the role .
eccleston certainly has that look of other-worldliness that is required .
good luck to him - i hope the scripts are worthy of the job .
mark jones , chipping campden , uk absolutely brilliant .
an inspired choice .
i 'm so excited that he brings such a level of professionalism to the show .
alan jones , beckenham , kent , uk wow !
completely taken by surprise , did n't see it coming at all , and yet ... perfect !

cost cutting " despite the iraq war , the sars epidemic and a very hot european summer persuading would be long-haul travelers to stay at home , we have recorded our first annual adjusted pretax profit , " said mr dhamija .
the results upturn comes after many of the firm 's customer service functions were " offshored " to india .
internet bookings for the first quarter of 2004 are up 40 % in the uk , and 107 % in the rest of europe .
" as over 80 % of our turnover is to mid and long-haul destinations we have seen little effect , if any , from the madrid bombings , " said mr dhamija .
savings plans include standardising websites and systems technologies throughout the group , and disposing of nine retail outlets following successful online conversion across europe and the uk .
ebookers was previously the internet arm of flightbookers , the travel agency founded by mr dhamija and his wife back in 1983 .

last week the government announced that the oral vaccine , promoted by the united nations , was safe to use .
the programme targets about 60 million children and centres on nigeria - where half of all new polio cases originate .

president olusegun obasanjo chose the capital of zamfara , gusau , to launch the latest round of vaccinations .
" since the controversy over the polio vaccine started , thousands of children in this state have been denied the opportunity to be immunised against the devastating disease and that has not augured well , " the president said during a televised ceremony .
warnings health experts have warned that the delay in vaccination in kano has already resulted in new polio cases .
the world health organization has denied the claims by muslim clerics that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent .
and its goal of eradicating polio from the world by next year is now looking increasingly distant .
polio has spread out from northern nigeria to infect people in at least seven west and central african states .
kano announced earlier this month that it would seek polio vaccines from asian countries .
but state spokesman sule ya 'u sule told ap news agency on sunday that kano would not be joining in .

kano opted out of a drive last year , when some islamic leaders said it was part of a western plot to render muslim women infertile .
last week the government announced that the oral vaccine , promoted by the united nations , was safe to use .
the programme targets about 60 million children and centres on nigeria - where half of all new polio cases originate .
the northern state of zamfara , which boycotted the campaign last year , is joining in this time .
president olusegun obasanjo chose the capital of zamfara , gusau , to launch the latest round of vaccinations .
" since the controversy over the polio vaccine started , thousands of children in this state have been denied the opportunity to be immunised against the devastating disease and that has not augured well , " the president said during a televised ceremony .
warnings health experts have warned that the delay in vaccination in kano has already resulted in new polio cases .
the world health organization has denied the claims by muslim clerics that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent .
and its goal of eradicating polio from the world by next year is now looking increasingly distant .
polio has spread out from northern nigeria to infect people in at least seven west and central african states .
kano announced earlier this month that it would seek polio vaccines from asian countries .
but state spokesman sule ya 'u sule told ap news agency on sunday that kano would not be joining in .
" we will only join when we receive uncontaminated vaccines or when our own vaccines arrive , " he said .

fraunhofer 3d screens the institute responsible for the mp3 format has moved on to the third dimension , bringing a plethora of 3d hardware including this incredible screen which displays a 3d image without the need for special glasses .
a camera at the top tracks the position of your eyes to create the effect .
is it a camera , is it a phone ?
here is an example of why the manufacturers of digital cameras are starting to get worried - the new sony ericsson s700 with a 1.3 megapixel camera .
they are calling these handsets " dual front " , as one side looks like a mobile and the other like a camera .
i am sure that by the end of the year they will have broken the 3 megapixel barrier on the mobile phone .
that 's what i call handy the motorola mpx fits snugly in the palm of the hand .
an incredibly versatile pocket pc device with tri-band gsm , gprs , bluetooth and wi-fi all built in .
it will run the soon to be released microsoft windows mobile 2003 second edition , which has the ability to support landscape or portrait usage .
expected to be available around autumn this year .
microsoft gets creative here is the pocket multimedia player we have heard so much about recently .
sporting a 20 or 40 gb hard drive , this beauty can store and play all your pictures , music files and video files , -lrb- in windows wmv format -rrb- .
the screen is gorgeous and it is a lot lighter than i expected .
this one is going to be a hit until apple take their ipod into the video / image world .
pocket convergence everything really is getting smaller and smaller , while at the same time more and more powerful .
at cebit , there are usb flash memory sticks of every description .
this one , which caught my eye , combines mp3 , mpeg-4 video and an mp3 player in one small device .
virtual laser keyboard this ingenious device connects to a pocket pc , palm or windows device and projects a keyboard on any flat surface using a laser .
you can then type using the virtual keys .
it was very responsive and accurate when i tested it , but a shame it does not use bluetooth to connect to the device .
it should be available in the autumn .
virtual engineering siemens shows off more 3d hardware , which as well as providing a heads up display of what you are looking at , actually recognises the component in view , then displays information on it to the headset display .
audi also has shown some recognition devices to help their engineers look like cyber-cyclists too .
celebrity twins swedish company , softhouse , has come with a fun application where you can send a picture to their server by mms and it then uses facial recognition to match your face with a celebrity .
apparently i 'm an 81 % match with brendan fraser .
obviously , it 's him that looks like me , not the other way round .
flip and click new mobiles of all shapes and sizes competed for attention at cebit .
the hall was buzzing with talk of new picture phones , 3g handsets and data phones .
this cameraphone from the people behind japan 's i-mode service , ntt docomo , comes with a snazzy twist-flippable display .
where am i ?
the organisers of cebit know their visitors .
with most of them , like me , armed to the teeth with gadgets , they provide a show guide with maps and info for just about any device you could wish to arrive with .
invaluable for this , the world 's largest technology trade fair .
pocket gigahertz via technologies , responsible for the mini-itx motherboard , which is only 17cm x 17cm , are about to launch the nano-itx .
this one is only 12cm x 12cm in size and has a 1ghz processor built-in .
along with built-in ethernet networking , usb and tv-out , it is sure to be a hit with those wishing to downsize their systems .
it also has hardware mpeg-2 and mpeg-4 decoding with 3d graphics support .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- surgeons want to practise on pigs bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes monday , 22 march , 2004 , 10:17 gmt surgeons want to practise on pigs surgeons say trainees may have to hone their skills by practising operating on pigs and sheep .
the royal college of surgeons -lrb- rcs -rrb- wants laws , which currently limit such operations to rodents , to be relaxed .
it says reductions in the time junior doctors spend practising in operating theatres make the changes essential .
the british union for the abolition of vivisection -lrb- buav -rrb- attacked the plan , saying it was ' ethically and scientifically ' wrong .
the rcs said it had changed its view on the use of animals , which would be terminally anaesthetised during the operations , because of concerns that junior doctors no longer spend enough time in theatre operating . "
current restrictions on the use of terminally anaesthetised animals for training surgeons should be relaxed " sir peter morris their hours have fallen so no junior doctor is now supposed to work more than 56 hours a week , and by 2009 the limit will be 48 hours , in line with european legislation .
sir peter morris , president of the rcs , said the problems this caused were ' enormous ' .
he wants to see the use of both human simulators and live animals .
using animals would be useful as doctors would find handling and dissecting animal tissue and organs to be similar to doing so with human bodies .
a pig 's kidney , for example , is a similar size to a human one .
restrictions sir peter said : " the college does feel now that the current restrictions on the use of terminally anaesthetised animals for training surgeons should be relaxed and extended beyond the use of rodents for training in microsurgery to allow larger animals , such as the pig or sheep , to be used for training in both generic and specific surgical skills . "
however , the buav said the science behind the call was dubious as pigs were not anatomically close enough to humans to be useful .
campaigns director wendy higgins said : ' it is not an area where scientists should have a relaxation of the law .
ethically , the animal 's life is worth more than being used as some kind of disposable surgical tool . '
she said human simulators were now extremely good and that she would welcome a dicussion with the rcs about the issue .

the royal college of surgeons -lrb- rcs -rrb- wants laws , which currently limit such operations to rodents , to be relaxed .
it says reductions in the time junior doctors spend practising in operating theatres make the changes essential .
the british union for the abolition of vivisection -lrb- buav -rrb- attacked the plan , saying it was ' ethically and scientifically ' wrong .
the rcs said it had changed its view on the use of animals , which would be terminally anaesthetised during the operations , because of concerns that junior doctors no longer spend enough time in theatre operating .
current restrictions on the use of terminally anaesthetised animals for training surgeons should be relaxed sir peter morris their hours have fallen so no junior doctor is now supposed to work more than 56 hours a week , and by 2009 the limit will be 48 hours , in line with european legislation .
sir peter morris , president of the rcs , said the problems this caused were ' enormous ' .
he wants to see the use of both human simulators and live animals .
using animals would be useful as doctors would find handling and dissecting animal tissue and organs to be similar to doing so with human bodies .
a pig 's kidney , for example , is a similar size to a human one .
restrictions sir peter said : " the college does feel now that the current restrictions on the use of terminally anaesthetised animals for training surgeons should be relaxed and extended beyond the use of rodents for training in microsurgery to allow larger animals , such as the pig or sheep , to be used for training in both generic and specific surgical skills . "
however , the buav said the science behind the call was dubious as pigs were not anatomically close enough to humans to be useful .
campaigns director wendy higgins said : ' it is not an area where scientists should have a relaxation of the law .
ethically , the animal 's life is worth more than being used as some kind of disposable surgical tool . '
she said human simulators were now extremely good and that she would welcome a dicussion with the rcs about the issue .
