after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niceties first - merkel -lrb- left -rrb- lays a wreath at kemal ataturk 's mausoleum .
after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .

but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .

ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 eu assesses ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president prodi cordially embraces vladimir putin the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .
russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .
the european union is by far and away russia ’ s most important economic and trading partner .
russia has grown to become a key strategic supplier of energy - both natural gas and oil - for the bloc , accounting for over 50 % of current exports .
total trade between russia and the eu reached 78 billion euros -lrb- 99 billion dollars -rrb- in 2003 , with the european union suffering a heavy deficit , largely due to energy imports . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity .

bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 a wider europe in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and other eu border states could one day have a stake in the bloc 's internal market .
german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .
" he ought to do his work at home first .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .

sos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no gerhard , i did n't call you anything .
i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .
" he ought to do his work at home first .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .
-lrb- november 4 , 2003 -rrb- foreign extremist population shrinking in germany the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .

sos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no gerhard , i did n't call you anything .
i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .
the european union is by far and away russia ’ s most important economic and trading partner .
russia has grown to become a key strategic supplier of energy - both natural gas and oil - for the bloc , accounting for over 50 % of current exports .
total trade between russia and the eu reached 78 billion euros -lrb- 99 billion dollars -rrb- in 2003 , with the european union suffering a heavy deficit , largely due to energy imports . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .

sos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no gerhard , i did n't call you anything .
i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .

i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 german opposition stays tough on turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no strangers - merkel -lrb- left -rrb- with turkish premier erdogan last year .
angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .

ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 a wider europe in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and other eu border states could one day have a stake in the bloc 's internal market .
german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets .
-lrb- jan .
9 , 2004 -rrb- turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity .

bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 eu assesses ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president prodi cordially embraces vladimir putin the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .
russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .
the european union is by far and away russia ’ s most important economic and trading partner .
russia has grown to become a key strategic supplier of energy - both natural gas and oil - for the bloc , accounting for over 50 % of current exports .
total trade between russia and the eu reached 78 billion euros -lrb- 99 billion dollars -rrb- in 2003 , with the european union suffering a heavy deficit , largely due to energy imports . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .
" he ought to do his work at home first .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .
-lrb- november 4 , 2003 -rrb- foreign extremist population shrinking in germany the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working .

the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .
-lrb- november 4 , 2003 -rrb- foreign extremist population shrinking in germany the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .

" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .

the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .
" he ought to do his work at home first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 german opposition stays tough on turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no strangers - merkel -lrb- left -rrb- with turkish premier erdogan last year .
angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .

first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets .

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence .

the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .

i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

sos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no gerhard , i did n't call you anything .
i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .

ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 eu assesses ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president prodi cordially embraces vladimir putin the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .
russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .
the european union is by far and away russia ’ s most important economic and trading partner .
russia has grown to become a key strategic supplier of energy - both natural gas and oil - for the bloc , accounting for over 50 % of current exports .
total trade between russia and the eu reached 78 billion euros -lrb- 99 billion dollars -rrb- in 2003 , with the european union suffering a heavy deficit , largely due to energy imports . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .
french president jacques chirac and foreign minister dominique de villepin complained at the german-french summit last week that fischer had n't given them an opportunity to put forward a joint initiative .
both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .
on tuesday , he will be back in berlin , where fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder will receive palestinian authority prime minister ahmed qureia . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , on saturday criticized the ensuing visit .
qureia is a " failed premier , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa , and he had done nothing to fight terror .
" qureia has not dared to confront -lrb- palestinian president -rrb- arafat 's strategy of chaos , " stein said .
" he ought to do his work at home first .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.02.2004 vodafone launches umts service in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mobile connect card makes connections faster but only for laptop users .
after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .

ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.02.2004 vodafone launches umts service in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mobile connect card makes connections faster but only for laptop users .
after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets .

9 , 2004 -rrb- turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .

dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .

3g ...
sos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no gerhard , i did n't call you anything .
i said u ... m ... t ... s " when the first telephone was developed , its aim was to aid communication .
but these days , understanding phones can seem more like a barrier .
dw-world tries to explain a little about what 's going on in telecommunications . for many people , trying to understand third generation mobile phone technology is like a being cast adrift in a rolling sea full of acronyms and technical data .
however , help is at hand for technophobes everywhere as dw-world attempts to throw a lifeline to those drowning in confusion by answering these frequently asked questions in our " dummies guide to 3g . "
what is third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phone technology ?
first generation networks provided simple analogue voice telephony ; second -lrb- current -rrb- generation added some data services like fax and e-mail to basic voice service , with higher rate data capabilities expected over the next few years .
the third generation of mobile telecommunications should be capable of providing data rates of up to 2 megabits per second , in addition to conventional voice , fax and data services .
this offers the prospect of high-resolution video and multimedia services on the move , such as mobile office services , virtual banking and on-line billing , home shopping , video conferencing , on-line entertainment and internet access .
basically , it 's faster and offers a lot more extras .
what is umts ?
umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- is an acronym to describe a 3g system which will be used in europe and elsewhere .
the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- is coordinating the international harmonization of standards for 3g , working towards the concept of a family of standards -lrb- imt 2000 -rrb- which can all work together , rather than a single standard .
so eventually umts users in europe will be able to use 3g technology all over the world under a different banner .
this ability to use devices on different networks is called roaming and will be made possible by satellite and land based networks .
i hear about gsm and gprs .
what does it all mean ?
gsm stands for global system for mobile communications .
gsm is the name of a land mobile pan-european digital cellular communications system .
gprs stands for general packet radio service which is a so-called packet-switched gsm data service .
this means it is a network in which information is transferred between subscribers .
the phone basically changes from one gprs network to another without any circuits being set up .
what are 1g , 2g , 2.5g , 3g and 4g ? 1g networks are considered to be the first analog cellular systems , which started in the early 1980 's and followed on from radio telephone systems .
2g networks are the first digital cellular systems launched in the early 1990 's .
2.5g networks -lrb- e.g. gprs -rrb- are the enhanced versions of 2g networks with data rates up to about 144kbit / s .
3g networks -lrb- umts and the others included in imt 2000 -rrb- are the latest cellular networks that have data rates 384kbit / s and more .
4g is mainly a marketing buzzword at the moment .
some basic 4g research is being done , but no frequencies have been allocated .
the forth generation could be ready for implementation around 2012 .
how is umts different from current second generation networks ?
umts offers the following : a higher speech quality than current networks .
in addition to speech traffic , umts together with advanced data and information services offers a multimedia network .
umts is above 2g mobile systems for its potential to support 2mbit / s data rates .
umts is a real global system , comprising both terrestrial and satellite components .
it provides a consistent service environment even when roaming via " virtual home environment " -lrb- vhe -rrb- .
a person roaming from his network to other umts operators will experience a consistent set of services , thus " feeling " like his home network , independent of the location or access mode -lrb- satellite or terrestrial -rrb- .
are 2g systems such as gsm / gprs networks compatible with umts networks ?
umts networks can be operated with gsm / gprs networks .
systems use different frequency bands , so mobiles , in theory , should not interfere with each other .
umts specification is designed so that there is maximum compatibility between gsm and umts systems .
the new vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs laptop data card allows users to swap back to gprs systems when a umts network is not available and is one of the first applications to provide this long talked about service . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niceties first - merkel -lrb- left -rrb- lays a wreath at kemal ataturk 's mausoleum .
after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .

both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .

german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations . accusations of anti-semitism were meant to take a backseat at an israeli conference on the eu 's " wider europe " program , a welcome change less than a month after the latest row over european anti-semitism . but they 're likely to remain on the agenda . german foreign minister joschka fischer and his spanish and belgian colleagues arrived in herzliya , near tel aviv , for a conference on upgrading the eu 's relations to the countries that will border the enlarged union . the " wider europe " program is meant to encourage the eu 's neighbors to cooperate politically and economically with the union .
the eastern european and mediterranean countries that implement political , economic and legislative reforms agreed on with the eu will be able to reap rewards , such as stakes in the eu 's internal market and , ultimately , the " free exchange of persons , goods , services and capital . " in herzliya , fischer said he hoped the israeli government would rethink the positioning of a fence meant to protect israel from suicide bombers .
construction of the fence has been internationally criticized as it would run deep into palestinian territory in some areas , separating children and schools , farmers and fields , patients and hospitals . fischer is expected to expand on his call for a new plan for middle east peace that would give nato a central role along with the eu and the arab states .
" in order to succeed , the european union and the u.s. should , in view of this major challenge to our common security , pool their capabilities , assets and projects to form a new transatlantic initiative for the middle east , " fischer said at an international security conference in munich a week ago . on monday , fischer said palestinian president yasser arafat should not be pushed aside as demanded by israel since palestinians should be able to choose their leaders themselves . going solo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer during a visit to tel aviv , in april 2003 .
apparently , fischer failed to consult his european colleagues before making the proposal for a new road map .

both the french and the spanish were annoyed that the german encroached on a subject - eu-mediterranean policies - that has traditionally been their domain , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its monday issue . the herzliya conference also plans to address misunderstandings between europe and israel , which have been particularly numerous in the past half year . the european union has criticized the security fence , and relations have also been troubled by allegations of european anti-semitism for months .
the conflicts over anti-semitism started in november , after an eu poll was published that said some 60 percent of europeans believed israeli was the greatest threat to world peace .
israeli politicians , including prime minister ariel sharon , accused europe of inherent anti-semitism . criticism from israeli ambassador fischer is also scheduled to meet with israeli foreign minister sirvan shalom during his brief visit to the country .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .
in may , 10 countries will join the union .
they include cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia . despite their differences , erdogan and merkel agreed to expand ties between the cdu and erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , is expected to visit turkey next week .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .
with merkel overwhelmingly associated with anti-turkish sentiment as far as ankara ’ s bid for eu membership goes , the german conservative leader ’ s two-day trip to turkey is expected to be far from easy .
no full eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan but so far merkel has shown no signs of softening her tough stance .
in talks with turkish prime minister recep tayip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , she is expected to underline her party ’ s staunch opposition to the eu opening the door to turkey – a view she reiterated just hours before her departure to ankara in a television interview .
" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .
no to populist line but one thing that merkel will find difficult to justify is her party ’ s and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union ’ s , decision to make turkey ’ s eu bid a major electoral plank in european parliament polls in june .
" an inner-party political election campaign over turkey ’ s eu membership should not be allowed to take place in germany , " erdogan has warned .
even turkey ’ s ambassador to germany , ali irtemcelik , has cautioned against abusing his country ’ s bid for eu membership for electioneering purposes .
on monday he told a german newspaper that turkey was well aware of the fact that a full membership would take many years to complete and warned it would be irresponsible to stir resentment against germany ’ s turks for the sake of short-term gains at the polls . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's leader visits berlin 's " little istanbul " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

9 , 2004 -rrb- turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .
" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .
critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity .

bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .

critics of the security warning codes have claimed that perpetual states of " hot orange " have not helped the public remain vigilant but in fact have made many weary through panic and increased anxiety . german collaboration also lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bka has been more involved in anti-terror activities in recent months .
on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity . " csu minister calls for more extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein .
bavarian minister of the interior günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- voiced his wish for a strengthening of the anti-terror laws .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister told the congress : " we need first to improve the centralization of data and the identification of certain people , especially from the near- and middle east , and secondly , to ensure that those dangerous ones which are among us are expelled before they can make something concrete . " schily also spoke of the " threat from within , " referring to the continued search in germany of suspected terrorists and organizations charged with inciting violence .
one means of preventing an idea escalating to violent action is to ban radical organizations such as cologne 's " caliphate state " run by the turkish islamist leader metin kaplan . the return of the caliph of cologne ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne .
schily 's reference to the self-appointed " caliph of cologne , " the man already charged with calling for the murder of a rival , comes as evidence of a possible revival in kaplan 's activities has surfaced : propaganda materials similar to those found in a raid of his headquarters in december are once again circulating . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security measures against foreign extremists still necessary more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .
however , schily made it clear that his own country would not follow the united states and set up a terror warning system in line with steps introduced by the u.s. department for homeland security .

angela merkel , head of germany 's christian democrats , is in ankara to discuss turkey 's eu bid .
her party opposes full membership for the largely muslim nation , and has instead called for a special eu partnership . on monday the leader of germany 's conservative opposition is expected to meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minster abdullah gül to discuss the country 's application for membership to the 15-nation eu bloc .
but given the fact that the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been vocally opposed to turkey entering the eu , merkel 's views are unlikely to be well received in ankara .
privileged partnership instead of full membership on the eve of her two-day visit , merkel stressed in a german television interview that the cdu remains against full eu membership for turkey , but is in favor of a special privileged eu-turkey partnership .
" we should be honest with each other , " merkel said .
she acknowledged that turkey naturally had a european perspective , and added , " we ’ re offering it a privileged partnership . "
merkel explained that with the upcoming expansion of the eu , the bloc is already facing " massive problems . "
the inclusion of 10 new , mainly former communist eastern european countries is placing a great strain on brussels , she said .
in light of the budgetary problems that will inevitably arise with eu expansion , merkel added , " we know what it would mean if an additional 25 million turkish farmers came along . "
the cdu leader said it was best not to mince words on the issue .
" one can live with differences of opinion among friends , " she stressed .
turkish eu bid a divisive issue in germany with some two million turks , germany has the largest turkish minority in the european union - a fact that has made turkey ’ s eu bid a divisive issue among german politicians .
while chancellor gerhard schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security , the opposition insists that turkey with its predominantly muslim population and its radically different cultural and religious sensibilities would jar with european reality .
" we should not give turkey any false promises , because then there will be disappointment , " merkel said last month at a congress of the european people ’ s party -lrb- epp -rrb- , which brings together conservative parties from across the eu .
" we want a special partnership , a third way with turkey , because for security and geopolitical reasons it is very important for us to have very close relations with turkey , " she said .
german conservatives have now announced that the issue of turkey ’ s membership will play a pivotal role in european parliament elections in june .
membership talks still distant for turkey turkey first sought to join the bloc in 1963 , but has yet to start accession talks with the eu which cites human rights as the main concern blocking negotiations .

german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism . speaking at the european police congress in bonn on monday , german interior minister otto schily demanded more collaboration between european states and their security forces in the fight against international terrorism , calling specifically for an improvement in the flow of information and more concerted efforts in border control . schily referred to the proposed european database plan where information on terror suspects and their networks could be shared .
the german interior ministry and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- currently have 182 preliminary proceedings and investigations under way against suspects with islamist links within europe .
schily used the point to underline the task at hand and how mutual access to data banks could spread such knowledge between forces .
" we must improve communication as a whole , " he said . in his opening speech to the 600 delegates , schily criticized eu efforts for being too long-winded and laborious and added that the eu 's action plan in fighting international terrorism must be extended .
he encouraged those present to join together to push for improvements in the decision making processes and in the execution of initiatives . no u.s.-style warning system for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. terror warnings have regularly been increased from yellow to orange .

" we must be very aware that we do nothing to panic people while maintaining the utmost vigilance , " schily said . cities in the united states have a color coded warning system which moves towards red as the perceived terror threat increases .

on a domestic note , schily turned his attentions to the german security services which he claimed represented a microcosm of the overall european problem of lack of cooperation .
schily called for a stronger collaboration between all german security services after the alliance of german detectives recently criticized the anti-terror-law package put forward by the interior ministry . the alliance has come out in opposition to parts of the package which it feels are built on very shaky legal grounds .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a law within the ministry 's anti-terror package permits german authorities to ban any extremist group if it can be proven that it spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and such activities are deemed a threat to national security . schily explained that collaboration between the bka , the police , the foreign and interior ministries and the department of justice as well as the office of the federal chancellor must be improved " in such a way , that we can come to the same answer and strategic analysis so we can carry out precisely what is needed at the earliest opportunity .

" this has n't been part of the discussions and it wo n't become part of the discussions , " the turkish leader said .
he also cautioned german conservatives not to make turkey 's eu membership bid a campaign issue during this year 's european parliamentary elections .
" turkey should not be used in a political power struggle , " erdogan said . according to news reports , merkel said that her party would mention the turkey 's eu bid during the upcoming elections in a rational way .
she added that she did n't believe turkey could become a full member of the union in the foreseeable future .
merkel said that she saw the offer to negotiate a " privileged partnership " as a way to keep close ties between turkey and the eu . merkel blames proposed delay on eu expansion christian democrats had no desire to close the door on turkey , said merkel , who acknowledged the country 's " dramatic " reform progress during the last few months .
she added that her party did not see the eu as a " club of christians . " in addition , germany 's unofficial opposition leader said the eu 's current expansion was the main reason why turkey could not be admitted any time soon .
" i see this as a problem for us in the eu , " merkel said .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia europe -pipe- 16.02.2004 eu assesses ties with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president prodi cordially embraces vladimir putin the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .
russia for its part has presented a wish list for brussels . the commission , the european union 's executive body , noted in a statement on monday that " in many areas , including ratification of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reduction , the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreement pca to the ten states set to join the eu in may of this year , european union and russian positions appear to have diverged , " despite their " interdependence . "
the european commission statement came as a response to a request from european leaders in december to draw up an assessment report on all aspects of the union 's relations with russia and to propose measures aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership .
the statement stressed that once agreement is reached on the extension of the pca to the new member states , the eu should be ready to demonstrate its " strong commitment to fostering good relations with russia " with the aim of agreeing to the broad outline of an action plan with russia at a summit in may .
russia submits demands to eu for its part , russia is refusing to transfer the pca that has applied so far to new members , fearing disadvantages in trade with its neighboring states .
it recently submitted a 14-point list containing demands for increased import quotas for grain and steel to the eu .
in addition , moscow said brussels should provide financial aid to the building up of the russian exclave of kaliningrad , which starting on may 1st will be completely surrounded by eu territory .
ethnic russians in estonia and latvia - two of the accession countries - should be given more rights , and russian citizens should be able to travel to eu countries without a visa , the kremlin requested .
officials in brussels rejected moscow 's demands , saying the extension of the validity area of the partnership and cooperation agreement that russia signed with the eu in 1997 was merely a legal formality and not open to negotiation .
eastern european states set to join the eu were less diplomatic , accusing russia of blackmail .
the european union is by far and away russia ’ s most important economic and trading partner .
russia has grown to become a key strategic supplier of energy - both natural gas and oil - for the bloc , accounting for over 50 % of current exports .
total trade between russia and the eu reached 78 billion euros -lrb- 99 billion dollars -rrb- in 2003 , with the european union suffering a heavy deficit , largely due to energy imports . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .

after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains . the turkish press left no doubt what it thought of angela merkel ’ s visit to the country on monday .
" she ’ s only coming to say no " , mass-selling daily milliyet explained to its readers .
a tiny photo of merkel was also buried on page 16 of the paper , an indication that hardly anyone in turkey knows the name of germany ’ s leader of the opposition christian democrats .
" hayir " or " no " was also the most common reaction heard on istanbul ’ s streets from those who had some inkling of the german politician .
" angela merkel ?
no , no - let ’ s see ... she ’ s against turkey ’ s eu membership , cdu , right ? " said one passerby .

" at this point we see the european union being overburdened , in other words we ’ re skeptical about taking in turkey , " merkel said .
merkel , whose party has mainly cited turkey ’ s predominantly muslim population as a reason for wanting to keep it out of the 15-nation overwhelmingly christian bloc , has instead proposed a so-called third way in the form of a " privileged partnership " between turkey and the eu .
but it ’ s a compromise that ’ s unlikely to find much resonance among the majority of turks , many of whom already have cultural and familial affiliations to neighboring europe .
around two million turks live in germany , making it the biggest turkish minority in the european union .
turkish prime minister erdogan said in the run-up to merkel ’ s visit that it made him " sad " to hear the argument that turkey didn ’ t fit into the eu because it was " culturally different . "
erdogan added , " we don ’ t see a cultural unity in europe , no christian club and also no geographical whole . "
a chance for turkey in europe instead turkey has argued it sees a political and strategic chance for itself in europe as well as serving as a bridge between the eu and the islamic world .
turkey is also making efforts to implement reforms and clean up its poor human rights record to meet eu criteria .
to coincide with merkel ’ s visit to a christian community in ankara , turkey has also issued a legal work and residency permit for the first german priest in the country , spelling an end to the murky dealings governing such processes till now .

after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service . the much anticipated arrival of third generation telecommunications technology will get underway in europe now that the vodafone group launched its commercial umts service in britain . customers will be able to switch between the carrier ’ s gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- network and the higher-speed umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- network on their computers via the vodafone mobile connect 3g / gprs lap top data card , which will operate at data rates of up to 384 kilobits per second .
the service will become available to networks in major cities in germany , italy , the netherlands , portugal , spain and sweden within four weeks of the u.k. launch . it has been a long and expensive path for those telecommunications companies who paid a high price for mobile broadband licenses around europe three years ago and vodafone 's first step into the new wireless market will be seen as the incentive for competitors to roll-out their products in an attempt to stay with the slowly gathering pace . data arrives ten times faster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the introduction of the card will enable vodafone customers to access all their usual office applications like e-mail , calendar and internet at up to ten times the speed of gprs .
this will enable customers with a lap top to work anywhere just as if they are in the office . once the user moves outside 3g network coverage , the 3g / gprs data card automatically switches to vodafone 's gprs network allowing those on the move to " roam " throughout europe while still being connected , albeit at a slower data speed . while laptop users will get a jump on those other customers without them , those customers wanting umts technology on the telephone and palm top devices will have to wait .
the data card will not be immediately available for these products . handset technology continues to hinder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umts is waiting for the phones to catch up .
vodafone has not commented on why there this is so but statements from the country imply that the blame has been placed at the door of the handset manufacturers with current telephony technology apparently not up to standard to cope with umts , the availability of light , low-power phones continuing to be a major challenge facing potential operators . however , vodafone ’ s chief marketing officer peter bamford issued a statement last week saying that the carrier plans to introduce additional devices and services for both business and consumer customers in the second half of this year this year but again this will depend on the availability of quality handsets .
umts costs set to mirror gprs although pricing for the new mobile connect service will vary from country to country , estimates suggest the umts tariffs will be based on the current gprs costs .
in addition , to use the new service , customers must pay for a data card , monthly subscription and transmission usage .
the company 's german subsidiary will offer customers two pricing options : one based on minutes ; the other on data volume .
three different packages for each will be available , all expected to include an initial cost of around € 70 -lrb- $ 89 -rrb- with additional extras based on time or bytes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

the researchers want a moratorium on the use of the heavy trawling gear that gouges coral and sponges from the ocean bottom in search of valuable fish .
some of the coral fields will contain thousands of species and are sometimes called the " rainforests of the deep " .
" bottom trawling is like fishing with bulldozers , " said expert elliot norse .
" it 's devastatingly efficient in one sense ; it 's a way to get fish relatively easily and painlessly , if you do n't mind killing all of the life on the bottom to catch them , " the president of the us marine conservation biology institute told the bbc .
the gear is huge .
nets are armed with steel weights or heavy rollers and destroy everything in their path .
at the cold depths of one to two kilometres , the growth rates of all organisms are incredibly slow and the coral fields have little chance to re-establish themselves .
some of the corals resemble trees - they can be up to 10 metres tall - and some specimens have been found to be almost 2,000 years old .
slow speed " they are sources of future medicines , they are recorders of global climate change because they live so long , and they provide habitat for many other species including some really important commercial fish , " says dr norse .
" they are also exquisitely beautiful organisms . "
it is the big and valuable species - cod , orange roughy , armorhead , grenadier and chilean seabass - that live among the coral that draw the trawlers .
but these fish species , too , can not sustain heavy losses .
the orange roughy , for example , can live to more than a hundred years but takes decades to reach sexual maturity .
scientists have long known about corals and sponges in shallow tropical waters , and discovered deep-sea corals in the 1800s .
but until recently , they did not know that coral forests and sponge reefs are widespread in certain cold and deep ocean habitats , many centred along the edges of continental shelves .
scientists have now discovered deep coral fields in japan , tasmania , new zealand , alaska , british columbia , california , nova scotia , maine , north carolina , florida , colombia , brazil , norway , sweden , uk , ireland and mauritania .
it is clear there are more species of corals in cold and deep ocean waters than in tropical shallows .
different approach " deep-sea corals and sponges are crucial habitat elements for seafloor species , " said dr daniel pauly , of the university of british columbia , in vancouver , canada .
" allowing trawling in coral forests is the worst thing we are doing in the ocean today .
it should be stopped immediately until scientists can determine whether trawling in the deep-sea can be justified anywhere .
" nothing could be dumber than destroying the habitats that depleted fish populations need to recover .
governments must stop pussyfooting around and do something useful . "
marine scientists want to see the current gear substituted with anchored longlines .
these lines , which would be of the length of several hundred metres , would float above the reefs .
their downside is that they could snag corals as they are recovered , but the researchers say this would be infinitely preferable than the current methods employed .
dr martin willison , of dalhousie university , also in canada , said many fishermen he had spoken to recognised the need to move away from bottom trawling .
" the social conditions are such that fishermen ca n't voluntarily stop doing what they are doing because if they do in the absence of regulation , they will be beaten by those who go out and continue to destroy the reefs .
" we need new regulations now .
the fishermen are onside but it 's time for policymakers to get behind this bandwagon . "

the researchers want a moratorium on the use of the heavy trawling gear that gouges coral and sponges from the ocean bottom in search of valuable fish .
some of the coral fields will contain thousands of species and are sometimes called the " rainforests of the deep " .
" bottom trawling is like fishing with bulldozers , " said expert elliot norse .
" it 's devastatingly efficient in one sense ; it 's a way to get fish relatively easily and painlessly , if you do n't mind killing all of the life on the bottom to catch them , " the president of the us marine conservation biology institute told the bbc .
the gear is huge .
nets are armed with steel weights or heavy rollers and destroy everything in their path .
at the cold depths of one to two kilometres , the growth rates of all organisms are incredibly slow and the coral fields have little chance to re-establish themselves .
some of the corals resemble trees - they can be up to 10 metres tall - and some specimens have been found to be almost 2,000 years old .
slow speed " they are sources of future medicines , they are recorders of global climate change because they live so long , and they provide habitat for many other species including some really important commercial fish , " says dr norse .
" they are also exquisitely beautiful organisms . "
it is the big and valuable species - cod , orange roughy , armorhead , grenadier and chilean seabass - that live among the coral that draw the trawlers .
but these fish species , too , can not sustain heavy losses .
scientists want to see a move to longlining the orange roughy , for example , can live to more than a hundred years but takes decades to reach sexual maturity .
scientists have long known about corals and sponges in shallow tropical waters , and discovered deep-sea corals in the 1800s .
but until recently , they did not know that coral forests and sponge reefs are widespread in certain cold and deep ocean habitats , many centred along the edges of continental shelves .
scientists have now discovered deep coral fields in japan , tasmania , new zealand , alaska , british columbia , california , nova scotia , maine , north carolina , florida , colombia , brazil , norway , sweden , uk , ireland and mauritania .
it is clear there are more species of corals in cold and deep ocean waters than in tropical shallows .
different approach " deep-sea corals and sponges are crucial habitat elements for seafloor species , " said dr daniel pauly , of the university of british columbia , in vancouver , canada .
deep corals : beautiful but very slow growing " allowing trawling in coral forests is the worst thing we are doing in the ocean today .
it should be stopped immediately until scientists can determine whether trawling in the deep-sea can be justified anywhere .
" nothing could be dumber than destroying the habitats that depleted fish populations need to recover .
governments must stop pussyfooting around and do something useful . "
marine scientists want to see the current gear substituted with anchored longlines .
these lines , which would be of the length of several hundred metres , would float above the reefs .
their downside is that they could snag corals as they are recovered , but the researchers say this would be infinitely preferable than the current methods employed .
dr martin willison , of dalhousie university , also in canada , said many fishermen he had spoken to recognised the need to move away from bottom trawling .
" the social conditions are such that fishermen ca n't voluntarily stop doing what they are doing because if they do in the absence of regulation , they will be beaten by those who go out and continue to destroy the reefs .
" we need new regulations now .
the fishermen are onside but it 's time for policymakers to get behind this bandwagon . "

he says if london was to host the 2012 olympics , it would be a great opportunity for the area to climb out of the poverty trap . "
i was born in jamaica but came to live in london in 1961 which is where i have lived for the past 43 years .
i have seen london change a great deal over the years .
i remember when i first came here , it was an enormous culture shock .
i arrived in november and the snow was very deep and it was very cold .
one of the first things that struck me about london was the great number of facilities here .
but hackney is one of the poorest inner-city boroughs in london and many parts of it are run-down .
it is in desperate need of regeneration and businesses in hackney are badly in need of assistance too . "
i am confident london can win the -lsb- olympic -rsb- bid if it is given the right assistance ... it is a world-class capital city " errol hines the present situation of businesses in hackney warrants special help from the government .
i believe there should be a designated business zone , in the same way that there are sports zones and art zones .
if london won the olympic bid , hackney would have the opportunity to benefit enormously post-olympics , particularly as a major london venue for events such as rock concerts and other recreational activities , including the possible relocation of a major football , rugby or other world-sporting club .
the olympics would also create an infrastructure for tourism i.e. restaurants , hotels , theatres , cinemas , bowling alleys , to accommodate visitors to the olympics who would otherwise have to visit the west end .
the extension of the east london line to dalston and further east would bring much needed improvements to the local transport links .
i am confident london can win the bid if it is given the right assistance .
it is a world-class capital city .
if we can manage finances as well as we do , surely we can manage the olympics .
although i still see jamaica as my home as i was born there , i have lived in london for so long now that england is really more my home .
and , if i am honest , i can say that i am very proud to be a londoner . "
my london is a series of features about life in the city which will be on news online every monday .

if london won the olympic bid , hackney would have the opportunity to benefit enormously post-olympics , particularly as a major london venue for events such as rock concerts and other recreational activities , including the possible relocation of a major football , rugby or other world-sporting club .
the olympics would also create an infrastructure for tourism i.e. restaurants , hotels , theatres , cinemas , bowling alleys , to accommodate visitors to the olympics who would otherwise have to visit the west end .

the royal institute of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- says the retail sector in the capital is the " big loser " .
its report says 90 % of retailers and 75 % of leisure occupiers view the charge negatively , and believe turnover is suffering as consumers stay away .
but rics says there is little evidence of firms relocating outside the zone .
people are put off buying larger items because they ca n't get them home kim church , gift shop owner the congestion charge was introduced into central london on 17 february , 2003 , in an attempt to cut traffic levels and help ease severely clogged roads .
the scheme , run by transport for london , has also been used to raise money to re-invest in the capital 's transport system .
the area in which charges apply is a zone measuring eight square miles -lrb- 21 square kilometres -rrb- within the inner ring road - the most central and heavily congested part of london .
' huge decline ' one affected retailer is kim church , publisher of in and around covent garden , and who also owns a gift shop located off neals yard , inside the charging zone .
he said : " i 've seen a huge decline in the sale of goods that require transportation other than by a simple carrier bag .
" people are put off buying larger items because they ca n't get them home .
the charge has caused problems for retailers in central london " furthermore my top two suppliers are now refusing to deliver to the shop .
as my shop relies on having varied and specialist stock , if that can no longer be obtained the shop can not continue . "
but rics said the charge has probably had the biggest impact on businesses on the zone boundary , as customers or clients living just outside are unwilling to travel in and pay the charge .
at lewis and lewis vacuum repair and small electrical shop , in marylebone high street , they said since the introduction of the charge takings had dropped on average 20 % below pre-congestion charging levels .
the company owners believes the charge has cut out customers from around primrose hill and st johns wood , located outside the zone .
charge monitored three months into the charge last year , london chamber of commerce found it was having a negative effect on smaller retailers .
but chief executive of rics , louis armstrong said : " the effect on retailers may not be fully felt for years to come , and public transport in london needs sustained attention and investment for the concept of reduced car-use to work . "
however , rics has recommended the effect on retail outlets should be monitored and " consideration given to alterations to the scheme " if trade continues to be hit .
other suggestions are a need to improve all public transport provision in london , a study of the congestion charge on property markets , and careful consideration to any extension to the scheme .
the rics report focused on five areas in and around the zone ; marylebone , soho and covent garden , lambeth and newington , islington and clerkenwell .
it found the congestion charge was having little impact on the residential property market or office space rental .

the future of the £ 43m carmarthenshire attraction has not been secured despite negotiations with interested parties .
now the site 's general manager , dr rhodri griffiths , is warning that march 1 may be set as the date for the venue 's closure .
after a promising start when it opened in 2000 , visitor numbers at the attraction have slumped despite a number of emergency handouts .

" i want to make it absolutely clear that the welsh assembly government will not enter into an open-ended revenue subsidy , nor will we nationalise the garden , " he added .
he has repeatedly said there can not be a " blank cheque " for the garden site .
mr pugh also said that the situation at the gardens was " grave " , with the institution having an overdraft of £ 2m and trade creditors totalling £ 1m .
the millennium commission has also said it will seek to reclaim a £ 21m grant paid to the attraction .
the gardens at llanarthne were opened by the prince of wales three years ago .

cornwall gained european objective one status in 1999 after the county 's official measure of prosperity - known as gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - was shown to be below the trigger level of 75 % of the eu average .
in fact , it was well below that trigger level at 65 % , but figures due to be published later this week show that a year after the european cash started to flow , cornwall 's gdp continued to decline .
the objective one partnership says the figures were taken far too early for the grants to have any real impact , and do not take into account money spent since the end of 2001 .
objective one march 1999 , cornwall & scilly designated as an objective one region criteria : gross domestic product per head of population , was below the threshold of 75 % of the european average £ 300m in european funding available , to be matched by uk funding by the end of 2001 , the count 's gdp was down to just 60 % .
however , karleen kelemen , director of the objective one partnership , said : " these figures do not mean that cornwall 's economy is declining or that it is in depression .
" what they indicate is that , relative to the performance of the rest of europe , cornwall 's economy did not grow as fast in 2001 as it did in 2000 .
" we should also bear in mind that eu averages are distorted by other very high performing areas of europe , such as madrid , which has seen enormous growth . "
she said there were a number of possible reasons for the apparent drop , including the impact of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001 .
there had also been a number of key developments in cornwall since 2001 , including the start flights by airline ryanair at newquay airport .
the eden project , which brings in millions into the cornish economy , had also been open for only nine months by the end of 2001 .
the objective one partnership had spent only £ 7.6m in 2001 , compared with almost £ 100m now .
ms kelemen said : " the benefits of objective one were not felt in 2001 , and because of the long-term nature of the programme , their full impact is unlikely to be felt until at least 2010 .
" cornwall is only three years into what must be seen as a long-term investment programme , so we should not seize on historic data , some of it three years old , and interpret it as indicative of decline . "

the objective one partnership says the figures were taken far too early for the grants to have any real impact , and do not take into account money spent since the end of 2001 .
objective one march 1999 , cornwall & scilly designated as an objective one region criteria : gross domestic product per head of population , was below the threshold of 75 % of the european average £ 300m in european funding available , to be matched by uk funding by the end of 2001 , the count 's gdp was down to just 60 % .
however , karleen kelemen , director of the objective one partnership , said : " these figures do not mean that cornwall 's economy is declining or that it is in depression .
" what they indicate is that , relative to the performance of the rest of europe , cornwall 's economy did not grow as fast in 2001 as it did in 2000 .
" we should also bear in mind that eu averages are distorted by other very high performing areas of europe , such as madrid , which has seen enormous growth . "
she said there were a number of possible reasons for the apparent drop , including the impact of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001 .
there had also been a number of key developments in cornwall since 2001 , including the start flights by airline ryanair at newquay airport .
the eden project , which brings in millions into the cornish economy , had also been open for only nine months by the end of 2001 .
the objective one partnership had spent only £ 7.6m in 2001 , compared with almost £ 100m now .
ms kelemen said : " the benefits of objective one were not felt in 2001 , and because of the long-term nature of the programme , their full impact is unlikely to be felt until at least 2010 .
" cornwall is only three years into what must be seen as a long-term investment programme , so we should not seize on historic data , some of it three years old , and interpret it as indicative of decline . "

angry youths torched a railway station and pelted police with petrol bombs and lumps of concrete in the mainly aborigine district of redfern .
thomas hickey , 17 , died after he was impaled on a metal fence when he fell off his bike .
police deny claims he was being chased by officers at the time .
there are to be three inquiries into the boy 's death and the riot .
four people have been arrested and charged over the riot , which lasted for nine hours .
police say they expect more arrests to follow .
the bbc 's phil mercer in sydney says this was the worst night of violence in sydney for years , and will be a setback for race relations .
new south wales state premier bob carr said his government would launch inquiries into the incident to establish how the teenager died and whether there was any police involvement .
redfern riots riots in pictures the three inquiries will be carried out by the state coroner , the police service and a public affairs watchdog .
local anger the riot broke out on sunday night and continued into the early hours of monday .

the allegation is strongly denied by the police .
a local resident , identified only as donna , told abc radio that people were angry because they believed the police were responsible for the teenager 's death .
" he was murdered .
we 've been down to look at the spot and everything and there 's no sign , they cleaned it up that quick , " she said .
one local community leader accused the police of harassing people who live in a rundown area of housing known as the block .

john boyle , who was 27 and from donegal , was held in the segregation block , which was later the focus of an inquiry into allegations of beatings by prison officers .
lawyers for john boyle 's family have written to detectives urging them to review the matter again .
an inquest jury returned an open verdict on the prisoners ' death .
the inquiry call comes after the home office agreed to pay almost £ 2m compensation to other inmates at wormwood scrubs who had been beaten and subjected to mock hangings .
three officers have been convicted of assault .
anonymous caller the boyle family 's solicitor , daniel machover , said no fresh police inquiry was expected to be launched without new evidence .
he appealed to an anonymous caller who contacted his office in 1999 with information about the case to come forward again .
mr machover told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i think the police will only want to have a look at this if we have got new positive , decent evidence .
" what the family hopes is that the publicity around this case now will bring forward people who have n't yet told the full story of what happened , and possibly the anonymous caller from 1999 . "
mr machover said the family wanted john boyle 's death to be part of any public inquiry into deaths at wormwood scrubs in the 1990s .
investigation ' welcome ' a parliamentary question has also been tabled asking the home secretary for information about the original investigation into john boyle 's death , bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw reports .
john boyle was found hanging in his cell after being restrained by prison officers .
pathologists found evidence of other injuries on his body .
after reviewing their initial investigation into the death , police concluded that that there had been " no impropriety " by prison officers .
the prison officers association said it would welcome a new investigation , as it would help prevent further allegations being made against its members .

big pit - also known as the national mining museum of wales - educates visitors about the industry synonymous with the country 's heritage .
welsh assembly culture minister alun pugh has had a preview of the new-look attraction in blaenavon .
he said people should visit the centre in order to learn about mining .
" big pit is bigger and better then ever , and well worth a visit , " he stressed .
" it 's a great example of how museums can successfully bring the past to life by making the experience as realistic and true-to-life as possible .
special status " wales ' industrial past is an important part of our heritage and history and we can be proud that big pit is so close to the blaenavon world heritage site , " added mr pugh , himself the son of a rhondda miner .
former miner terry mason , now a guide at the pit said : " visitors find it hard to believe that i enjoyed being underground .
there was a camaraderie about it and , without being sexist ... there were no women . "
it is more than three years since blaenavon and the surrounding countryside won world heritage status .
the judges ranked the area alongside the taj mahal and the great barrier reef after agreeing that it contained rare examples of the uk 's industrial heritage .
as a result of big pit 's redevelopment , visitors will be able to see a new haulage house underground and the fan-house on the top of the mine shaft which regulates the air quality .
the pit-head baths have also been refurbished .
the project has been funded by the heritage lottery fund , the wales tourist board , a variety of private trusts and the welsh assembly government .
" big pit continues to be one of wales ' top visitor attractions with over 112,000 visitors last year , " said mr pugh .
" visitor numbers have been boosted by the success of the welsh assembly government 's free admission policy which is helping to ensure that everyone has a chance to enjoy welsh culture and heritage , " he added .
to mark the reopening of big pit , max boyce , one of wales ' favourite entertainers , has been invited to attend .
the comedian will also see for the first time a locker especially dedicated to his successful career .

scarlett johansson is nominated for two film roles us academy members watched the prestigious bafta award for best film being handed out in london on sunday with their usual interest .
but to what degree , if any , will the british academy 's choice have an impact on the oscars two weeks later ?
it could be significant , according to some industry watchers who say this year 's race is more wide open than many have made out .
the return of the king , the final part of peter jackson 's lord of the rings trilogy , is favourite among most commentators to sweep the board in hollywood on 29 february .
big fish has made the best film shortlist it dominated the golden globes - the first major pre-oscars testing ground - and won five bafta awards including best picture .
but if it had been overlooked in london on sunday , oscar voters may have been be swayed away from middle-earth towards something more cinematically realistic , say film experts .
steven gaydos , executive editor of variety movie industry magazine , said : " i think this is an odd year - there is no clear consensus across the board and that 's where the baftas could have some impact .
" you ca n't say lord of the rings is a sure thing at the oscars .
a fantasy film has never won in 76 years , and a lot of people in the acting branches are not impressed .
they will be leaning more towards mystic river , driven more by reality and a social element . "
charles gant , film editor of heat magazine , believed rings would sweep the board at both ceremonies , but said if something else had happened on sunday , it could have made everyone think differently .
jude law is nominated for his acting in cold mountain the baftas are now been staged in advance of the oscars - a move that has dramatically increased their profile and influence in hollywood .
before 2001 , when bafta trailed in oscar 's wake , they were seen as an anti-climax - and would barely have registered among many tinseltown movers and shakers .
now , though , in a turnaround described as an act of " genius " by some observers , bafta helps set the international film agenda and can affect the choice of oscar voters .
it does all this while proudly proclaiming an independence of spirit and maintaining its vital pr role for british movie-making .
actors and film-makers take advantage of the ceremony 's red carpet exposure to give their movies a final push in the run-up to the academy awards .
last year , a-listers such as nicole kidman , meryl streep and julianne moore flew to london to promote their films - with the attendant possibility of swaying undecided academy voters .
peter jackson is up for a prize for directing the return of the king this year , oscar voters will become conscious of who and what bafta chooses to honour a full nine days before their own ballots close .
mr gaydos said it was important for movie stars to show up at the london event .
" everyone is watching the awards season .
we look at all the awards and see how they might be predictors , if the voters would be influenced .
" if 250 critics have said finding nemo is one of the best films of the year , no academy voter is going to ignore that when it comes to choosing the best animated film category . "
mr gant was agreed on the potential impact of the british prizes on hollywood 's jurors .
' endgame ' " bafta is a very good way of catching -lrb- us -rrb- academy members in the uk , " he said .
" having the star come over and attend screenings is the process by which votes are sought .
the endgame is to scoop up academy members . "
this year the voting process on both sides of the atlantic has been hit by the " screener " row - a ban on preview dvds of fancied films for academy voters , instigated by studios fearful of internet piracy .
the ban was later lifted but it led to some voters missing out on seeing certain films .
" bigger companies like warners did n't send out tapes and it meant that mystic river did n't get a nomination because not enough people saw it , " said mr gant .
" i think warner bros missed a trick there . "
whatever and whoever bafta honours , the awards are firmly established as the most glamorous night on the uk entertainment calendar - and an event the world now takes even greater notice of .

fellner and bevan formed their company in 1992 tim bevan and eric fellner have been described as the " brit flick 's twin towers of power " , britain 's " movie moguls " and " gamblers with excellent taste and instincts " .
but whatever tag you want to apply to the two producers and founders of working title films , one thing is certain : the british film industry would be poorer without them .
they have been listed as the most powerful figures in the british industry and in 2002 premiere magazine put them at 41st in the world-wide movie power list .
a roll call of their films is a virtual name check of all of the biggest british films of the last 10 years .
working title hits four weddings bean notting hill bridget jones 's diary their films have grossed more than $ 1.8 billion -lrb- £ 1.12 billion -rrb- in the last 12 years , and that is a conservative estimate .
the financial times reported that the pair are worth at least £ 20m each .
" they are energetic , not naive , not arty-farty , or up their own arses , " said actor hugh grant , who has worked with the pair on four films .
they have not just contributed financially to the industry .
working title films have also backed critically-acclaimed films and american independent successes .
critical successes dead man walking elizabeth fargo the man who was n't there o brother where art thou ?
strangely , for such successful film figures , the two maintain a very low profile at odds with the industry in which they work .
new zealand-born bevan started his career as a production runner on soap opera , close to home , before serving his apprenticeship at the national film unit .
in the early 1980s he moved to britain and started working at video arts , john cleese 's successful corporate training production house .
launch in 1983 he started a music video production company , aldabra , which was to become working title films a year later .
its first feature , my beautiful laundrette , helped launch the careers of director stephen frears and daniel day-lewis .
when you talk to one , you always feel you are talking to the other one as well stephen daldry fellner too started in music videos , making promos for bands such as duran duran and fleetwood mac .
he moved into british films , producing the rachel papers and sid and nancy , among others at initial pictures .
he left initial to join bevan in 1992 .
the early films were a mixture of left-of-centre independent films , such as sammy and rosie get laid , and support for american indie productions , such as tim robbins ' bob roberts .
working title 's breakthrough hit was 1994 's four weddings and a funeral , a romantic comedy which made the term british blockbuster seem less of an oxymoron .
grant has been a regular performer for working title after a long dry period with few international hits , the production company proved that the british could once again fashion films with global appeal .
international successes followed : among them , french kiss , dead man walking , fargo , bean and elizabeth , mixing critical with commercial successes .
in 1999 working title signed a reported $ 600m deal with film giant universal .
while the overall deal is probably exaggerated , it gave the pair the power to commission films with a budget up to $ 35m without even consulting their pay masters .
epicentre " i think anyone in hollywood would want to do business with these guys , " said the former universal studios boss edgar bronfman jr , now a chief executive with usa interactive .
they have fashioned success despite being thousands of miles away from the epicentre of the industry .
but their relationship with hollywood has always been strong .
bridget jones was an international hit director alex cox has spoken of how fellner , in a bid to keep the film straight to hell on track , flew to los angeles and returned with a suitcase of money .
but not all of their films have been unqualified successes - as one would expect in the movie industry .
flops include captain corelli 's mandolin .
it was their most expensive film and , ironically , the one that seemed most likely to succeed .
adapted from the widly popular book of the same name , with an all-star cast , it still managed to disappoint with the critics and at the box office .
despite their low profile , bevan is seen as the " flashier " of the two , with more commercial instincts .
although this probably stems from a " celebrity marriage " to joely richardson , which ended in divorce , and once being listed by tatler magazine as one of the most " dateable boys " .
fellner , predictably , is seen as the more arty of the partnership .
" they cover each other and complement each other , " stacey snider , chairman of universal pictures has said .
she added : " tim has incredible drive and focus , while eric can smooth ruffled feathers anytime .
and they 're both material driven , which is rare . "
their most recent success is the launch of wt2 , an offshoot designed to produce smaller budget films .
its first film , billy elliot , was a huge success .
director stephen daldry said : " the joy of them is that they strangely never contradict each other , and despite the fact that they have different personalities , they are in agreement .
when you talk to one , you always feel you are talking to the other one as well . "

fellner and bevan formed their company in 1992 tim bevan and eric fellner have been described as the " brit flick 's twin towers of power " , britain 's " movie moguls " and " gamblers with excellent taste and instincts " .
but whatever tag you want to apply to the two producers and founders of working title films , one thing is certain : the british film industry would be poorer without them .
they have been listed as the most powerful figures in the british industry and in 2002 premiere magazine put them at 41st in the world-wide movie power list .
a roll call of their films is a virtual name check of all of the biggest british films of the last 10 years .
working title hits four weddings bean notting hill bridget jones 's diary their films have grossed more than $ 1.8 billion -lrb- £ 1.12 billion -rrb- in the last 12 years , and that is a conservative estimate .
the financial times reported that the pair are worth at least £ 20m each .
" they are energetic , not naive , not arty-farty , or up their own arses , " said actor hugh grant , who has worked with the pair on four films .
they have not just contributed financially to the industry .
working title films have also backed critically-acclaimed films and american independent successes .
critical successes dead man walking elizabeth fargo the man who was n't there o brother where art thou ?
strangely , for such successful film figures , the two maintain a very low profile at odds with the industry in which they work .
new zealand-born bevan started his career as a production runner on soap opera , close to home , before serving his apprenticeship at the national film unit .
in the early 1980s he moved to britain and started working at video arts , john cleese 's successful corporate training production house .
launch in 1983 he started a music video production company , aldabra , which was to become working title films a year later .
its first feature , my beautiful laundrette , helped launch the careers of director stephen frears and daniel day-lewis .
when you talk to one , you always feel you are talking to the other one as well stephen daldry fellner too started in music videos , making promos for bands such as duran duran and fleetwood mac .
he moved into british films , producing the rachel papers and sid and nancy , among others at initial pictures .
he left initial to join bevan in 1992 .
the early films were a mixture of left-of-centre independent films , such as sammy and rosie get laid , and support for american indie productions , such as tim robbins ' bob roberts .
working title 's breakthrough hit was 1994 's four weddings and a funeral , a romantic comedy which made the term british blockbuster seem less of an oxymoron .
grant has been a regular performer for working title after a long dry period with few international hits , the production company proved that the british could once again fashion films with global appeal .
international successes followed : among them , french kiss , dead man walking , fargo , bean and elizabeth , mixing critical with commercial successes .
in 1999 working title signed a reported $ 600m deal with film giant universal .
while the overall deal is probably exaggerated , it gave the pair the power to commission films with a budget up to $ 35m without even consulting their pay masters .
epicentre " i think anyone in hollywood would want to do business with these guys , " said the former universal studios boss edgar bronfman jr , now a chief executive with usa interactive .
they have fashioned success despite being thousands of miles away from the epicentre of the industry .
but their relationship with hollywood has always been strong .
bridget jones was an international hit director alex cox has spoken of how fellner , in a bid to keep the film straight to hell on track , flew to los angeles and returned with a suitcase of money .
but not all of their films have been unqualified successes - as one would expect in the movie industry .
flops include captain corelli 's mandolin .
it was their most expensive film and , ironically , the one that seemed most likely to succeed .
adapted from the widly popular book of the same name , with an all-star cast , it still managed to disappoint with the critics and at the box office .
despite their low profile , bevan is seen as the " flashier " of the two , with more commercial instincts .
although this probably stems from a " celebrity marriage " to joely richardson , which ended in divorce , and once being listed by tatler magazine as one of the most " dateable boys " .
fellner , predictably , is seen as the more arty of the partnership .
" they cover each other and complement each other , " stacey snider , chairman of universal pictures has said .
she added : " tim has incredible drive and focus , while eric can smooth ruffled feathers anytime .
and they 're both material driven , which is rare . "
their most recent success is the launch of wt2 , an offshoot designed to produce smaller budget films .
its first film , billy elliot , was a huge success .
director stephen daldry said : " the joy of them is that they strangely never contradict each other , and despite the fact that they have different personalities , they are in agreement .

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university villagers in the indian state of gujarat provide food for thought on one of the biggest economic issues of the century , as economist kaushik basu finds .
after driving from gujarat 's commercial capital , ahmedabad , for four hours , the highway meanders into a narrower , bumpier road and the landscape is flat and parched .
this is the edge of the salt deserts of kutch in gujarat .
the vegetation consists of the ubiquitous babul , a shrub-like plant that spreads all the way to the horizon .
the babul , i am told , is not natural to this region .
it was planted by some government officials to stop the spread of the desert , and has been fighting a losing battle ever since .
desolate village for the inhabitants of the region , survival depends on a life of perennial foraging for water and firewood .
but there is another activity for those who have the skill .
that is embroidery , especially mirror work , stitched into fabric . "
to take a one sided view on globalisation seems wrong " i am going to jakotra , where i will stay at the house of one such craftsperson , dohiben .
jakotra is a poor , desolate village , in the middle of nowhere .
by the time we arrive there it is night .
at dawn a winter mist hangs low over the dusty village roads and cows and goats stir languorously .
the womenfolk are out in their ornate , embroidered clothes , bare feet , and sets of three progressively smaller pots on their heads , in search of water .
over the next two days , in jakotra and manipur , outside ahmedabad , i talk to a number of village artisans about their precarious lives .
they are producing enormously labour-intensive handicrafts and barely making ends meet .
my thoughts turn inevitably to globalisation and its effect on such poor people .
it is a subject that one week later would be roundly castigated at the world social forum in bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong .
the reason why artisans like dohiben are better off today than 10 years ago -lrb- and they readily admit this -rrb- is because of the merits of globalisation .
if they had to sell their products only in the neighbouring villages , the demand would be tiny and prices abysmally low .
this is true at a more macro level as well .
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of india 's globalisation .
villagers ' fears research by tirthankar roy and maureen liebl shows that the export of handicrafts has surged since the reforms of 1991 , with its share in india 's manufacturing exports rising from two percent to 5 % during the last decade .
the number of people employed in the handicrafts exports sector grew from just under four and a half million to nearly 10 million over the same period .
at the same time sitting in jakotra i could not dismiss the palpable anxiety of the villagers that they will eventually be out-competed by mechanized , large-scale manufacturers from far and wide .
the indian government used to guard against this risk by declaring that certain products must only be produced in the small-scale sector .
such policies may have been fine earlier but is folly in today 's global village , since other nations can go for cheap , large-scale production of those goods and export them to india .
so although globalisation has so far served the handicrafts sector well , there is no denial that some of these products will come under attack and india will not be able to ward that off .
action plan unless one is a market fundamentalist , one is forced to confront the question : what should the government do ?
first , it will have to spread education so that workers are able to shift from one sector to another as demand shifts .
second , it will have to provide a system of social security to protect the poor against new competition and adjustment unemployment .
instead of opposing globalisation or leaving it all to the market , pressure should be put on government for those kinds of limited interventions which provide shelter for the groups at risk .
such a policy is pragmatic .
globalisation and technological progress are the outcome of individual actions of millions of people .
it is doubtful if there is any government , organisation or corporation that can stall it , certainly not the governments of south asia .
this being so , it is better to channel india 's energy to counter its possible negative fall-out .
to pit oneself against a phenomenon where one has no chance against it is to court failure .
as oscar wilde said on his deathbed in a drab hotel room : " this wallpaper is terrible .
either it goes or i do . "
to read kaushik basu 's future columns , bookmark bbcnews.com / southasia here is a selection of comments about this article .
the situation has improved greatly since india began liberalising in 1991- poverty rates are falling , the economy is growing well and gdp per capita is on the rise too .
however , too much of the benefits remain for the upper middle and corporate classes of india .
the poor , the most downtrodden still remain bereft of most of the benefits globalisation can bring .
india 's prosperity should be judged not on how many people are below $ 1 / day , but how many people have two meals , a job and a home .
aruni , india refreshing to read an indian expert balances concern for social welfare with a keen understanding of the benefits and challenges of globalisation .
i wish the many so called ' intellectuals ' in india who have made careers and fortunes out of castigating globalisation had the wit to understand mr basu 's comments instead of indulging in the usual meaningless rethoric whilst playing into the hands of trade protectionists and anti-capitalists .
h s trivedi , uk globalisation is the best phenomenon south asia experienced ever since discovering zero .
no doubt about that .
there are too many success stories .
if not for globalisation how could sri lanka ever survive from a 20-year-long war that had virtually ruined its economy ?
if not for globalisation how could india became the high church of it in the whole world instead of being confined to its self-imposed wheel chair ?
if not for globalisation , how can we talk so high about the bangladesh and nepal becoming key business players in the region ?
let us not mince words .
it ¿ s a fact .
the only way south asia could make its mark in the world map is by providing the products and services it produces to the international market , by taking the best use of the environment created by the forces of globalisation .
chanuka wattegama , sri lanka the views put forward by kaushik basu apply especially to low-income nations whose integration into global product markets can be either beneficial or disastrous .
most of the workforce are employed in the production of low-wage and labour intensive goods and must compete with other countries for markets in developed countries .
although employment and production levels in such sectors may rise , eventually the phenomenon called ' immiserizing growth ' is a real possibility unless they are able to maintain their competitiveness through upgrading -lrb- mainly by moving up the value chain -rrb- .
furthermore , the rise of new trade rules on labour and the environment poses a danger as the rise of new forms of non-trade barriers and ' credence goods ' characteristics attest .
the reality jeopardizes the chance for low income producers who depend on such goods for their daily survival .
eventually , developing nations must improve the quality of their workforce and move up the value chain quickly or find new areas of ' comparative advantage ' that must be translated into ' competititve advantage ' .
shyamal k shrestha , nepal it seems like a preposterous argument that the best way to develop is to isolate our selves from the world .
globalisation like the market forces are a matter of fact that we must deal with , just like communists where completely off the track when they ignored the marketfoces , just as completeley off the track are nationalists when it comes to globalisation .
but beware of the european left , they are false friends that fight to keep their jobs in europe and from the asians .
they could not care less about our welfare .
sanjay , sweden change is implicit with globalization = and like change in any situation , some -lrb- if not most -rrb- of it is good and some bad .
fighting change - which is what the anti-globalization movement is about- can only result in stagnation .
that is hardly an optimal outcome .
vijay dandapani , usa i agree .
the government specially needs to prepare the nation for the downturn which is speedy at times and the workforce has to be flexible rather as part of their psyche .
protectionism , either by the state or the labor force has to be reigned in .
but there will be a human cost .
only preparedness will soften the blow .
somesguha , usa i am pained to read this article , not by the pitiable condition of the artisans living in india , but by the pathetic solutions offered by the learned economist .
these are the ideas of 20 or maybe 30 years ago of a socialist indian mindset .
where is the creativity of the new age ?
i thought , we produced better economists than that , or maybe you picked one from the wrong bunch .
how can you solve every problem by completely putting the responsibility on the government .
for how long can the government sustain every poor group in our country of more than a billion people .
combined with the latest technologies with their talents , indian industry can beat anybody in the world .
apoorva mathur , india i think there is some misconception about what anti-globalisation campaigners are saying .
although some are very hard-core the vast majority are not really against globalisation per se , but what company owners are doing -lrb- shutting down plants in the western countries and moving them elsewhere , leaving millions unemployed only to sell them back what they used to make themselves ; opening factories in poorer countries , exploiting child labour and paying ridiculously low wages .
that 's something they would n't dare do in the west -rrb- , against the imf and world bank -lrb- who impose draconian measures against countries who ask them for funds to finance their economic recovery -rrb- .
i do n't think any anti-globalisation campaigners are against handicrafts .
if you argue so you have a very twisted view of reality .
so please apply to yourself what you wrote : " to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong . "
norberto amaral , portugal india , like all developing countries has to tread the path to globalisation very carefully .
the pressure is on to open up the markets - and to what end ?
the wto wants developing nations to open up the agriculture sector so that the west can send in billions of dollars worth of highly subsidised food .
does this make sense ?
no .
the local farmers will starve and the affected countries become dependent on the rich farmers .
why do n't the rich countries get rid of the subsidies .
the wto should have a formula which looks at the income per capita increase for the poor countries .
set a target and a time-frame to achieve those targets .
then the whole world will know if globalisation is working. anil joshi , uk i am from the same part of gujrat -lrb- kutch -rrb- that you referred to in your article .
i am proud of the achievement of people from this region despite all obstacles .
you have touched an issue that is at heart of globalization .
your proposal of pragmatic solution is the right way for a country like india .
most people would agree that india can gain large benefit from globalization if correct policies and better execution is put in place .
i think the best way to achieve significant results are by creating an environment which fosters growth .
the main obstacle in india is still its centralized planning model .
when india will decentralize its development effort to local level , it will achieve its fullest potential .
this can be achieve by puting in simple policy of allowing local government to decide , collect and utilize taxes as appropriate to their local requirement .
this will create competition among local communities and india would be on greater development path .
bottom line , give power to local communites and then relax and watch the growth .
shailesh gala , usa i completely agree with prof basu .
globalisation is a force here to stay and in a way i believe india is best positioned to take advantage of this phenomenon .
in the short term it might negatively affect the underprevileged but in the long term it has the potential of integrating merit to markets in the most productive manner .
so we have to ensure that , while going from the short term to the long term , we do n't leave behind people not armed to resist the negative onslught of globablisation .
looking forward to more enlightening articles from prof basu. thanks kunal munjal , ny , usa generally globalisation is good for india and the region but it needs to be supported by good governmence.beside this people need to be educated on how globalisation works and how they can benefit from it .
i think the era of self suffiency and socialist policies are over in india and now the government should focus on how they can use globalisation to improve the life quality of massess .
suresh johnpillai , sri lanka / norway good article , but how about telling the same to us and uk .
why do all western economists and countries tell us to open up ... for the first time india has a little advantage on outsourcing and look at the reaction of the west ! ! ! ! !
such hypocrisy .
ajit khanna , india globalisation is the driving force behind the paradigm shift that is taking place right now .
no one is going to be able to resist this change , and it will bring the true global village encompassing the regions nationalistic , economic , religious and political movements .
thiru k , nj , usa the unfettered spread of free markets and technology to the developing world will provide higher standards of living as it has done in every country that has embraced a globalized economy .
david voigt , sacramento , california very insightful !
i 've always been an avid reader of dr. kaushik basu 's writing .
hasan faruq , bangladesh i believe mr basu is right .
globalization is inevitable and it has benefitted various sectors of the indian economy by providing employment for many who are a part of the export industry .
however , i do not agree with those who believe that globalization and free markets are the answer to world poverty and that opening up of markets has made the lives of the poor better .
yes , they are better off and some of the wealth has trickled down , but the important question is , how much ?
if they make a couple of dollars more each day because they produce for the global market , is that justified in comparison to the billions of dollars that mncs and industries make in the form of profits ?
i do n't think so .
if the government really believes in improving the lives of the rural poor , they need to step in and offer security and better standards and prices .
and , mncs who believe that they are providing better alternatives for the poor by offering low-wage jobs need to do more than that-again , by offering better wages , working conditions and health standards for their workers .
ultimately , i think , everyone profits from socially- and environmentally-just policies .
mridula swamy , india it is very well for someone like kaushik basu to make his ivory tower judgements about indian village life , but the kind of " limited intervention " he would like to see by the government has been the first casuality of globalization .
spending on health and education have never been lower in india , and welfare in the form of unemployment benefits has never existed .
this is one of the key issues taken up by critics of globalization , and a few success stories like the sale of indian handicrafts in european or us high streets do not change the large , much bleaker picture of indian poverty .

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university villagers in the indian state of gujarat provide food for thought on one of the biggest economic issues of the century , as economist kaushik basu finds .
after driving from gujarat 's commercial capital , ahmedabad , for four hours , the highway meanders into a narrower , bumpier road and the landscape is flat and parched .
this is the edge of the salt deserts of kutch in gujarat .
the vegetation consists of the ubiquitous babul , a shrub-like plant that spreads all the way to the horizon .
the babul , i am told , is not natural to this region .
it was planted by some government officials to stop the spread of the desert , and has been fighting a losing battle ever since .
desolate village for the inhabitants of the region , survival depends on a life of perennial foraging for water and firewood .
but there is another activity for those who have the skill .
that is embroidery , especially mirror work , stitched into fabric .
to take a one sided view on globalisation seems wrong is globalisation a force for good ?
your views i am going to jakotra , where i will stay at the house of one such craftsperson , dohiben .
jakotra is a poor , desolate village , in the middle of nowhere .
by the time we arrive there it is night .
at dawn a winter mist hangs low over the dusty village roads and cows and goats stir languorously .
the womenfolk are out in their ornate , embroidered clothes , bare feet , and sets of three progressively smaller pots on their heads , in search of water .
over the next two days , in jakotra and manipur , outside ahmedabad , i talk to a number of village artisans about their precarious lives .
they are producing enormously labour-intensive handicrafts and barely making ends meet .
my thoughts turn inevitably to globalisation and its effect on such poor people .
it is a subject that one week later would be roundly castigated at the world social forum in bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong .
the reason why artisans like dohiben are better off today than 10 years ago -lrb- and they readily admit this -rrb- is because of the merits of globalisation .
if they had to sell their products only in the neighbouring villages , the demand would be tiny and prices abysmally low .
this is true at a more macro level as well .
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of india 's globalisation .
villagers ' fears research by tirthankar roy and maureen liebl shows that the export of handicrafts has surged since the reforms of 1991 , with its share in india 's manufacturing exports rising from two percent to 5 % during the last decade .
the rural poor need to be protected against unemployment .
the number of people employed in the handicrafts exports sector grew from just under four and a half million to nearly 10 million over the same period .
at the same time sitting in jakotra i could not dismiss the palpable anxiety of the villagers that they will eventually be out-competed by mechanized , large-scale manufacturers from far and wide .
the indian government used to guard against this risk by declaring that certain products must only be produced in the small-scale sector .
such policies may have been fine earlier but is folly in today 's global village , since other nations can go for cheap , large-scale production of those goods and export them to india .
so although globalisation has so far served the handicrafts sector well , there is no denial that some of these products will come under attack and india will not be able to ward that off .
action plan unless one is a market fundamentalist , one is forced to confront the question : what should the government do ?
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of globalisation .
first , it will have to spread education so that workers are able to shift from one sector to another as demand shifts .
second , it will have to provide a system of social security to protect the poor against new competition and adjustment unemployment .
instead of opposing globalisation or leaving it all to the market , pressure should be put on government for those kinds of limited interventions which provide shelter for the groups at risk .
such a policy is pragmatic .
globalisation and technological progress are the outcome of individual actions of millions of people .
it is doubtful if there is any government , organisation or corporation that can stall it , certainly not the governments of south asia .
this being so , it is better to channel india 's energy to counter its possible negative fall-out .
to pit oneself against a phenomenon where one has no chance against it is to court failure .
as oscar wilde said on his deathbed in a drab hotel room : " this wallpaper is terrible .
either it goes or i do . "
to read kaushik basu 's future columns , bookmark bbcnews.com / southasia here is a selection of comments about this article .
the situation has improved greatly since india began liberalising in 1991- poverty rates are falling , the economy is growing well and gdp per capita is on the rise too .
however , too much of the benefits remain for the upper middle and corporate classes of india .
the poor , the most downtrodden still remain bereft of most of the benefits globalisation can bring .
india 's prosperity should be judged not on how many people are below $ 1 / day , but how many people have two meals , a job and a home .
aruni , india refreshing to read an indian expert balances concern for social welfare with a keen understanding of the benefits and challenges of globalisation .
i wish the many so called ' intellectuals ' in india who have made careers and fortunes out of castigating globalisation had the wit to understand mr basu 's comments instead of indulging in the usual meaningless rethoric whilst playing into the hands of trade protectionists and anti-capitalists .
h s trivedi , uk globalisation is the best phenomenon south asia experienced ever since discovering zero .
no doubt about that .
there are too many success stories .
if not for globalisation how could sri lanka ever survive from a 20-year-long war that had virtually ruined its economy ?
if not for globalisation how could india became the high church of it in the whole world instead of being confined to its self-imposed wheel chair ?
if not for globalisation , how can we talk so high about the bangladesh and nepal becoming key business players in the region ?
let us not mince words .
it ¿ s a fact .
the only way south asia could make its mark in the world map is by providing the products and services it produces to the international market , by taking the best use of the environment created by the forces of globalisation .
chanuka wattegama , sri lanka the views put forward by kaushik basu apply especially to low-income nations whose integration into global product markets can be either beneficial or disastrous .
most of the workforce are employed in the production of low-wage and labour intensive goods and must compete with other countries for markets in developed countries .
although employment and production levels in such sectors may rise , eventually the phenomenon called ' immiserizing growth ' is a real possibility unless they are able to maintain their competitiveness through upgrading -lrb- mainly by moving up the value chain -rrb- .
furthermore , the rise of new trade rules on labour and the environment poses a danger as the rise of new forms of non-trade barriers and ' credence goods ' characteristics attest .
the reality jeopardizes the chance for low income producers who depend on such goods for their daily survival .
eventually , developing nations must improve the quality of their workforce and move up the value chain quickly or find new areas of ' comparative advantage ' that must be translated into ' competititve advantage ' .
shyamal k shrestha , nepal it seems like a preposterous argument that the best way to develop is to isolate our selves from the world .
globalisation like the market forces are a matter of fact that we must deal with , just like communists where completely off the track when they ignored the marketfoces , just as completeley off the track are nationalists when it comes to globalisation .
but beware of the european left , they are false friends that fight to keep their jobs in europe and from the asians .
they could not care less about our welfare .
sanjay , sweden change is implicit with globalization = and like change in any situation , some -lrb- if not most -rrb- of it is good and some bad .
fighting change - which is what the anti-globalization movement is about- can only result in stagnation .
that is hardly an optimal outcome .
vijay dandapani , usa i agree .
the government specially needs to prepare the nation for the downturn which is speedy at times and the workforce has to be flexible rather as part of their psyche .
protectionism , either by the state or the labor force has to be reigned in .
but there will be a human cost .
only preparedness will soften the blow .
somesguha , usa i am pained to read this article , not by the pitiable condition of the artisans living in india , but by the pathetic solutions offered by the learned economist .
these are the ideas of 20 or maybe 30 years ago of a socialist indian mindset .
where is the creativity of the new age ?
i thought , we produced better economists than that , or maybe you picked one from the wrong bunch .
how can you solve every problem by completely putting the responsibility on the government .
for how long can the government sustain every poor group in our country of more than a billion people .
combined with the latest technologies with their talents , indian industry can beat anybody in the world .
apoorva mathur , india i think there is some misconception about what anti-globalisation campaigners are saying .
although some are very hard-core the vast majority are not really against globalisation per se , but what company owners are doing -lrb- shutting down plants in the western countries and moving them elsewhere , leaving millions unemployed only to sell them back what they used to make themselves ; opening factories in poorer countries , exploiting child labour and paying ridiculously low wages .
that 's something they would n't dare do in the west -rrb- , against the imf and world bank -lrb- who impose draconian measures against countries who ask them for funds to finance their economic recovery -rrb- .
i do n't think any anti-globalisation campaigners are against handicrafts .
if you argue so you have a very twisted view of reality .
so please apply to yourself what you wrote : " to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong . "
norberto amaral , portugal india , like all developing countries has to tread the path to globalisation very carefully .
the pressure is on to open up the markets - and to what end ?
the wto wants developing nations to open up the agriculture sector so that the west can send in billions of dollars worth of highly subsidised food .
does this make sense ?
no .
the local farmers will starve and the affected countries become dependent on the rich farmers .
why do n't the rich countries get rid of the subsidies .
the wto should have a formula which looks at the income per capita increase for the poor countries .
set a target and a time-frame to achieve those targets .
then the whole world will know if globalisation is working. anil joshi , uk i am from the same part of gujrat -lrb- kutch -rrb- that you referred to in your article .
i am proud of the achievement of people from this region despite all obstacles .
you have touched an issue that is at heart of globalization .
your proposal of pragmatic solution is the right way for a country like india .
most people would agree that india can gain large benefit from globalization if correct policies and better execution is put in place .
i think the best way to achieve significant results are by creating an environment which fosters growth .
the main obstacle in india is still its centralized planning model .
when india will decentralize its development effort to local level , it will achieve its fullest potential .
this can be achieve by puting in simple policy of allowing local government to decide , collect and utilize taxes as appropriate to their local requirement .
this will create competition among local communities and india would be on greater development path .
bottom line , give power to local communites and then relax and watch the growth .
shailesh gala , usa i completely agree with prof basu .
globalisation is a force here to stay and in a way i believe india is best positioned to take advantage of this phenomenon .
in the short term it might negatively affect the underprevileged but in the long term it has the potential of integrating merit to markets in the most productive manner .
so we have to ensure that , while going from the short term to the long term , we do n't leave behind people not armed to resist the negative onslught of globablisation .
looking forward to more enlightening articles from prof basu. thanks kunal munjal , ny , usa generally globalisation is good for india and the region but it needs to be supported by good governmence.beside this people need to be educated on how globalisation works and how they can benefit from it .
i think the era of self suffiency and socialist policies are over in india and now the government should focus on how they can use globalisation to improve the life quality of massess .
suresh johnpillai , sri lanka / norway good article , but how about telling the same to us and uk .
why do all western economists and countries tell us to open up ... for the first time india has a little advantage on outsourcing and look at the reaction of the west ! ! ! ! !
such hypocrisy .
ajit khanna , india globalisation is the driving force behind the paradigm shift that is taking place right now .
no one is going to be able to resist this change , and it will bring the true global village encompassing the regions nationalistic , economic , religious and political movements .
thiru k , nj , usa the unfettered spread of free markets and technology to the developing world will provide higher standards of living as it has done in every country that has embraced a globalized economy .
david voigt , sacramento , california very insightful !
i 've always been an avid reader of dr. kaushik basu 's writing .
hasan faruq , bangladesh i believe mr basu is right .
globalization is inevitable and it has benefitted various sectors of the indian economy by providing employment for many who are a part of the export industry .
however , i do not agree with those who believe that globalization and free markets are the answer to world poverty and that opening up of markets has made the lives of the poor better .
yes , they are better off and some of the wealth has trickled down , but the important question is , how much ?
if they make a couple of dollars more each day because they produce for the global market , is that justified in comparison to the billions of dollars that mncs and industries make in the form of profits ?
i do n't think so .
if the government really believes in improving the lives of the rural poor , they need to step in and offer security and better standards and prices .
and , mncs who believe that they are providing better alternatives for the poor by offering low-wage jobs need to do more than that-again , by offering better wages , working conditions and health standards for their workers .
ultimately , i think , everyone profits from socially- and environmentally-just policies .
mridula swamy , india it is very well for someone like kaushik basu to make his ivory tower judgements about indian village life , but the kind of " limited intervention " he would like to see by the government has been the first casuality of globalization .
spending on health and education have never been lower in india , and welfare in the form of unemployment benefits has never existed .
this is one of the key issues taken up by critics of globalization , and a few success stories like the sale of indian handicrafts in european or us high streets do not change the large , much bleaker picture of indian poverty .

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university villagers in the indian state of gujarat provide food for thought on one of the biggest economic issues of the century , as economist kaushik basu finds .
after driving from gujarat 's commercial capital , ahmedabad , for four hours , the highway meanders into a narrower , bumpier road and the landscape is flat and parched .
this is the edge of the salt deserts of kutch in gujarat .
the vegetation consists of the ubiquitous babul , a shrub-like plant that spreads all the way to the horizon .
the babul , i am told , is not natural to this region .
it was planted by some government officials to stop the spread of the desert , and has been fighting a losing battle ever since .
desolate village for the inhabitants of the region , survival depends on a life of perennial foraging for water and firewood .
but there is another activity for those who have the skill .
that is embroidery , especially mirror work , stitched into fabric .
to take a one sided view on globalisation seems wrong is globalisation a force for good ?
your views i am going to jakotra , where i will stay at the house of one such craftsperson , dohiben .
jakotra is a poor , desolate village , in the middle of nowhere .
by the time we arrive there it is night .
at dawn a winter mist hangs low over the dusty village roads and cows and goats stir languorously .
the womenfolk are out in their ornate , embroidered clothes , bare feet , and sets of three progressively smaller pots on their heads , in search of water .
over the next two days , in jakotra and manipur , outside ahmedabad , i talk to a number of village artisans about their precarious lives .
they are producing enormously labour-intensive handicrafts and barely making ends meet .
my thoughts turn inevitably to globalisation and its effect on such poor people .
it is a subject that one week later would be roundly castigated at the world social forum in bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong .
the reason why artisans like dohiben are better off today than 10 years ago -lrb- and they readily admit this -rrb- is because of the merits of globalisation .
if they had to sell their products only in the neighbouring villages , the demand would be tiny and prices abysmally low .
this is true at a more macro level as well .
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of india 's globalisation .
villagers ' fears research by tirthankar roy and maureen liebl shows that the export of handicrafts has surged since the reforms of 1991 , with its share in india 's manufacturing exports rising from two percent to 5 % during the last decade .
the rural poor need to be protected against unemployment .
the number of people employed in the handicrafts exports sector grew from just under four and a half million to nearly 10 million over the same period .
at the same time sitting in jakotra i could not dismiss the palpable anxiety of the villagers that they will eventually be out-competed by mechanized , large-scale manufacturers from far and wide .
the indian government used to guard against this risk by declaring that certain products must only be produced in the small-scale sector .
such policies may have been fine earlier but is folly in today 's global village , since other nations can go for cheap , large-scale production of those goods and export them to india .
so although globalisation has so far served the handicrafts sector well , there is no denial that some of these products will come under attack and india will not be able to ward that off .
action plan unless one is a market fundamentalist , one is forced to confront the question : what should the government do ?
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of globalisation .
first , it will have to spread education so that workers are able to shift from one sector to another as demand shifts .
second , it will have to provide a system of social security to protect the poor against new competition and adjustment unemployment .
instead of opposing globalisation or leaving it all to the market , pressure should be put on government for those kinds of limited interventions which provide shelter for the groups at risk .
such a policy is pragmatic .
globalisation and technological progress are the outcome of individual actions of millions of people .
it is doubtful if there is any government , organisation or corporation that can stall it , certainly not the governments of south asia .
this being so , it is better to channel india 's energy to counter its possible negative fall-out .
to pit oneself against a phenomenon where one has no chance against it is to court failure .
as oscar wilde said on his deathbed in a drab hotel room : " this wallpaper is terrible .
either it goes or i do . "
to read kaushik basu 's future columns , bookmark bbcnews.com / southasia here is a selection of comments about this article .
the situation has improved greatly since india began liberalising in 1991- poverty rates are falling , the economy is growing well and gdp per capita is on the rise too .
however , too much of the benefits remain for the upper middle and corporate classes of india .
the poor , the most downtrodden still remain bereft of most of the benefits globalisation can bring .
india 's prosperity should be judged not on how many people are below $ 1 / day , but how many people have two meals , a job and a home .
aruni , india refreshing to read an indian expert balances concern for social welfare with a keen understanding of the benefits and challenges of globalisation .
i wish the many so called ' intellectuals ' in india who have made careers and fortunes out of castigating globalisation had the wit to understand mr basu 's comments instead of indulging in the usual meaningless rethoric whilst playing into the hands of trade protectionists and anti-capitalists .
h s trivedi , uk globalisation is the best phenomenon south asia experienced ever since discovering zero .
no doubt about that .
there are too many success stories .
if not for globalisation how could sri lanka ever survive from a 20-year-long war that had virtually ruined its economy ?
if not for globalisation how could india became the high church of it in the whole world instead of being confined to its self-imposed wheel chair ?
if not for globalisation , how can we talk so high about the bangladesh and nepal becoming key business players in the region ?
let us not mince words .
it ¿ s a fact .
the only way south asia could make its mark in the world map is by providing the products and services it produces to the international market , by taking the best use of the environment created by the forces of globalisation .
chanuka wattegama , sri lanka the views put forward by kaushik basu apply especially to low-income nations whose integration into global product markets can be either beneficial or disastrous .
most of the workforce are employed in the production of low-wage and labour intensive goods and must compete with other countries for markets in developed countries .
although employment and production levels in such sectors may rise , eventually the phenomenon called ' immiserizing growth ' is a real possibility unless they are able to maintain their competitiveness through upgrading -lrb- mainly by moving up the value chain -rrb- .
furthermore , the rise of new trade rules on labour and the environment poses a danger as the rise of new forms of non-trade barriers and ' credence goods ' characteristics attest .
the reality jeopardizes the chance for low income producers who depend on such goods for their daily survival .
eventually , developing nations must improve the quality of their workforce and move up the value chain quickly or find new areas of ' comparative advantage ' that must be translated into ' competititve advantage ' .
shyamal k shrestha , nepal it seems like a preposterous argument that the best way to develop is to isolate our selves from the world .
globalisation like the market forces are a matter of fact that we must deal with , just like communists where completely off the track when they ignored the marketfoces , just as completeley off the track are nationalists when it comes to globalisation .
but beware of the european left , they are false friends that fight to keep their jobs in europe and from the asians .
they could not care less about our welfare .
sanjay , sweden change is implicit with globalization = and like change in any situation , some -lrb- if not most -rrb- of it is good and some bad .
fighting change - which is what the anti-globalization movement is about- can only result in stagnation .
that is hardly an optimal outcome .
vijay dandapani , usa i agree .
the government specially needs to prepare the nation for the downturn which is speedy at times and the workforce has to be flexible rather as part of their psyche .
protectionism , either by the state or the labor force has to be reigned in .
but there will be a human cost .
only preparedness will soften the blow .
somesguha , usa i am pained to read this article , not by the pitiable condition of the artisans living in india , but by the pathetic solutions offered by the learned economist .
these are the ideas of 20 or maybe 30 years ago of a socialist indian mindset .
where is the creativity of the new age ?
i thought , we produced better economists than that , or maybe you picked one from the wrong bunch .
how can you solve every problem by completely putting the responsibility on the government .
for how long can the government sustain every poor group in our country of more than a billion people .
combined with the latest technologies with their talents , indian industry can beat anybody in the world .
apoorva mathur , india i think there is some misconception about what anti-globalisation campaigners are saying .
although some are very hard-core the vast majority are not really against globalisation per se , but what company owners are doing -lrb- shutting down plants in the western countries and moving them elsewhere , leaving millions unemployed only to sell them back what they used to make themselves ; opening factories in poorer countries , exploiting child labour and paying ridiculously low wages .
that 's something they would n't dare do in the west -rrb- , against the imf and world bank -lrb- who impose draconian measures against countries who ask them for funds to finance their economic recovery -rrb- .
i do n't think any anti-globalisation campaigners are against handicrafts .
if you argue so you have a very twisted view of reality .
so please apply to yourself what you wrote : " to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong . "
norberto amaral , portugal india , like all developing countries has to tread the path to globalisation very carefully .
the pressure is on to open up the markets - and to what end ?
the wto wants developing nations to open up the agriculture sector so that the west can send in billions of dollars worth of highly subsidised food .
does this make sense ?
no .
the local farmers will starve and the affected countries become dependent on the rich farmers .
why do n't the rich countries get rid of the subsidies .
the wto should have a formula which looks at the income per capita increase for the poor countries .
set a target and a time-frame to achieve those targets .
then the whole world will know if globalisation is working. anil joshi , uk i am from the same part of gujrat -lrb- kutch -rrb- that you referred to in your article .
i am proud of the achievement of people from this region despite all obstacles .
you have touched an issue that is at heart of globalization .
your proposal of pragmatic solution is the right way for a country like india .
most people would agree that india can gain large benefit from globalization if correct policies and better execution is put in place .
i think the best way to achieve significant results are by creating an environment which fosters growth .
the main obstacle in india is still its centralized planning model .
when india will decentralize its development effort to local level , it will achieve its fullest potential .
this can be achieve by puting in simple policy of allowing local government to decide , collect and utilize taxes as appropriate to their local requirement .
this will create competition among local communities and india would be on greater development path .
bottom line , give power to local communites and then relax and watch the growth .
shailesh gala , usa i completely agree with prof basu .
globalisation is a force here to stay and in a way i believe india is best positioned to take advantage of this phenomenon .
in the short term it might negatively affect the underprevileged but in the long term it has the potential of integrating merit to markets in the most productive manner .
so we have to ensure that , while going from the short term to the long term , we do n't leave behind people not armed to resist the negative onslught of globablisation .
looking forward to more enlightening articles from prof basu. thanks kunal munjal , ny , usa generally globalisation is good for india and the region but it needs to be supported by good governmence.beside this people need to be educated on how globalisation works and how they can benefit from it .
i think the era of self suffiency and socialist policies are over in india and now the government should focus on how they can use globalisation to improve the life quality of massess .
suresh johnpillai , sri lanka / norway good article , but how about telling the same to us and uk .
why do all western economists and countries tell us to open up ... for the first time india has a little advantage on outsourcing and look at the reaction of the west ! ! ! ! !
such hypocrisy .
ajit khanna , india globalisation is the driving force behind the paradigm shift that is taking place right now .
no one is going to be able to resist this change , and it will bring the true global village encompassing the regions nationalistic , economic , religious and political movements .
thiru k , nj , usa the unfettered spread of free markets and technology to the developing world will provide higher standards of living as it has done in every country that has embraced a globalized economy .
david voigt , sacramento , california very insightful !
i 've always been an avid reader of dr. kaushik basu 's writing .
hasan faruq , bangladesh i believe mr basu is right .
globalization is inevitable and it has benefitted various sectors of the indian economy by providing employment for many who are a part of the export industry .
however , i do not agree with those who believe that globalization and free markets are the answer to world poverty and that opening up of markets has made the lives of the poor better .
yes , they are better off and some of the wealth has trickled down , but the important question is , how much ?
if they make a couple of dollars more each day because they produce for the global market , is that justified in comparison to the billions of dollars that mncs and industries make in the form of profits ?
i do n't think so .
if the government really believes in improving the lives of the rural poor , they need to step in and offer security and better standards and prices .
and , mncs who believe that they are providing better alternatives for the poor by offering low-wage jobs need to do more than that-again , by offering better wages , working conditions and health standards for their workers .
ultimately , i think , everyone profits from socially- and environmentally-just policies .
mridula swamy , india it is very well for someone like kaushik basu to make his ivory tower judgements about indian village life , but the kind of " limited intervention " he would like to see by the government has been the first casuality of globalization .
spending on health and education have never been lower in india , and welfare in the form of unemployment benefits has never existed .
this is one of the key issues taken up by critics of globalization , and a few success stories like the sale of indian handicrafts in european or us high streets do not change the large , much bleaker picture of indian poverty .

globalization is inevitable and it has benefitted various sectors of the indian economy by providing employment for many who are a part of the export industry .

yes , they are better off and some of the wealth has trickled down , but the important question is , how much ?
if they make a couple of dollars more each day because they produce for the global market , is that justified in comparison to the billions of dollars that mncs and industries make in the form of profits ?
i do n't think so .
if the government really believes in improving the lives of the rural poor , they need to step in and offer security and better standards and prices .
and , mncs who believe that they are providing better alternatives for the poor by offering low-wage jobs need to do more than that-again , by offering better wages , working conditions and health standards for their workers .
ultimately , i think , everyone profits from socially- and environmentally-just policies .

this is one of the key issues taken up by critics of globalization , and a few success stories like the sale of indian handicrafts in european or us high streets do not change the large , much bleaker picture of indian poverty .

by kaushik basu professor of economics , cornell university villagers in the indian state of gujarat provide food for thought on one of the biggest economic issues of the century , as economist kaushik basu finds .
after driving from gujarat 's commercial capital , ahmedabad , for four hours , the highway meanders into a narrower , bumpier road and the landscape is flat and parched .
this is the edge of the salt deserts of kutch in gujarat .
the vegetation consists of the ubiquitous babul , a shrub-like plant that spreads all the way to the horizon .
the babul , i am told , is not natural to this region .
it was planted by some government officials to stop the spread of the desert , and has been fighting a losing battle ever since .
desolate village for the inhabitants of the region , survival depends on a life of perennial foraging for water and firewood .
but there is another activity for those who have the skill .
that is embroidery , especially mirror work , stitched into fabric .
to take a one sided view on globalisation seems wrong is globalisation a force for good ?
your views i am going to jakotra , where i will stay at the house of one such craftsperson , dohiben .
jakotra is a poor , desolate village , in the middle of nowhere .
by the time we arrive there it is night .
at dawn a winter mist hangs low over the dusty village roads and cows and goats stir languorously .
the womenfolk are out in their ornate , embroidered clothes , bare feet , and sets of three progressively smaller pots on their heads , in search of water .
over the next two days , in jakotra and manipur , outside ahmedabad , i talk to a number of village artisans about their precarious lives .
they are producing enormously labour-intensive handicrafts and barely making ends meet .
my thoughts turn inevitably to globalisation and its effect on such poor people .
it is a subject that one week later would be roundly castigated at the world social forum in bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong .
the reason why artisans like dohiben are better off today than 10 years ago -lrb- and they readily admit this -rrb- is because of the merits of globalisation .
if they had to sell their products only in the neighbouring villages , the demand would be tiny and prices abysmally low .
this is true at a more macro level as well .
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of india 's globalisation .
villagers ' fears research by tirthankar roy and maureen liebl shows that the export of handicrafts has surged since the reforms of 1991 , with its share in india 's manufacturing exports rising from two percent to 5 % during the last decade .
the rural poor need to be protected against unemployment .
the number of people employed in the handicrafts exports sector grew from just under four and a half million to nearly 10 million over the same period .
at the same time sitting in jakotra i could not dismiss the palpable anxiety of the villagers that they will eventually be out-competed by mechanized , large-scale manufacturers from far and wide .
the indian government used to guard against this risk by declaring that certain products must only be produced in the small-scale sector .
such policies may have been fine earlier but is folly in today 's global village , since other nations can go for cheap , large-scale production of those goods and export them to india .
so although globalisation has so far served the handicrafts sector well , there is no denial that some of these products will come under attack and india will not be able to ward that off .
action plan unless one is a market fundamentalist , one is forced to confront the question : what should the government do ?
the handicrafts sector has been a major beneficiary of globalisation .
first , it will have to spread education so that workers are able to shift from one sector to another as demand shifts .
second , it will have to provide a system of social security to protect the poor against new competition and adjustment unemployment .
instead of opposing globalisation or leaving it all to the market , pressure should be put on government for those kinds of limited interventions which provide shelter for the groups at risk .
such a policy is pragmatic .
globalisation and technological progress are the outcome of individual actions of millions of people .
it is doubtful if there is any government , organisation or corporation that can stall it , certainly not the governments of south asia .
this being so , it is better to channel india 's energy to counter its possible negative fall-out .
to pit oneself against a phenomenon where one has no chance against it is to court failure .
as oscar wilde said on his deathbed in a drab hotel room : " this wallpaper is terrible .
either it goes or i do . "
to read kaushik basu 's future columns , bookmark bbcnews.com / southasia here is a selection of comments about this article .
the situation has improved greatly since india began liberalising in 1991- poverty rates are falling , the economy is growing well and gdp per capita is on the rise too .
however , too much of the benefits remain for the upper middle and corporate classes of india .
the poor , the most downtrodden still remain bereft of most of the benefits globalisation can bring .
india 's prosperity should be judged not on how many people are below $ 1 / day , but how many people have two meals , a job and a home .
aruni , india refreshing to read an indian expert balances concern for social welfare with a keen understanding of the benefits and challenges of globalisation .
i wish the many so called ' intellectuals ' in india who have made careers and fortunes out of castigating globalisation had the wit to understand mr basu 's comments instead of indulging in the usual meaningless rethoric whilst playing into the hands of trade protectionists and anti-capitalists .
h s trivedi , uk globalisation is the best phenomenon south asia experienced ever since discovering zero .
no doubt about that .
there are too many success stories .
if not for globalisation how could sri lanka ever survive from a 20-year-long war that had virtually ruined its economy ?
if not for globalisation how could india became the high church of it in the whole world instead of being confined to its self-imposed wheel chair ?
if not for globalisation , how can we talk so high about the bangladesh and nepal becoming key business players in the region ?
let us not mince words .
it ¿ s a fact .
the only way south asia could make its mark in the world map is by providing the products and services it produces to the international market , by taking the best use of the environment created by the forces of globalisation .
chanuka wattegama , sri lanka the views put forward by kaushik basu apply especially to low-income nations whose integration into global product markets can be either beneficial or disastrous .
most of the workforce are employed in the production of low-wage and labour intensive goods and must compete with other countries for markets in developed countries .
although employment and production levels in such sectors may rise , eventually the phenomenon called ' immiserizing growth ' is a real possibility unless they are able to maintain their competitiveness through upgrading -lrb- mainly by moving up the value chain -rrb- .
furthermore , the rise of new trade rules on labour and the environment poses a danger as the rise of new forms of non-trade barriers and ' credence goods ' characteristics attest .
the reality jeopardizes the chance for low income producers who depend on such goods for their daily survival .
eventually , developing nations must improve the quality of their workforce and move up the value chain quickly or find new areas of ' comparative advantage ' that must be translated into ' competititve advantage ' .
shyamal k shrestha , nepal it seems like a preposterous argument that the best way to develop is to isolate our selves from the world .
globalisation like the market forces are a matter of fact that we must deal with , just like communists where completely off the track when they ignored the marketfoces , just as completeley off the track are nationalists when it comes to globalisation .
but beware of the european left , they are false friends that fight to keep their jobs in europe and from the asians .
they could not care less about our welfare .
sanjay , sweden change is implicit with globalization = and like change in any situation , some -lrb- if not most -rrb- of it is good and some bad .
fighting change - which is what the anti-globalization movement is about- can only result in stagnation .
that is hardly an optimal outcome .
vijay dandapani , usa i agree .
the government specially needs to prepare the nation for the downturn which is speedy at times and the workforce has to be flexible rather as part of their psyche .
protectionism , either by the state or the labor force has to be reigned in .
but there will be a human cost .
only preparedness will soften the blow .
somesguha , usa i am pained to read this article , not by the pitiable condition of the artisans living in india , but by the pathetic solutions offered by the learned economist .
these are the ideas of 20 or maybe 30 years ago of a socialist indian mindset .
where is the creativity of the new age ?
i thought , we produced better economists than that , or maybe you picked one from the wrong bunch .
how can you solve every problem by completely putting the responsibility on the government .
for how long can the government sustain every poor group in our country of more than a billion people .
combined with the latest technologies with their talents , indian industry can beat anybody in the world .
apoorva mathur , india i think there is some misconception about what anti-globalisation campaigners are saying .
although some are very hard-core the vast majority are not really against globalisation per se , but what company owners are doing -lrb- shutting down plants in the western countries and moving them elsewhere , leaving millions unemployed only to sell them back what they used to make themselves ; opening factories in poorer countries , exploiting child labour and paying ridiculously low wages .
that 's something they would n't dare do in the west -rrb- , against the imf and world bank -lrb- who impose draconian measures against countries who ask them for funds to finance their economic recovery -rrb- .
i do n't think any anti-globalisation campaigners are against handicrafts .
if you argue so you have a very twisted view of reality .
so please apply to yourself what you wrote : " to take a one-sided view on globalisation seems wrong . "
norberto amaral , portugal india , like all developing countries has to tread the path to globalisation very carefully .
the pressure is on to open up the markets - and to what end ?
the wto wants developing nations to open up the agriculture sector so that the west can send in billions of dollars worth of highly subsidised food .
does this make sense ?
no .
the local farmers will starve and the affected countries become dependent on the rich farmers .
why do n't the rich countries get rid of the subsidies .
the wto should have a formula which looks at the income per capita increase for the poor countries .
set a target and a time-frame to achieve those targets .
then the whole world will know if globalisation is working. anil joshi , uk i am from the same part of gujrat -lrb- kutch -rrb- that you referred to in your article .
i am proud of the achievement of people from this region despite all obstacles .
you have touched an issue that is at heart of globalization .
your proposal of pragmatic solution is the right way for a country like india .
most people would agree that india can gain large benefit from globalization if correct policies and better execution is put in place .
i think the best way to achieve significant results are by creating an environment which fosters growth .
the main obstacle in india is still its centralized planning model .
when india will decentralize its development effort to local level , it will achieve its fullest potential .
this can be achieve by puting in simple policy of allowing local government to decide , collect and utilize taxes as appropriate to their local requirement .
this will create competition among local communities and india would be on greater development path .
bottom line , give power to local communites and then relax and watch the growth .
shailesh gala , usa i completely agree with prof basu .
globalisation is a force here to stay and in a way i believe india is best positioned to take advantage of this phenomenon .
in the short term it might negatively affect the underprevileged but in the long term it has the potential of integrating merit to markets in the most productive manner .
so we have to ensure that , while going from the short term to the long term , we do n't leave behind people not armed to resist the negative onslught of globablisation .
looking forward to more enlightening articles from prof basu. thanks kunal munjal , ny , usa generally globalisation is good for india and the region but it needs to be supported by good governmence.beside this people need to be educated on how globalisation works and how they can benefit from it .
i think the era of self suffiency and socialist policies are over in india and now the government should focus on how they can use globalisation to improve the life quality of massess .
suresh johnpillai , sri lanka / norway good article , but how about telling the same to us and uk .
why do all western economists and countries tell us to open up ... for the first time india has a little advantage on outsourcing and look at the reaction of the west ! ! ! ! !
such hypocrisy .
ajit khanna , india globalisation is the driving force behind the paradigm shift that is taking place right now .
no one is going to be able to resist this change , and it will bring the true global village encompassing the regions nationalistic , economic , religious and political movements .
thiru k , nj , usa the unfettered spread of free markets and technology to the developing world will provide higher standards of living as it has done in every country that has embraced a globalized economy .

results of research showed the company what most web users knew already - that they do not like them .
the ads will not be allowed on msn 's uk , nordic and belgian sites , with the ban extending to other countries soon .
msn , which has about 350 million global visitors to its sites , is the latest to ban pop-up ads after aol started to block them from its us sites last year .
popping off msn started to block pop-ups on its us sites at the end of 2003 .
" -lsb- we have -rsb- taken the decision to no longer sell pop-up and pop-under ads .
local countries will make the change at the best time to suit their local market needs and to meet pre existing arrangements with msn customers , " a spokesperson said .
" removing pop-ups and pop-unders on msn is a win for consumers , advertisers and our partners . "
microsoft has recently been working with online ad developers , unicast , to come up with a new kind of adverts for the web .
they have been trialling 30 second-long tv-style ads that appear at random when users click on certain websites .
the new video ads are being tested on 15 sites over the next five weeks , including msn , abcnews , pepsi and honda .
chasing the ' x ' there are browsers and free tools on the net which give web users the ability to block pop-up adverts already .
yahoo and google both started to offer pop-up blockers in early 2003 .
some versions of internet explorer also have the ability to restrict sites and block ones with pop-ups , but this has to be set by the user manually .
pop-up adverts have evolved since the early days of the net , as websites try to attract more users , and online business becomes more commercially successful .
advertisers have tried to come up with different ways to entice users into clicking on their adverts .
many have users chasing them around their screens in order to close them , and some are designed to make it difficult for users to click on the " x " to shut them down .
apart from interrupting web users ' surfing , they have been largely unpopular with many who have found they often contain adult content , unsuitable for younger web surfers .

dr susan johnson was involved with the women 's health initiative study that was halted early in the us amid breast cancer and stroke fears .
however , she told a conference in seattle that the benefits made the small risks worthwhile in many cases .
she said that she had persuaded some of her patients to start on hrt again .
hrt - hormone replacement therapy - is taken by millions of women worldwide to relieve menopausal symptoms .
however , there has been concern for some time that long-term users might increase their risk of breast cancer , heart attack and stroke .
massive studies were set up in the us and europe in an attempt to gauge with more precision the level of risk each woman might face .
halted early the women 's health initiative trial in the us was halted early in 2002 when , at that stage , results suggested that women taking a particular type of hrt faced a 26 % increased risk of breast cancer , a 29 % bigger risk of heart attack , and 41 % higher risk of stroke than a " control " group taking a dummy placebo pill . "
a lot of these women have abandoned hormone treatment , i think prematurely " dr susan johnson , whi study this was offset by reductions in the risk of certain other cancers , such as colon , and a fall in the risk of hip fracture .
and although the statistics seemed alarming , it actually translated to just a 0.1 % higher risk of breast cancer for each year a woman takes hrt .
hrt is thought to have been responsible for 20,000 extra cases of breast cancer in the uk over 10 years - and it has been used by tens of millions of women during that period .
while the us study group was composed of women with no menopausal problems - meaning they did not experience the principal benefit of the treatment - experts say women with these symptoms should definitely be considering hrt .
' still safe ' dr johnson told the american association for the advancement of science conference in seattle : " one of the groups that has abandoned it are the women who have hot flushes - for whom hrt is still a safe and effective therapy .
" a lot of these women have abandoned hormone treatment , i think prematurely .

halted early the women 's health initiative trial in the us was halted early in 2002 when , at that stage , results suggested that women taking a particular type of hrt faced a 26 % increased risk of breast cancer , a 29 % bigger risk of heart attack , and 41 % higher risk of stroke than a " control " group taking a dummy placebo pill .
a lot of these women have abandoned hormone treatment , i think prematurely dr susan johnson , whi study this was offset by reductions in the risk of certain other cancers , such as colon , and a fall in the risk of hip fracture .
and although the statistics seemed alarming , it actually translated to just a 0.1 % higher risk of breast cancer for each year a woman takes hrt .
hrt is thought to have been responsible for 20,000 extra cases of breast cancer in the uk over 10 years - and it has been used by tens of millions of women during that period .
while the us study group was composed of women with no menopausal problems - meaning they did not experience the principal benefit of the treatment - experts say women with these symptoms should definitely be considering hrt .
' still safe ' dr johnson told the american association for the advancement of science conference in seattle : " one of the groups that has abandoned it are the women who have hot flushes - for whom hrt is still a safe and effective therapy .
" a lot of these women have abandoned hormone treatment , i think prematurely .
" it is very difficult to talk a lot of these women into reconsidering hormone therapy - i spend a lot of time doing it . "
in the uk , guidelines from the royal college of physicians of edinburgh suggest that hrt remains an appropriate treatment for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes .
professor david purdie , an expert on hrt and osteoporosis from edinburgh , resigned from a government advisory group last year when the uk committee on safety of medicines advised that the treatment should not be used in future to help prevent brittle bone disease .
he said that the risks accompanying the treatment had been " magnified " , and that hrt remained a useful treatment .
he said : " i think this will cause great confusion again and uneccessary worry through the country .
" i can sympathise with women who do n't know where to turn now . "
