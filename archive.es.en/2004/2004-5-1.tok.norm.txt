germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .

unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "

schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .

in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .

wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .

some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .

prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .
alongside the party at wenceslas square , a group of avowed " euro skeptics " have promised to hold a mock funeral to bury czech sovereignty . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 .

on the edge of germany , at the center of europe in the decade since the fall of the iron curtain , an unusual piece of real estate at the edge of germany has become the backdrop for an economic success story on the fringe of the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.05.2004 german unions call for a free , equal and just europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nothing is good this way " - unions oppose the government 's reform plans .
as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .

" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .

in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .

wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .

heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .

prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .
alongside the party at wenceslas square , a group of avowed " euro skeptics " have promised to hold a mock funeral to bury czech sovereignty . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2004 germany embraces its eastern neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany opens its arms to poland : foreign ministers fischer -lrb- right -rrb- and cimoszewicz .
in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 .
the new europe read dw-world 's special report on enlargement .
on the edge of germany , at the center of europe in the decade since the fall of the iron curtain , an unusual piece of real estate at the edge of germany has become the backdrop for an economic success story on the fringe of the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2004 schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder called enlargement a " historic mission " in his speech to parliament .
trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .
in cyprus , two days of celebrations kicked off , including fireworks , dancing and bands playing traditional music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague viewed from prague castle further north in prague , the party started in wenceslas square , where scores of people gathered at the site of the pro-democracy demonstrations that triggered the country 's velvet revolution and ended communist rule there in 1989 .
wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant portrait of hungarian modell anita korsos wearing an eu jersey of a water polo player hangs from the columns of the elizabeth bridge in budapest .
on friday in budapest , a 15-foot yellow water polo ball was rolled onto the central elizabeth bridge along with huge posters of hungary 's water polo players - and models dressed up like them -lrb- photo -rrb- - to show off the country 's sporting achievements .
at midnight , prime minister peter medgyessy turned over a 25-foot hourglass .
in lithuania , leaders asked citizens to light candles at midnight , to show that their country is the brightest of all the new members .
a u.s. satellite was in position to take pictures of the glowing country from space .
a series of festivities called the " day of welcomes " was scheduled for ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dublin night sky was lit up by what has been billed the " world 's largest online artwork . "
heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses guests during the an eu enlargement party to celebrate the entry of 10 new countries into the european union , at the foreign and commonwealth office in london .
prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .
alongside the party at wenceslas square , a group of avowed " euro skeptics " have promised to hold a mock funeral to bury czech sovereignty . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2004 germany embraces its eastern neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany opens its arms to poland : foreign ministers fischer -lrb- right -rrb- and cimoszewicz .
in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.05.2004 german unions call for a free , equal and just europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nothing is good this way " - unions oppose the government 's reform plans .
as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .
union organizers , however , said schröder was not even invited this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ?

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .

they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .

unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .
union organizers , however , said schröder was not even invited this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ?

in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .

most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .

heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .

even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .

you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .

the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .

russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2004 schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder called enlargement a " historic mission " in his speech to parliament .
trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .
providing , of course , they have a visa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia clinches deal with eu over kaliningrad the eu and russia acheived a breakthrough over the russian enclave of kaliningrad , but president putin stuck to his guns in the matter of the troubled region of chechnya .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2004 opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion will bring new challenges for germany 's beleaguered unions .
may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .

they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .

" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2004 german minister says iraq could destabilize middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the americans have inherited the entire array of conflicts , fischer said .
germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .

he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .

he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?

he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2004 opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion will bring new challenges for germany 's beleaguered unions .
may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .
in cyprus , two days of celebrations kicked off , including fireworks , dancing and bands playing traditional music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague viewed from prague castle further north in prague , the party started in wenceslas square , where scores of people gathered at the site of the pro-democracy demonstrations that triggered the country 's velvet revolution and ended communist rule there in 1989 .
wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant portrait of hungarian modell anita korsos wearing an eu jersey of a water polo player hangs from the columns of the elizabeth bridge in budapest .
on friday in budapest , a 15-foot yellow water polo ball was rolled onto the central elizabeth bridge along with huge posters of hungary 's water polo players - and models dressed up like them -lrb- photo -rrb- - to show off the country 's sporting achievements .
at midnight , prime minister peter medgyessy turned over a 25-foot hourglass .
in lithuania , leaders asked citizens to light candles at midnight , to show that their country is the brightest of all the new members .
a u.s. satellite was in position to take pictures of the glowing country from space .
a series of festivities called the " day of welcomes " was scheduled for ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dublin night sky was lit up by what has been billed the " world 's largest online artwork . "
heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks and laser shows lit up the sky over europe as here in breslau , poland .
when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .
in cyprus , two days of celebrations kicked off , including fireworks , dancing and bands playing traditional music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague viewed from prague castle further north in prague , the party started in wenceslas square , where scores of people gathered at the site of the pro-democracy demonstrations that triggered the country 's velvet revolution and ended communist rule there in 1989 .
wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant portrait of hungarian modell anita korsos wearing an eu jersey of a water polo player hangs from the columns of the elizabeth bridge in budapest .
on friday in budapest , a 15-foot yellow water polo ball was rolled onto the central elizabeth bridge along with huge posters of hungary 's water polo players - and models dressed up like them -lrb- photo -rrb- - to show off the country 's sporting achievements .
at midnight , prime minister peter medgyessy turned over a 25-foot hourglass .
in lithuania , leaders asked citizens to light candles at midnight , to show that their country is the brightest of all the new members .
a u.s. satellite was in position to take pictures of the glowing country from space .
a series of festivities called the " day of welcomes " was scheduled for ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dublin night sky was lit up by what has been billed the " world 's largest online artwork . "
heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses guests during the an eu enlargement party to celebrate the entry of 10 new countries into the european union , at the foreign and commonwealth office in london .
prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .
alongside the party at wenceslas square , a group of avowed " euro skeptics " have promised to hold a mock funeral to bury czech sovereignty . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes .

until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .
in cyprus , two days of celebrations kicked off , including fireworks , dancing and bands playing traditional music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague viewed from prague castle further north in prague , the party started in wenceslas square , where scores of people gathered at the site of the pro-democracy demonstrations that triggered the country 's velvet revolution and ended communist rule there in 1989 .
wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant portrait of hungarian modell anita korsos wearing an eu jersey of a water polo player hangs from the columns of the elizabeth bridge in budapest .
on friday in budapest , a 15-foot yellow water polo ball was rolled onto the central elizabeth bridge along with huge posters of hungary 's water polo players - and models dressed up like them -lrb- photo -rrb- - to show off the country 's sporting achievements .
at midnight , prime minister peter medgyessy turned over a 25-foot hourglass .
in lithuania , leaders asked citizens to light candles at midnight , to show that their country is the brightest of all the new members .
a u.s. satellite was in position to take pictures of the glowing country from space .
a series of festivities called the " day of welcomes " was scheduled for ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dublin night sky was lit up by what has been billed the " world 's largest online artwork . "
heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses guests during the an eu enlargement party to celebrate the entry of 10 new countries into the european union , at the foreign and commonwealth office in london .
prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .
alongside the party at wenceslas square , a group of avowed " euro skeptics " have promised to hold a mock funeral to bury czech sovereignty . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day !

on the edge of germany , at the center of europe in the decade since the fall of the iron curtain , an unusual piece of real estate at the edge of germany has become the backdrop for an economic success story on the fringe of the european union .

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .

"
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .

a spokesman for the city said that 111 people were briefly held and some 60 police officers were lightly injured in the scuffles .
in what has become an annual ritual with no obvious political links , berlin youths broke up a pacifist may day assembly in mauerpark in the city 's eastern part and began hurling beer bottles and other projectiles at police who attempted to restrain them .
further protests are expected later saturday in berlin 's multi-ethnic kreuzberg district , where the clashes with police are usually heaviest .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .

fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.05.2004 german unions call for a free , equal and just europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nothing is good this way " - unions oppose the government 's reform plans .
as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .
union organizers , however , said schröder was not even invited this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ?

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .

referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .

they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .
providing , of course , they have a visa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia clinches deal with eu over kaliningrad the eu and russia acheived a breakthrough over the russian enclave of kaliningrad , but president putin stuck to his guns in the matter of the troubled region of chechnya .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .
from ireland to lithuania , celebrations marked a europe united across the east-west divide . in budapest , three bridges across the danube river were closed off for partying .
in berlin , the area around the brandenburg gate was cordoned off for a two-day street festival and the tiny nation of malta launched the biggest fireworks display of all the new eu members .
at the stroke of midnight on friday , and nearly six years after entry negotiations started , the eu 's starry blue flags were hoisted over ten new nations .
most are former warsaw pact members : the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
the other two newcomers to the european club , the island nations of malta and cyprus , were never under soviet influence .
" five decades after our great project of european integration began , the divisions of the cold war are gone - once and for all , " european commission chief romano prodi told reporters .
" good day , europe , " was the headline in pravda , a daily newspaper in slovakia .
the country 's lawmakers convened a special session of parliament where its chairman , pavol hrusovsky , reminded the nation of its progress since throwing off the yoke of communism in 1989 .
pop open the champagne other nations were more in the mood for a raucous party .
in cyprus , two days of celebrations kicked off , including fireworks , dancing and bands playing traditional music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague viewed from prague castle further north in prague , the party started in wenceslas square , where scores of people gathered at the site of the pro-democracy demonstrations that triggered the country 's velvet revolution and ended communist rule there in 1989 .
wojtek luranc , a 25-year old from poland , had come to prague for the weekend with his wife " to celebrate the day in the capital city of our neighbor , " he told the afp press agency .
" it 's a great day , " he said .
" we have waited for this moment for 60 years . "
he and the other party-goers enjoyed a fireworks show at midnight and on saturday the country 's prime minister , vladimir spidla , meets his german and polish counterparts for ceremonies at zittau , the german town located where the borders of germany , poland and the czech republic meet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant portrait of hungarian modell anita korsos wearing an eu jersey of a water polo player hangs from the columns of the elizabeth bridge in budapest .
on friday in budapest , a 15-foot yellow water polo ball was rolled onto the central elizabeth bridge along with huge posters of hungary 's water polo players - and models dressed up like them -lrb- photo -rrb- - to show off the country 's sporting achievements .
at midnight , prime minister peter medgyessy turned over a 25-foot hourglass .
in lithuania , leaders asked citizens to light candles at midnight , to show that their country is the brightest of all the new members .
a u.s. satellite was in position to take pictures of the glowing country from space .
a series of festivities called the " day of welcomes " was scheduled for ireland , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dublin night sky was lit up by what has been billed the " world 's largest online artwork . "
heads of state from the 25 eu countries were invited to the festivities and the irish police staged a huge security operation , since officials feared anti-globalization protestors could try to crash the party .
some 2,500 soldiers were put on stand-by and all police leave was cancelled .
underlying concern but underlying all the merry-making are real worries among some in both new and old eu countries that this big bang could do more harm than good .
it is perhaps telling that most of the old eu member states have little planned to mark the expansion .
to counter widespread fears that the western economies will suffer as jobs move over to low-wage new accession states , german chancellor gerhard schröder made a nationally broadcast speech in which he sought to allay concerns .
greater trade across an enlarged europe " will make us not poorer , but richer , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses guests during the an eu enlargement party to celebrate the entry of 10 new countries into the european union , at the foreign and commonwealth office in london .
prime minister tony blair of britain , a country with an often wary attitude toward the bloc , commented in the times of london that the expansion was " a catalyst for change within the eu . "
even in the new member states , whose populations are generally more enthusiastic about expansion than those in the current eu-15 , there is some lingering ambivalence .
some people fear steep rises in the prices of consumer goods or being swallowed up in a faceless eu and ruled over by " eurocrats " in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2004 eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people crossing the river memel from kaliningrad into lithuania will be entering the eu from may 1 .
the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2004 schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder called enlargement a " historic mission " in his speech to parliament .
trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2004 schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder called enlargement a " historic mission " in his speech to parliament .
trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .
" it has nothing to do with naked populism , it 's about responsibility to europe , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.05.2004 german unions call for a free , equal and just europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " nothing is good this way " - unions oppose the government 's reform plans .
as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .

may 1 is the traditional day of revelry for unions in germany and europe .
but with eu eastward expansion and the growing pains of globalization , do they have anything to celebrate this year ? in many countries , may 1 is the day when the international labor movement celebrates its gains in the areas of political rights and social security .
for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

for more than a century , unions have fought for better living standards and improved working conditions .
these goals have been largely reached in germany , but they are under increasing pressure through the onslaught of globalization .
the number of unemployed in germany is high , and the upcoming enlargement of the european union has created concerns for both german workers and businesses .
the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- is now calling on people to demonstrate on may 1 under the motto : " our europe : free , equal and just . "
for the unions , may 1 is interesting for two reasons .
significantly , 10 new countries will be joining the european union on this day .
it is a community that sees itself as responsible for maintaining social goals .
together with workers in the new eu member states , unions want to create a europe of freedom , equality and tolerance .
this community should offer all people the same opportunity to lead a life of self-determination , but not at the expense of people in other parts of the world .
it 's a noble goal - especially considering that in the run-up to the accession date , dark clouds are already starting to form on the horizon of the unified europe .
the unions and social democrats complain that more and more german companies are exporting jobs to places like the czech republic , hungary and slovakia .
employer associations have chalked the changes up to the need to stay competitive , but the unions have their own parlance for it : " wage dumping . "
the relationship between the social democrats and unions in germany is already strained .
for the first time , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not been invited to the may demonstrations this year .
and at the beginning of the year , leading union bosses like ver.di chief frank bsirske marched in the front rows of numerous demonstrations against social cuts made by the government coalition of the social democrats and the green party .
in addition to steadily declining membership , the unions are also bothered by something they did n't realize in the past : support for them is lacking in the spd .
the historical common destiny of the social democratic party and the unions has cracked if not broken altogether .
europe is now coalescing and will be even bigger in the future , with the intended entry of countries like rumania , bulgaria and croatia .
it will become an economic colossus with the will and might to compete against strong and ambitious regions like the united states and asia .
now unions are making demands for minimum wages and minimum social standards that do n't stop at borders .
that 's why international concerns are getting ready , for cost reasons , to move even further into the east .
following that logic , a place like hungary is already too expensive in terms of wages .
the caravan , it seems , is heading even further east to ukraine or belarus .
technology giant siemens recently created a stir with the announcement that it wants to export a considerable number of the jobs it currently has in germany to the new eu member states .
the consequence of these corporate policies is a race to take advantage of the lower taxes and social standards in the accession countries .
the perception is that high levels of employment go hand in hand with low wages and limited employee rights as well as low corporate taxes .
eastward enlargement could lead to a situation where social welfare systems in the old members of the european union would be put under further pressure .
with all of these developments , there are two questions one must ask : in the race to become economically competitive and innovative on an international scale , did n't the unions lose their influence long ago ?
and will their demands for just pay for everyone in europe turn out to be nothing more than a fading hope ? klaus feldkeller -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .

"
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .

economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations . on may 1 , when ten new countries join the european union , the borders of the bloc will shift to the east and south and they will be under close scrutiny .
one of the conditions laid down by the powers in brussels was the strict control of the eu 's new external borders . for lithuania , this has proved to be particularly difficult , as the residents of kaliningrad - the russian enclave caught between poland and lithuania that was once part of germany - used the baltic country as a transit route to mainland russia .
until the summer of 2003 , this was possible without special documents .
but then a transit agreement was put in place that provides for so-called " facilitated transit documents " - euphemistic language for what is basically a visa . those traveling between moscow and kaliningrad can take train number 149 .
the 1,330 kilometer journey takes approximately 22 hours . the train itself hasn ’ t lost much of its soviet-era charm : its kept its tacky curtains , the windows that can ’ t be opened despite unbearable heat within the carriage , and the staff who keep the train clean with nothing but elbow grease and corn brooms .
the culinary choices on board also hearken back to soviet days : dry , tasteless cookies and tea drunk from the samovar - still heated by coal .
the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

the ambience is pure pre-perestroika russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the passengers travelling the route are business people , like zoja and nadja from kaliningrad who travel once or twice a month to moscow . for more than eight months now , zoja and nadja have been travelling with the so-called frtd - the facilitated rail transit document .
it ’ s made things a bit more complicated . passengers face nerve wracking vetting " you just have to come and buy the ticket at the train station 28 hours before departure , " muses zoja and the train chugs on .
" and then you ’ re told whether you can get on the train or not .
it ’ s a bit nerve racking because you have to be very attentive , spell your name correctly .
otherwise you ’ ll have problems on the lithuanian border . " in the next wagon sits sergeij , a doctor from kaliningrad coming back from moscow where he attended a training course .
he says he understands the need for controls and special documents . " the only inconvenience is when you have to leave urgently .
you always have to buy the ticket 28 hours in advance because the lithuanians need time to issue the transit documents .
the lithuanian consular agent then comes on the train .
he ’ s very polite and gives you the documents . " no documents ?
no train ride . mindaugas paulukas is one of these consular agents .
he has a list of all passengers on the train and hands out the frtd travel documents during the trip .
on average , there is about one passenger on every train who hasn ’ t qualified for the frtd and ends up being " detrained , " as the russians call it . " the main problem is that people don ’ t have valid passports , " paulukas said .
" most frequently it ’ s the soldiers from the russian military who don ’ t seem to understand the need for transit documents and they are sometimes aggressive .
but most people cry or offer money . " " the reactions of the people are not really surprising - you would have the same reaction if you had to get off the train - especially if you ’ re coming from the very far regions of russia , such as siberia for example .
it ’ s not always easy but these reactions are actually quite human , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city walls in kaliningrad .
after an hour and a half of controls at the lithuanian-russian border , and another 150 kilometers , the train finally reaches kaliningrad .
the trip is long and exhausting and yet the transit agreement seems to suit all sides involved . eu neighbors could leave kaliningrad behind more worrying in the long term is that kaliningrad might fall far behind its baltic neighbors once they join the european union .
at the beginning of 2003 , the average wage in the kaliningrad region was about € 125 a month - roughly half of that in lithuania and a third of the average wage in poland .
there are other problems too .
corruption and criminality in the enclave are rampant .
hiv / aids rates are said to be ten times higher than in neighboring lithuania . increasing cooperation with kaliningrad is thus a clear priority for the lithuanian foreign minister antanas valionis .
" we would like to avoid some kind of black spot inside the european union .
if you have very poor people there , very low social and economic level - you will have big tensions on the border , " valionis told dw-world . a developed region benefits everyone " even different prices for cigarettes and fuel for example would create problems for lithuania .
so we would like to have a well developed region more or less at the same level as poland and lithuania .
only in this case , can we co-operate , can we be open for trade , open for cultural exchange and people to people contacts and so on . " the european union can ’ t afford to have a black spot within its borders .
russia , for its part , should be worried about kaliningrad falling far behind its neighbors .
the downward spiral could prompt people in the enclave to loosen ties with the russian economy and seek closer links with those of the eu countries .
viktor tschernyschov who writes for the monthly german-speaking newspaper königsberger express fears the enclave is not really a priority for moscow . " moscow has much more important problems at the moment .
after all we ’ re just one of over 80 regions in the russian federation - and , on top of that , the smallest . " the people from kaliningrad travel 14 times more than their fellow russians from the mainland .
surrounded by the enlarged eu , they might be tempted to take the road to europe and go to vilnius , warsaw or even berlin – all cities far closer than their capital moscow .

trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . in a speech before parliament , schröder said the eu 's enlargement was a " historic mission " that would ensure peace and security for europe .
" finally the painful separation of europe which has lasted for decades will be overcome , " he said . he offered the new eu members - the majority of which are formerly communist countries from eastern europe - a hearty welcome back into the " european family . "
but schröder also addressed the fears many germans have about enlargement , saying he understood many people were worried about losing their jobs to lower wage competition in the new countries . " the federal government takes seriously the concern that enlargement has increased pressure on the labor market , " he said , justifying the employment restrictions germany has implemented for new eu citizens . he also admitted globalization might cause some german companies to move jobs abroad , but added that such shifts could help strength their core business at home .
" that can also lead to more employment in our own country , " schröder said .
" together we have to make clear that the opportunities outweigh the risks . " schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax worries both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the leader of the conservative opposition , also hailed the eu 's expansion , but said that the government had not prepared germany for the event .
she said berlin needed to learn from other eu members which had already implemented successful economic reforms . " we have to occupy ourselves with our weakness , " she said , noting germany 's poor growth and high unemployment .
" if we do n't , we wo n't be successful in europe . " schröder also addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the draft eu constitution , saying he would push for negotiations to be wrapped up before the end of the irish eu presidency in june .
negotiations over the charter collapsed in december when spain and poland rejected a proposed new voting system they felt would limit their power . he said he was pleased the new spanish government had changed its opposition to the constitution 's proposed changes in voting rights and acceptance of deciding eu matters on with the so-called " double majority " principle .
" i hope that poland is now prepared to do so as well , " he said . row over turkey schröder also attacked the conservative opposition for using " naked populism " in opposing the eu bid of turkey .
he said it would " enormously increase security " for europe if the muslim country became a part of the bloc .
eu leaders are scheduled to decide by december whether to approve turkey 's candidacy bid , which would clear the way for membership negotiations over the next several years . " if the commission this autumn recommends taking up accession talks because turkey has satisfied the political criteria , then i will emphatically support this course , " schröder said .
his comments come one day after french president jacques chirac said he did not support turkey 's bid to join the european union in the near future . merkel on friday said accepting turkey would overwhelm the eu 's ability to integrate the country into europe .

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2004 germany embraces its eastern neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany opens its arms to poland : foreign ministers fischer -lrb- right -rrb- and cimoszewicz .
in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .
no longer cold war opponents , on may 1 the three countries symbolize the bridging of the east-west divide which had characterized europe for so much of its recent history .
fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .
the dawn of a new europe czech prime minister vladimir spidla and polish prime minister leszek miller , who had traveled to zittau for saturday 's border opening ceremony , said the accession was proof that past antagonisms had been overcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , second right , poland 's prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner günter verheugen eat bread and salt , a traditional greeting , given by girls dressed in traditional clothes , during the eu enlargement ceremony in zittau , germany " the old europe was one of xenophobia and war , " spidla added , describing the new europe as one of " peace and unity . "
" in 1989 the iron curtain fell , then came german reunification and today the eu is enlarging , " the czech leader said .
" it think that 's not a bad performance for 15 years . "
miller said " our great polish dream came true today " and joined his colleagues in paying tribute to the peaceful revolutions in eastern europe that buried communism and paved the road to a united europe .
linking up europe the three leaders then took up shovels for a symbolic first dig in zittau of a road that will link the three countries and allow for the free travel of people and goods in the region .
" we have reached a point where borders do not matter anymore , " said eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen , who was also in zittau for the historic ceremony .
further north , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his polish counterpart wlodwiermierz cimoszewicz met on the bridge linking frankfurt-an-der-oder and slubice .
the two embraced in a demonstration marking the end of decades-old animosities .
economic barriers still remain but not all barriers have fallen .
with the euro still not the official currency in the new member states for some years to come and the free movement of labor put on hold for up to seven years , europe is not entirely united .
it still makes a difference where a person comes from , and more importantly where a person works .
in the newcomer nations , celebrations were often dampened by fears of a loss of national identity and steep price increases as the smaller nations are swallowed in the large bloc .
in the 15 older member states , worries of an influx of immigrants and loss of jobs to cheap labor further east prevented many people from seeing only the positive sides of enlargement .
the head of the german trade union association , michael sommer , warned politicians across europe to pay closer attention to the concerns of their citizens .
speaking at the unions ' labor day rally in berlin , he challenged politicians to go beyond the pro-enlargement rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand protesters .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day !

germany 's joschka fischer , a chief opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , said on saturday he feared continued fighting in iraq was destabilizing the entire middle east and playing into the hands of islamic terrorism . in some of his strongest criticism of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq to date , fischer was quoted in the german news magazine der spiegel as saying the situation in iraq had reached a critical stage , and that the current turmoil threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a wider eruption of violence in the middle east .
" the very thing that i feared has happened , " the foreign minister said .
" we feared the occupation -lsb- of iraq -rsb- would strengthen islamic terrorism and destabilize the region - and that 's what 's looming now . "
fischer , like chancellor gerhard schröder , had been a strong opponent of the war from the very beginning .
but after german-american relations suffered a serious blow last year over support for the invasion , the two leaders softened their rhetoric and refrained from direct criticism of the u.s. invasion .
since then both politicians have concentrated on securing a bigger role for the united nations .
had washington turned over authority to the united nations at a much earlier date , as many in europe had requested , fischer is convinced the current situation could have been avoided or at least could have been better contained .
" when the americans marched into baghdad , they became the decisive middle-eastern power , " he told the magazine .
" they inherited the entire array of conflicts .
that was the primary reason we warned against the war - and not because there was an election campaign -lsb- in germany -rsb- going on , as some have claimed . "
at the time many political observers in berlin and washington had accused fischer , who ran for the greens party , and schröder of the spd , of capitalizing on the anti-war stance in order to rake in more votes from the largely pacifist population .
u.n. must take over in iraq fischer said there was a very real danger that the problems in iraq could spread to more violence in the region .
he urged the united states to hand over complete control of the political process to the u.n.
" i fear it 's becoming increasingly difficult to find positive ways of resolving matters , " he worried .
" it 's possible that two hot conflicts become linked - that is , the israel-palestine conflict and iraq . "
" a very explosive mixture has been created in the region and i think the europeans would do well to do what they can to bring a moderating influence to the situation , " he said referring to the eu 's attempts to take on a bigger diplomatic role .
speaking on behalf of the german government , fischer once again stressed that germany would not send troops to iraq , not even in the framework of a nato mission .
" i do n't see how european troops , from either france or germany , could make any constructive contribution , " he said .
the iraqis " would also view us as an occupying force , we should n't have any illusions about that . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .

as the eu celebrates its enlargement , trade unionists and members of leftists groups rallied in germany to mark the labor day holiday , criticizing the government and drawing attention to the plight of workers in europe . while fireworks went off and politicians popped the corks on champagne bottles at celebrations honoring europe 's historic enlargement , thousands of people gathered at protest marches and rallies throughout germany on may day , the traditional workers ' holiday .
the main rally took place in berlin where the dgb trade union association voiced its criticism of the german government 's labor reform plans against the backdrop of the eu expansion which was ushered in on the same day .
gathered under the banner " our europe - free , equal and just , " union members and leaders attacked chancellor gerhard schöder 's widely unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package as being " neither social nor just . "
the set of reform proposals which covers , among others , changes to the national healthcare system , a revamping of unemployment subsidies and a streamlining of the social welfare benefits program , were introduced by schröder and the coalition of social democrats and greens in order to kickstart the sputtering german economy .
" for two-thirds of germans , agenda 2010 has become a synonym for a society with plenty of poor and a few rich , " proclaimed dgb chief michael sommer , in reference to the many germans who have to dig deep into their pockets after their social benefits are cut .
he listed the lower work salaries , increased work hours and " labor conditions from the 19th century " as reasons to oppose the current government 's reform proposals .
referring to the eu 's enlargement , sommer challenged politicians to go beyond the rhetoric of the past few months .
" i can only warn our politicians to take the concerns of our people and those in the accession countries more seriously .
they 're worried about their jobs and social benefits , " he told a crowd of several thousand in front of berlin 's city hall .
" let me spell this out very clearly : we 're not content with just a couple of well-phrased assertions concerning the enlarged bloc 's bright future and merry-making across the eu on this day ! "
unions face off against government the unionists , traditional allies of schröder 's social democratic party , see themselves increasingly alienated from the government .
they oppose the set of social and labor reforms which slash long-term unemployment subsidies and introduce new hiring laws to make it easier for employers to lay off staff .
they accuse schröder and his economic advisors of putting the needs of big business before those of the workers .
the head of the builders ' union , klaus wiesenhügel , accused the government of practicing the wrong politics , because " everyone 's going to lose except for the very few wealthy people . "
but the opposition conservatives do n't present much of an alternative , he said : " they want to turn our society into a paradise for the rich and a labor camp for the rest of us . "
at a big rally in the western city of mannheim , the head of the country 's largest industrial union , ig metall , told a crowd of about 3,000 people that other better reforms are possible .
" we want to apply pressure with a widespread citizen 's initiative , " union chief jürgen peters said , announcing the start of a nationwide petition against schröder 's plans .
schröder , who in the past has always attended the may day rallies , was not included in this year 's events .
according to his spokesperson , the chancellor was too busy with eu enlargement activities to participate in the union 's demonstrations .
union organizers , however , said schröder was not even invited this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : do germany 's unions need to issue a mayday ?

in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news . the leaders of cold war foes germany , poland and the czech republic gathered in the german border town of zittau to hoist the european union flag on saturday .

fifteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , german chancellor gerhard schröder welcomed his neighbors into the enlarged eu .
" the division of our continent and with it the division of its citizens has finally been overcome , " he said .
" the people of central and eastern europe are part of a closely knit family again . "
addressing thousands from the tri-border region , schröder said a dream of many generations of europeans had finally become a reality .
although he acknowledged that some people still feared a europe without borders , he said there was no denying the political impact the joining of the eastern european nations would have on forging a joint social and foreign policy on the continent .
" dear citizens , above all for those of you who are older and lived through world war ii and everything that came after it , who would have thought 60 years ago that there would be a day like this , a day on which europe is united and we have a chance to make europe a place of lasting peace and prosperity , " he said .

carlos castano disappeared after a shootout at his ranch on 16 april and initial reports suggested he had gone into hiding from former comrades .
but a friend of castano has told reuters news agency the auc leader was actually captured , tortured and killed .
his likely death could damage talks between the paramilitaries and bogota .
castano had been convicted of innumerable massacres and murders and was one of colombia 's most feared men .
at the time of the attack , the auc -lrb- united self-defence forces of colombia -rrb- was in talks with the government to demobilise its 13,000 heavily armed fighters .
it seems that elements within the auc had feared castano was about to cut a deal with the us , where he is wanted on charges of smuggling 17 tonnes of cocaine .
the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott reports that the attack on his ranch appears to have been carried out by other right-wing paramilitaries linked to the drugs trade .
' extradition deal ' the unnamed source who spoke to reuters said he had spoken to witnesses who had seen what had happened at the ranch .
" they caught commander carlos alive that very day and they killed him two days later , after they kept him for two days with his hands and legs bound , in his underwear , " the source said .
responding to the reuters report , colombian president alvaro uribe said he was " respectful " of it but could not otherwise comment .
afp news agency quoted a rival paramilitary leader , commander rodrigo " double-aught " franco , as saying castano had been killed for refusing to rule out the us extradition of his men on drug charges , our correspondent reports that castano 's death , if confirmed , endangers current peace talks between the government and the auc which castano began in december 2002 .
castano founded the auc in 1997 although he had been fighting a war to the death with the country 's left-wing rebels ever since they kidnapped and killed his father over 20 years ago .

the sexual offences act tightens anti-child sex abuse measures and repeals bans on buggery between men .
home secretary david blunkett said the new act replaces laws which were " based on the victorian era " .
anyone convicted of contacting a child with the intention of committing a sex offence will face up to 10 years in jail under a new grooming offence .
these are dreadful crimes and the challenge for police remains john yates boy challenges young sex laws teenage kissing : new crime ?
mr blunkett said : " new laws offer increased protection , especially to children and vulnerable people , combat modern crimes such as grooming and , for the first time , do away with discrimination by applying the law equally to men and women . "
a rapist will have to be " honest and reasonable " in their belief they took reasonable steps to ensure their partner consented to sex .
this aims to ensure ministers increase the rape conviction rate , which stands at just 7 % .
significant step juries will be able to assume there was no consent if a rape victim was asleep , unconscious or disabled , or if there was violence or threats involved .
under the act , men who have previously been convicted of buggery and indecency between men with a consensual partner aged over 16 , will have their names removed from the sex offenders ' register .
association of chief police officers spokesman john yates said : " we have lobbied hard for many of the significant changes , particularly around the re-definition of the offence of rape and for the first time clear legal guidance around the definition of ' consent ' .
" these are dreadful crimes and the challenge for police remains .
" we need to ensure we continue to develop and enhance our response to these crimes at every level , including victim care , forensic recovery and training . "
nspcc policy adviser , christine atkinson , claimed the new act was " the most significant package of sex offence legislation in many years . "
she said : " for too long , child sex offenders have been able to walk away from their crimes with short and insufficient sentences .
" increasing prison terms to 14 years or in certain cases life , means that at last , sex abusers will feel the full force of the law when they are sentenced . "
measures in the new act include : closing a loophole which allowed men to claim sex with under-13s was consensual - any sexual intercourse with a child of that age will be dealt with as rape and carry a maximum sentence of life .
a range of new offences designed to tackle inappropriate sexual activity with children , including a new offence of causing a child to engage in sexual activity which will capture behaviour such as persuading children to undress .
updating incest offences to cover not just blood relatives but also foster and adoptive parents and live-in partners .
toughening requirements of the sex offenders ' register .
a new offence to protect the public from unacceptable sexual acts in public toilets .
bestiality and necrophilia become specific offences for the first time .
voyeurs will face prosecution if they spy on someone else for their sexual gratification .
a new offence of trafficking people for sexual exploitation - with a 14-year maximum term .
three new offences to protect people with learning disabilities or mental illnesses from abuse .

anyone convicted of contacting a child with the intention of committing a sex offence will face up to 10 years in jail under a new grooming offence .
these are dreadful crimes and the challenge for police remains john yates boy challenges young sex laws teenage kissing : new crime ?
mr blunkett said : " new laws offer increased protection , especially to children and vulnerable people , combat modern crimes such as grooming and , for the first time , do away with discrimination by applying the law equally to men and women . "
a rapist will have to be " honest and reasonable " in their belief they took reasonable steps to ensure their partner consented to sex .
this aims to ensure ministers increase the rape conviction rate , which stands at just 7 % .
significant step juries will be able to assume there was no consent if a rape victim was asleep , unconscious or disabled , or if there was violence or threats involved .
under the act , men who have previously been convicted of buggery and indecency between men with a consensual partner aged over 16 , will have their names removed from the sex offenders ' register .
association of chief police officers spokesman john yates said : " we have lobbied hard for many of the significant changes , particularly around the re-definition of the offence of rape and for the first time clear legal guidance around the definition of ' consent ' .
" these are dreadful crimes and the challenge for police remains .
" we need to ensure we continue to develop and enhance our response to these crimes at every level , including victim care , forensic recovery and training . "
nspcc policy adviser , christine atkinson , claimed the new act was " the most significant package of sex offence legislation in many years . "
she said : " for too long , child sex offenders have been able to walk away from their crimes with short and insufficient sentences .
" increasing prison terms to 14 years or in certain cases life , means that at last , sex abusers will feel the full force of the law when they are sentenced . "
measures in the new act include : closing a loophole which allowed men to claim sex with under-13s was consensual - any sexual intercourse with a child of that age will be dealt with as rape and carry a maximum sentence of life .
a range of new offences designed to tackle inappropriate sexual activity with children , including a new offence of causing a child to engage in sexual activity which will capture behaviour such as persuading children to undress .
updating incest offences to cover not just blood relatives but also foster and adoptive parents and live-in partners .
toughening requirements of the sex offenders ' register .
a new offence to protect the public from unacceptable sexual acts in public toilets .

scientists in the united states will test the jab on 480 people as part of a government-funded study .
the vaccine has been developed by vaxgen .
it is designed to last longer and have fewer side-effects than the existing vaccine .
however , these are early stage trials .
even if the jab proves effective it will be a number of years before it becomes available .
millions being spent the us government has given millions of dollars in recent years to companies trying to develop a new anthrax vaccine .
the current vaccine was developed in the 1950s and is really only used to vaccinate military personnel or people who have contact with animals that harbour anthrax .
the goal is to develop an anthrax vaccine with better protection dr geoffrey gorse , st louis university officials insist the vaccine is safe .
however , it is controversial .
some soldiers claim it is linked to gulf war syndrome .
the main problem with the existing vaccine is that a number of injections are required over a few months before it becomes fully effective .
booster shots are also needed every year .
the us anthrax mail attacks , which claimed the lives of five people in 2001 , have spurred many companies to try to develop more effective vaccines and new antidotes .
the us government has drawn up plans to stockpile millions of doses of anthrax vaccine .
anthrax particles or spores are highly infectious and can kill .
a study , published last year , suggested an anthrax bomb or missile in a city the size of new york could kill as many as 123,000 people even if every victim received treatment .
this latest vaccine will be tested on people in 12 cities across the us .
scientists hope it will provide protection much more quickly than the current vaccine .
" the goal is to develop an anthrax vaccine with better protection , an improved safety profile and a simpler dosing schedule , " said dr geoffrey gorse of st louis university , who is heading the trial .
the uk 's health protection agency manufactures another anthrax vaccine at its facilities in porton down .
a spokesman said it backed new research into possible alternatives .
" the current us jab requires six inoculations as part of the vaccination schedule , " he said .

badalamenti became notorious in the us for masterminding a crime ring which distributed heroin and cocaine through pizza parlours between 1975 and 1984 .
he was sentenced in 1987 to 47 years in federal prison .
italy also convicted badalamenti in absentia of the 1978 murder of a radio dj who poked fun at the mafia .
the remains of giuseppe " peppino " impastato were found torn apart by a bomb on a sicilian railway line .
badalamenti was finally convicted of the crime in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison .
reuters news agency quoted an unnamed prison official as saying he died of a heart attack at a us federal medical centre in devens , massachusetts , on thursday evening .
rival bosses born in the village of cinisi near palermo in 1923 , gaetano badalamenti became a key figure in the sicilian cosa nostra in the 1970s .
known as " don tano " , he was part of the so-called ' triumvirate ' that ran the sicilian mafia .
us prosecutors once labelled him the " boss of bosses " for his leading role .
however , the rise of a rival , salvatore " toto " riina , forced him to flee italy , and he spent some time in brazil .
in the us , he led a racket to import heroin from the middle east and cocaine from south america , laundering profits through swiss bank accounts .
the " pizza " ring was worth an estimated $ 1.65bn.
last october in italy , he and former prime minister giulio andreotti were acquitted of involvement in the murder of journalist mino pecorelli in 1979 .

however , the commission has suggested some radical boundary changes and , for the mps and assembly members whose careers depend on electoral geography , the devil is in the detail .
the sitting ulster unionist mp for east antrim , roy beggs , seems , for example , reasonably sanguine about the replacement of his constituency with a new seat to be called antrim coast and glens .
is this because the ulster unionist party are happy to swap loyalist cloughfern , which becomes part of north belfast , for the nationalist glens in the hope that tactical voting might help them turn back the dup tide ?
maybe so , but they should bear in mind that by the time these changes come into effect - presuming they are not overturned by local inquiries - we shall almost certainly have already had another westminster election at which sammy wilson will have renewed his challenge for the seat .
further south , the changes to south down give sinn fein cause for hope , as the loss of ballynahinch and the addition of half of newry would strengthen the nationalist identity of the seat .
despite that , the sdlp assembly member pj bradley also appears relaxed about the proposals .
the sdlp can at least take solace from the notion that they are likely to defend the existing seat within its existing boundaries next time around .
whether they will defend it with its existing mp , eddie mcgrady , remains to be seen .
given that - as tip o 'neill said - " all politics is local " , our elected representatives can be forgiven for studying their maps .
but if they get a chance to lift their eyes and glance at the latest report from the electoral commission they might wonder exactly how many voters will be bothering to go to the polls in any future contests .
the commission analysed the figures for last november 's assembly elections and found that 122,000 fewer people took part than in 1998 .
the commission says the fall in the numbers registered to vote masked the decline in turnout .
officially turnout was 64 % , extremely healthy by uk standards .
but the commission compared the number of people going to the polls to the population over 18 and reached a much lower figure of just 56 % .
vacuum the commission says 46 % of the people it surveyed for its report had little or no interest in local politics .
contrasting that with a similar survey carried out in 1998 which suggested only 32 % were similarly disinterested , the commission believes apathy and disengagement is a growing problem , especially among the young .
in this regard , northern ireland is catching up with the rest of the uk .
but why ?
some who took part in a commission focus group cited the lack of movement in the political process , others blamed the confrontational nature of politics .
the idea that a vacuum does not stimulate interest is probably self-evident .
but the notion that confrontation is to blame for falling turnout is a bit of a conundrum .
after all , was n't it the high stakes nature of politics during the troubles which gave northern ireland its inflated turnout figures , as voters went to the polls as much to ensure the other side did n't win as to back their own candidate ?
is it heresy to suggest that turnout might be falling because politics has started to work , albeit imperfectly ?
nevertheless , northern ireland politics may be in particular danger of alienating younger voters because of its transitional nature .
if the old unionist-nationalist battle is putting some off , it has yet to be replaced by the bread and butter politics of other societies .
elsewhere in the commission report , the thinktank democratic dialogue blames media commentators , myself included , for framing last year 's assembly election within traditional constitutional lines , concentrating on the bigger parties .
the fact is , though , that we are still stuck in a talks process dominated by concerns over paramilitarism and powersharing .
even if a devolved government had been formed last year the peculiar system at stormont would have made it hard for voters to ensure their chosen candidates ' policies on , say , the 11-plus or health care , were translated into action by the relevant government department .
tackling apathy may not only require the " voter education and public awareness strategies " suggested by the electoral commission , but also the development of a political system where the way someone votes makes a difference when it comes to bread and butter issues .

the sitting ulster unionist mp for east antrim , roy beggs , seems , for example , reasonably sanguine about the replacement of his constituency with a new seat to be called antrim coast and glens .
is this because the ulster unionist party are happy to swap loyalist cloughfern , which becomes part of north belfast , for the nationalist glens in the hope that tactical voting might help them turn back the dup tide ?
maybe so , but they should bear in mind that by the time these changes come into effect - presuming they are not overturned by local inquiries - we shall almost certainly have already had another westminster election at which sammy wilson will have renewed his challenge for the seat .
further south , the changes to south down give sinn fein cause for hope , as the loss of ballynahinch and the addition of half of newry would strengthen the nationalist identity of the seat .
despite that , the sdlp assembly member pj bradley also appears relaxed about the proposals .
the sdlp can at least take solace from the notion that they are likely to defend the existing seat within its existing boundaries next time around .
eddie mcgrady 's south down seat will not change before the next election whether they will defend it with its existing mp , eddie mcgrady , remains to be seen .
given that - as tip o 'neill said - " all politics is local " , our elected representatives can be forgiven for studying their maps .
but if they get a chance to lift their eyes and glance at the latest report from the electoral commission they might wonder exactly how many voters will be bothering to go to the polls in any future contests .
the commission analysed the figures for last november 's assembly elections and found that 122,000 fewer people took part than in 1998 .
the commission says the fall in the numbers registered to vote masked the decline in turnout .
officially turnout was 64 % , extremely healthy by uk standards .
but the commission compared the number of people going to the polls to the population over 18 and reached a much lower figure of just 56 % .
vacuum the commission says 46 % of the people it surveyed for its report had little or no interest in local politics .
contrasting that with a similar survey carried out in 1998 which suggested only 32 % were similarly disinterested , the commission believes apathy and disengagement is a growing problem , especially among the young .
in this regard , northern ireland is catching up with the rest of the uk .
but why ?
some who took part in a commission focus group cited the lack of movement in the political process , others blamed the confrontational nature of politics .
the idea that a vacuum does not stimulate interest is probably self-evident .
but the notion that confrontation is to blame for falling turnout is a bit of a conundrum .
after all , was n't it the high stakes nature of politics during the troubles which gave northern ireland its inflated turnout figures , as voters went to the polls as much to ensure the other side did n't win as to back their own candidate ?
the transitional nature of ni politics may be alienating younger voters is it heresy to suggest that turnout might be falling because politics has started to work , albeit imperfectly ?
nevertheless , northern ireland politics may be in particular danger of alienating younger voters because of its transitional nature .
if the old unionist-nationalist battle is putting some off , it has yet to be replaced by the bread and butter politics of other societies .
elsewhere in the commission report , the thinktank democratic dialogue blames media commentators , myself included , for framing last year 's assembly election within traditional constitutional lines , concentrating on the bigger parties .
the fact is , though , that we are still stuck in a talks process dominated by concerns over paramilitarism and powersharing .
even if a devolved government had been formed last year the peculiar system at stormont would have made it hard for voters to ensure their chosen candidates ' policies on , say , the 11-plus or health care , were translated into action by the relevant government department .
tackling apathy may not only require the " voter education and public awareness strategies " suggested by the electoral commission , but also the development of a political system where the way someone votes makes a difference when it comes to bread and butter issues .

" in many of these incidents drivers have claimed that they were not aware of the presence of the crossing patrols as there are several other highway workers who have yellow protective clothes , which creates confusion .
" in some cases this may just be an excuse for bad driving .
" but to avoid all doubt , we will be introducing the new uniforms which will clearly be identifiable as school crossing patrols when the new school terms start in september . "
