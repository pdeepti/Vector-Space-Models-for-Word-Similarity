program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.06.2004 portugal hopes for euro economic bonus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal invested over € 650 million in ten stadiums .
when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .
but it can put the people in a good mood and that can help the economy , " he said , adding that bonus could apply to whichever country is eventually crowned champion . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's carnival of soccer gets underway the euro 2004 soccer finals get underway in portugal on june 12 with sixteen nations ready to fight it out for the coveted henri delauney trophy and the honour of being crowned european champions 23 days later .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the view from the summit g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit from bit player to global heavyweight what is the g-8 ?
china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .
but it can put the people in a good mood and that can help the economy , " he said , adding that bonus could apply to whichever country is eventually crowned champion . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's carnival of soccer gets underway the euro 2004 soccer finals get underway in portugal on june 12 with sixteen nations ready to fight it out for the coveted henri delauney trophy and the honour of being crowned european champions 23 days later .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .

criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching . the g-8 is not officially recognized as an international organization because its summits are largely informal in nature .
during its annual meetings , the group of leading industrial nations focuses primarily on advising on issues affecting the global economy such as unemployment and trade or the social situation in developing countries .
recently , however , the group has begun shifting its attention away from the purely economic to the political arena , as world events such as the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states or the iraq war take center stage .
the u.s.-led invasion to topple saddam hussein had led to a rift among the members , who were divided over support for the war , but during last year 's summit in evian , the group concentrated on mending ties .
at the same time , talks focused on drafting a coordinated plan of action for the war on terror and the creation of an anti-terror group .
an exclusive club once a year , the heads of state and government of the eight member nations meet for the world economic summit .
the president of the european commission -lrb- the executive arm of the eu -rrb- is invited to attend , as are representatives from various other states .
the high-profile gatherings are often targeted by globalization critics , whose protests have turned increasingly violent in the past several years .
the group was established in 1975 as the g-6 by then-french president valérey giscard d 'estaing and former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
it included france , germany , italy , japan , great britain and the united states .
in 1976 the group expanded to include canada .
it remained the g-7 until 1998 , when russia was accepted as a full member .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .

schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching . the g-8 is not officially recognized as an international organization because its summits are largely informal in nature .
during its annual meetings , the group of leading industrial nations focuses primarily on advising on issues affecting the global economy such as unemployment and trade or the social situation in developing countries .
recently , however , the group has begun shifting its attention away from the purely economic to the political arena , as world events such as the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states or the iraq war take center stage .
the u.s.-led invasion to topple saddam hussein had led to a rift among the members , who were divided over support for the war , but during last year 's summit in evian , the group concentrated on mending ties .
at the same time , talks focused on drafting a coordinated plan of action for the war on terror and the creation of an anti-terror group .
an exclusive club once a year , the heads of state and government of the eight member nations meet for the world economic summit .
the president of the european commission -lrb- the executive arm of the eu -rrb- is invited to attend , as are representatives from various other states .
the high-profile gatherings are often targeted by globalization critics , whose protests have turned increasingly violent in the past several years .
the group was established in 1975 as the g-6 by then-french president valérey giscard d 'estaing and former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
it included france , germany , italy , japan , great britain and the united states .
in 1976 the group expanded to include canada .
it remained the g-7 until 1998 , when russia was accepted as a full member .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .

although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching . the g-8 is not officially recognized as an international organization because its summits are largely informal in nature .
during its annual meetings , the group of leading industrial nations focuses primarily on advising on issues affecting the global economy such as unemployment and trade or the social situation in developing countries .
recently , however , the group has begun shifting its attention away from the purely economic to the political arena , as world events such as the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states or the iraq war take center stage .
the u.s.-led invasion to topple saddam hussein had led to a rift among the members , who were divided over support for the war , but during last year 's summit in evian , the group concentrated on mending ties .
at the same time , talks focused on drafting a coordinated plan of action for the war on terror and the creation of an anti-terror group .
an exclusive club once a year , the heads of state and government of the eight member nations meet for the world economic summit .
the president of the european commission -lrb- the executive arm of the eu -rrb- is invited to attend , as are representatives from various other states .
the high-profile gatherings are often targeted by globalization critics , whose protests have turned increasingly violent in the past several years .
the group was established in 1975 as the g-6 by then-french president valérey giscard d 'estaing and former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
it included france , germany , italy , japan , great britain and the united states .
in 1976 the group expanded to include canada .
it remained the g-7 until 1998 , when russia was accepted as a full member .
spain is currently striving for membership . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

reverting back to the shaven headed look of 2001 , the england captain will not be the focus of these european championships when it comes to tresses .
gone are the extreme mohawks of the pre-world cup games of 2002 and the rooster cut of the tournament itself , becks will have to stand aside this time to let a new king of the coiffeur take center stage in portugal .
but who could carry such a weight ?
beckham was more than man enough to take on the mantle once held by ruud gullit 's rasta mop , the perennial perm of rudi völler and the rat tail of roberto baggio .
in fact , no other footballer has ever inspired so many copycat hair atrocities .
there were even reports that female fans in japan were styling their pubic hair in the style of the becks mohawk .
sadly , there seems to be very few stars at euro 2004 willing to let their hair down or inspire trends to such an extreme .
the majority of the northern european players look all very tidy but ever so boring with their trainee police officer short-back-and-sides haircuts .
even the wild man look of spain 's carles puyol and the glossy latin locks of the italian boys pale into insignificance compared to the " cornrows " sported by mr. posh on england 's south african tour last year .
maybe someone like veteran latvia defender mihails zemlinskis , with his eastern european " soccer shocker " mullet , could play prince regent until a worthy successor comes along .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .
but it can put the people in a good mood and that can help the economy , " he said , adding that bonus could apply to whichever country is eventually crowned champion . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's carnival of soccer gets underway the euro 2004 soccer finals get underway in portugal on june 12 with sixteen nations ready to fight it out for the coveted henri delauney trophy and the honour of being crowned european champions 23 days later .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the view from the summit g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit from bit player to global heavyweight what is the g-8 ?
china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .

an accomplice of scherdizki has also been sentenced to four years and three months in prison .
the judges said that the accused had siphoned the funds with the help of fictitious credit agreements and finally invested the amount in a german cement company via other companies .
the money was part of a payment made by the german to a ukrainian " funding pool for bilateral understanding and reconciliation . "
following the disappearance of the money , the ukrainian government had to step in order to compensate for the nazi-regime victims . more briefs 05.06.2004 -pipe- government wants to increase gay partners ' rights 05.06.2004 -pipe- schröder criticized over d-day plans 02.06.2004 -pipe- teens admit they terrorized student 02.06.2004 -pipe- bomb trial begins in dresden 01.06.2004 -pipe- kahn mulls leaving bayern munich 01.06.2004 -pipe- germany sends aid to sudan 01.06.2004 -pipe- five north koreans escape to german school 28.05.2004 -pipe- trial against chancellor-slapper delayed 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .

" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .
the demonstrations - at times violent - took place in the nearby swiss town of geneva , where numerous international organizations such as the u.n. and wto have headquarters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de evian braces for protests as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g-8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc still no decision on filters for diesel cars the german government has still not made a decision on whether it will subsidize diesel-powered cars outfitted with particulate filters .
on monday , a summit between top players from europe 's car industry and german chancellor gerhard schröder dealt with the topic as well as the general competitiveness of the auto industry .
but german government spokesman bela anda said after the meeting that a decision on the particulate filters would take some time .
diesel cars are common in europe because the fuel is less heavily taxed than petrol .
but since diesel engines generate significantly higher emissions and the fine particles contained in them are suspected of causing cancer and respiratory ailments , german environment minister jürgen trittin is pushing to subsidize clean diesel cars by as much as € 600 -lrb- $ 740 -rrb- per year starting 2005 .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 .

la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tourism is already well developed there .
plus , during the games there will probably be less beach tourism as people decide not to go this year fearing it will be too crowed , " jeanrenaud said . still , jeanrenaud said the portuguese economy could increase its economic benefits should the country 's national team , which is a tournament favourite , manage to will euro 2004 . " it ’ s hard to put a figure on it in monetary terms , of course .

peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.06.2004 portugal hopes for euro economic bonus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal invested over € 650 million in ten stadiums .
when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .
but the tourists are only one aspect of the competition 's economic impact . " the importance of the tournament for portugal is undeniable and it will have important effects in the sporting life and in the economic and touristic activities of all the host cities , " porto mayor rui rio told the official euro 2004 website . though it has become de rigueur for the hosts of major sporting events to tout the economic benefits , measuring it all can be tricky .
while increased numbers of tourists and extra construction and infrastructure spending is easy to quantify , there are also several intangible factors , such as the heightened " visibility " of a host country or city . according to one study commissioned by uefa , portugal will reap around € 800 million in immediate benefits from euro 2004 , including income , promotional value and tourism .
some € 244 million has been poured into the country 's construction industry alone , creating jobs in the sector and boosting wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porto , portugal the study said portugal can expect an increase in annual tourism revenue of between € 179-357 million in the years following the tournament .
the added tourism will create an estimated 14,000 new jobs , which in turn will bring around € 200 million into the economy . but all of those figures ca n't assuage the concerns of some worried that portugal , which has faced recession and rising unemployment in recent years , is unable to afford what it has spent on the competition . massive investments for example , some € 650 million were pumped into building and renovating the ten stadiums to be used for the competition , even though many are likely to be underused after the european championship moves on .
in total , portugal is spending an estimated € 4 billion in the run-up to the tournament . besides the stadium costs , large sums were spent on high-speed rail links and other infrastructure . " it 's been a big investment for a small country , " luis arnaut , the government minister in charge of sports , told the associated press .
" it 's one of the greatest financial outlays ever in portugal . " a recent poll by portuguese rtp television showed around half of those asked did not believe hosting euro 2004 was worth the investment .
some experts on the economics of sporting events share the public 's skepticism . " during the competition there is of course a short boost , but after the games there 's not going to be much left , " prof. claude jeanrenaud from the university of neuchâtel in switzerland told dw-world .
" the long-term effect will likely be very small . " impact on tourism jeanrenaud said although euro 2004 would greatly raise portugal 's profile internationally , one could not assume the benefits would be solely positive for the country 's important tourism sector .

when portugal hosts this year 's european championship this summer , thousands of visiting soccer fans will spend plenty of euros .
that 's good for the economy , but the longer-term impact of the tournament is less clear . portugal is about to experience the planet 's biggest sporting spectacle barring , or course , the world cup and the olympics .
for three weeks , fans from across europe will travel to the country to support their teams and soak up the atmosphere of euro 2004 .
during their stay they will splash out an estimated € 260 million -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- on tickets for matches , hotels , food and countless other items . with a portuguese population of only 10 million , the hordes of visitors will bring a significant boost to the economy .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .

in an event-filled day , he visited a british military cemetery , where he laid a wreath for the allied soldiers killed in the battle and another for the 322 unknown german soldiers buried at the same spot .
explaining the decision to join the 60th anniversary victory celebrations in normandy , schröder said of germany : " in germany , we know who caused the war .
we 're aware of our responsibility and take it seriously . "
in many ways , it seemed almost like a celebration of recently improved franco-german relations .
" the french receive you as a brother , " french president jacques chirac , who took the initiative to invite schröder , said .
the gesture was followed by an embrace .
united in death in his speech given at the international peace memorial in the city of caen , schröder also sought to underscore what germany and its erstwhile enemies had in common in world war ii .
" german soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to oppress europe , " he said .
" yet in their death the soldiers on both sides were united - in the grieving of their parents and wives , brothers and sisters .
their pain unites us all . "
schröder added that the allies liberated not only france , but also germany from the nazis .
" no one will forget the terrible record of hitler 's 12-year tyranny , " the chancellor said .
" my generation grew up in its shadow .
my father 's grave was found only four years ago .
he was a soldier killed in romania .
i never got the chance to know him . "
the chancellor said his visit to the d-day festivities marked the end of the postwar period .
" it is not that old germany of darker years that i am here to represent , " he said .
" my country has returned to the community of civilized nations .
it was a long haul . "
" europe has learned its lesson , and we germans will certainly not forget it , " schroeder said .
" europe 's citizens and its politicians carry the responsibility so that war-mongering , war crimes and terrorism will have no chance elsewhere either . "
president chirac , in his own address , said d-day " marks above all the renewal of liberty and of democracy on a european continent oppressed under the yoke of nazi ideology and its murderous madness . "
criticism back home schröder 's itinerary in france drew criticism from some quarters in germany .
peter ramsauer , a member of german parliament with the conservative christian social union party , said the fact that schröder did not plan to visit the military cemetery at la cambe , where 21,000 german soldiers are buried , was an " insult " to the mens ' widows .
la cambe remains a sensitive issue in both germany and france because it is also the site where 5,000 ss soldiers and high officers are buried .
many of them participated in one of the darkest chapters of the war in france : the unexplained decimation of an entire village and the massacre of hundreds of french men , women and children in the village of oradour-sur-glane .
german foreign minister joschka fischer sharply criticized the salvos from the opposition , describing them as " unspeakable attacks on the chancellor " that were intended to " invalidate the historic gesture of the french president and people " to invite the german leader .
he added that schröder would honor the german dead , but " not those who were guilty of the worst crimes , " like those responsible for the grizzly oradour-sur-glane massacre .
a model of reconciliation but sorrows like the events at oradour sur-glane are painful memories of the past .
once sworn enemies , germany and france now hold arguably closer ties than any other countries in europe - a testament to difficult years of postwar reconciliation .
" i wanted germany to remember with us those hours when the ideal of freedom returned to our continent , " chirac said on sunday .
" franco-german reconciliation shows the world that hatred has no future , that peace is always possible .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .

china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 07.06.2004 a platform for protest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sending a clear message in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows . from birmingham to evian , seattle to davos , wherever leaders from the leading industrial nations get together to discuss economics and politics , protests and marches are never far away .
in the last five years , the number of demonstrations has grown as anti-globalization activists swelled the ranks of local peace rallies .
the level of violence has also increased , culminating in violent street clashes and the death of a protestor in genua , italy , in july 2001 .
dw-world has put together a chronology of the biggest protests in the last five years .
may 1998 , birmingham : protesting for the poor some 50,000 protestors descended on the british city during the two-day g-8 summit from may 15 to 17 .
organized by " jubilee 2000 , " a coalition of british development groups and charities , they demonstrated for debt forgiveness for the world 's poorest countries .
june 1999 , cologne : christians for peace a year after birmingham , the double summit of the g-8 and the european union took place without any major protests .
around 40,000 peace activists , coordinated by the leftist " aktionsbündnis köln 99 " -lrb- action group for cologne -rrb- and christian organizations gathered in the city on the rhine river for various demonstrations .
november 1999 , seattle : globalization escalates the conference of the world trade organization in the northern pacific city marked the first of several major anti-globalization protests .
more than 50,000 international protestors from labor unions , environmental groups and human rights watchdogs took to the streets in the name of fair trade between the industrial world and developing countries .
after violent clashes with police and security forces broke out , the city declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew .
protestors were arrested , the police were allowed to use tear gas and shoot rubber bullets in actions the demonstrators said violated their right to freedom of expression .
anti-globalization became the buzz word for the duration of the conference and has since established its presence on the sidelines of every wto and g-8 meeting .
april 2000 , washington : the world breathes easily again from april 16 to 18 , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank met in the u.s. capital .
but despite being the primary targets of anti-globalization critics , the conferences took place without unrest .
after the experience in seattle , the city was braced for dealing with angry protests and violence .
instead , only 20,000 protestors turned out for peaceful demonstrations .
september 2000 , prague : numerous arrests although only 9,000 demonstrators gathered in the czech capital for the joint meeting of the world bank and the imf , the protests erupted into violence , and the police cracked down , arresting several people .
december 2000 , nice : fighting globalization the eu summit in the southern french city started peacefully with some 4,000 anti-globalization activists protesting in front of the downtown congress center .
later , however , the demonstrations erupted into street clashes .
january 2001 , davos : world economic forum the annual meeting of business leaders , economic think tanks and heads of state offered a traditional protest platform for anti-globalization activists .
massive police contingents , however , successfully prevented 1,300 demonstrators from sabotaging the 31st world economic forum in the exclusive swiss ski retreat .
may 2001 , quebec : street battles on the sidelines from may 20 to 23 , the canadian city staged the third america summit .
the meeting of the pan-american free trade association was accompanied by 25,000 demonstrators .
the largely peaceful protests were occasionally interrupted with street clashes with the police .
june 2001 , gothenburg : vandals lay waste to downtown the eu summit on june 15 and 16 attracted more than 20,000 protestors to the swedish city .
although the majority of them were peaceful , some 700 vandals destroyed downtown , turning the city center into a battlefield between police and angry protestors .
july 2001 , salzburg : violent minority about 300 people were to blame for turning the world economic forum on eastern europe into a violent uprising after a peaceful rally kicked off the austrian conference with a positive note .
july 2001 , genua : death casts shadow over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator is subdued by riot police during clashes between protesters and police in downtown genoa , italy , friday , july 20 , 2001 .
tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the g-8 summit .
one demonstrator was killed .
the g-8 summit on july 21 and 22 rocketed the italian city to the nightly news after a protestor was brutally beaten and killed during the worst clashes between anti-globalization activists and police in the group of eight 's history .
the images of street battles , burning cars and vandalized cafes cast a long shadow over the conference and left a stronger impression than the actual political agenda .
may 2002 , kananaskis : peaceful mountain retreat the canadian rockies were the site of the 2002 g-8 summit .
selected for its remote location , which consisted of not much more than an exclusive hotel , kananaskis was easily sealed off from protestors and patrolled by a huge contingent of police and military .
demonstrations took place 80 kilometers away in calgary .
june 2003 , evian : protesting out of country last year 's g-8 summit was hosted by france , whose president , jacques chirac , selected the location on lake geneva because it could be easily secured .
the demonstrations - at times violent - took place in the nearby swiss town of geneva , where numerous international organizations such as the u.n. and wto have headquarters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de evian braces for protests as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g-8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

reverting back to the shaven headed look of 2001 , the england captain will not be the focus of these european championships when it comes to tresses .
gone are the extreme mohawks of the pre-world cup games of 2002 and the rooster cut of the tournament itself , becks will have to stand aside this time to let a new king of the coiffeur take center stage in portugal .
but who could carry such a weight ?
beckham was more than man enough to take on the mantle once held by ruud gullit 's rasta mop , the perennial perm of rudi völler and the rat tail of roberto baggio .
in fact , no other footballer has ever inspired so many copycat hair atrocities .
there were even reports that female fans in japan were styling their pubic hair in the style of the becks mohawk .
sadly , there seems to be very few stars at euro 2004 willing to let their hair down or inspire trends to such an extreme .
the majority of the northern european players look all very tidy but ever so boring with their trainee police officer short-back-and-sides haircuts .
even the wild man look of spain 's carles puyol and the glossy latin locks of the italian boys pale into insignificance compared to the " cornrows " sported by mr. posh on england 's south african tour last year .
maybe someone like veteran latvia defender mihails zemlinskis , with his eastern european " soccer shocker " mullet , could play prince regent until a worthy successor comes along .
the football may end up being breath-taking in portugal but euro 2004 looks set to be devoid of any hair-inspired highlights . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

reverting back to the shaven headed look of 2001 , the england captain will not be the focus of these european championships when it comes to tresses .
gone are the extreme mohawks of the pre-world cup games of 2002 and the rooster cut of the tournament itself , becks will have to stand aside this time to let a new king of the coiffeur take center stage in portugal .
but who could carry such a weight ?
beckham was more than man enough to take on the mantle once held by ruud gullit 's rasta mop , the perennial perm of rudi völler and the rat tail of roberto baggio .
in fact , no other footballer has ever inspired so many copycat hair atrocities .
there were even reports that female fans in japan were styling their pubic hair in the style of the becks mohawk .
sadly , there seems to be very few stars at euro 2004 willing to let their hair down or inspire trends to such an extreme .
the majority of the northern european players look all very tidy but ever so boring with their trainee police officer short-back-and-sides haircuts .
even the wild man look of spain 's carles puyol and the glossy latin locks of the italian boys pale into insignificance compared to the " cornrows " sported by mr. posh on england 's south african tour last year .
maybe someone like veteran latvia defender mihails zemlinskis , with his eastern european " soccer shocker " mullet , could play prince regent until a worthy successor comes along .
the football may end up being breath-taking in portugal but euro 2004 looks set to be devoid of any hair-inspired highlights . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the court ruled that victor scherdizki had misappropriated around € 2 million as the director of a bank in ukraine in 1995 as a result of which german government compensation for former forced laborers in ukraine could not be paid .
an accomplice of scherdizki has also been sentenced to four years and three months in prison .

reverting back to the shaven headed look of 2001 , the england captain will not be the focus of these european championships when it comes to tresses .
gone are the extreme mohawks of the pre-world cup games of 2002 and the rooster cut of the tournament itself , becks will have to stand aside this time to let a new king of the coiffeur take center stage in portugal .
but who could carry such a weight ?
beckham was more than man enough to take on the mantle once held by ruud gullit 's rasta mop , the perennial perm of rudi völler and the rat tail of roberto baggio .
in fact , no other footballer has ever inspired so many copycat hair atrocities .
there were even reports that female fans in japan were styling their pubic hair in the style of the becks mohawk .
sadly , there seems to be very few stars at euro 2004 willing to let their hair down or inspire trends to such an extreme .
the majority of the northern european players look all very tidy but ever so boring with their trainee police officer short-back-and-sides haircuts .
even the wild man look of spain 's carles puyol and the glossy latin locks of the italian boys pale into insignificance compared to the " cornrows " sported by mr. posh on england 's south african tour last year .
maybe someone like veteran latvia defender mihails zemlinskis , with his eastern european " soccer shocker " mullet , could play prince regent until a worthy successor comes along .
the football may end up being breath-taking in portugal but euro 2004 looks set to be devoid of any hair-inspired highlights . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

germany lost 0-2 to hungary on sunday in their last preparation match before euro 2004 begins in portugal this weekend .
it was an embarrassing farewell to home soil for the team which leaves for the finals on wednesday . germany 's fans left the stadium in kaiserslautern on sunday sporting long , miserable faces .
their team had just lost its final preparation match for the european championships 0-2 against hungary . in other circumstances , the solemnity could have been explained as a reaction to a beloved 's farewell as the german team waved goodbye and headed on its imminent portuguese adventure .
but if some fans were mourning the departure of their heroes , it was wasted emotion .
if the germans play like this in portugal , it wo n't be long before they 're back home again . in a match that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1954 world cup final played between these sides , a match the unfancied germans won 3-2 in switzerland , the current german side never looked like they could emulate the " miracle of bern " against a hungarian team rumoured to made up of fringe players and the walking wounded . coached by german legend lothar matthäus , the man who captained his nation to world cup glory in 1990 and eventually set a record for international appearances for germany , hungary looked far from a makeshift side .
from the first whistle , germany 's defenders were thrown into confusion and disarray as hungarian striker sandor torghelle proved to be a handful for the home side .
german defense in disarray bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn was once again on the losing side .
the pressure looked to be paying off as early as the first minute when the german defenders andreas hinkel and jens nowotny attempted to play the offside trap only for torghelle to race between them and bear down on the oliver kahn 's goal .
only the german captain 's leg stopped the hungarians going ahead with barely a minute on the clock .
germany were soon under the cosh again as the hungarians continued to swarm forward , buoyed by their early flourish .
torghelle once again capitalized on the dithering in defense to swivel past christian worns and put the guests ahead after seven minutes with already his third shot on goal .
early lessons go unheeded possibly fired with the flames of revenge which still burn from that world cup final half a century ago , the hungarians refused to let up and swarmed over the germans as they grabbed control of the match .
hungary 's hold tightened just after the half hour when torghelle again inflicted the damage , finishing off a lightning fast counter-attack to put the visitors further ahead on 31 minutes .
mkk budapest 's torghelle almost increased hungary 's lead on 56 minutes , this time as provider , but his team mate zoltan gera was unable to reproduce his fellow striker 's clinical shooting in front of goal and sliced his shot wide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler tries to bring order to the chaos .
while germany fought back strongly in the latter stages of the second half , it was not enough to prise control away from hungary who looked assured and never in danger of letting a two-goal lead slip .
despite a competent midfield , germany offered little ahead of them and any invention attempted by michael ballack and bernd schneider was stifled by a sea of red shirts in the final third of the pitch .
chances go begging for home side germany did have chances to cut the deficit .
early in the second half schneider fired in a low cross that fredi bobic nearly diverted into the hungary goal with a cheeky back heel that went inches wide .
the three-times world and european champions almost halved hungary 's lead through a ballack header on 53 minutes but were denied by just one of a string a great saves from hungary goalkeeper gabor kiraly .
philipp lahm also provided opportunities for his team mates but his final ball into the box often lacked precision and brdaric was twice unable to connect with the young stuttgart player 's crosses .
improvements needed - and fast in the end , it was all in vain .
the fans jeered the german players from the pitch , a sound that could well be ringing around the stadium in porto on june 15 after germany 's first test of the european championships against the netherlands unless things radically improve .
the 7-0 victory over malta last week now appears to have been an anomaly .
germany prepares for euro 2004 with increasing evidence justifying doubts over the team 's quality .
the fans and critics will now hang onto their hopes that germany will once again prove everyone wrong in the context of real competition and that the " tournament mentality " will eventually win through . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

gm said it would spend $ 3bn in an effort to double its capacity in china over the next three years .
the move comes despite fears that china 's fast-growing economy could face an abrupt slowdown in the months ahead .
phil murtaugh , head of gm 's china unit , said the firm remained " highly confident " in the chinese car market .
" with the world 's fastest-growing vehicle market , success in china is crucial to gm 's global success , " he said .
" these investments will enable us to maintain our leadership position by growing with the market . "
boom time gm has previously said china is on course to overtake the uk and canada as its second biggest market after the us this year .
the $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.68bn -rrb- cash injection will be spread across gm 's chinese operations in an effort to raise annual production capacity to 1.3 million vehicles , roughly double its current level .
the company also plans to introduce about 20 new or upgraded models in china over the next three years , most of them locally-made .
not all analysts cheered the deal , however .
krsh bhaskar , of the motor industry research unit , told the bbc 's world business report that china partnerships have a tendency not to last in the long term .
" i expect that some , or all , of the relationships between a western and a chinese partner will come unstuck , and the chinese will go it alone , " he said .
rapid growth nonetheless , china 's booming economy and fast-rising average income levels have fuelled bumper car sales in recent years , encouraging foreign car makers to beef up their operations in the country .
gm 's own chinese car sales rose to 178,000 in the first four months of 2004 , a 56 % increase on the same period last year .
but the chinese government has warned that the local car industry may have over-expanded , with capacity set to reach 14 million vehicles a year against demand of just 7 million by 2007 .
analysts have also raised concerns that china 's booming economy - which grew at a rate of nearly 10 % in the first quarter - may overheat , triggering a potentially devastating crash .
earlier this year , beijing said it planned to rein in growth to more sustainable levels by imposing tougher checks on borrowing to fund investment projects .

alan turing was one of the pioneers of computer science , and his work helped make the modern pc a reality .
he was also one of the secret code breakers working at bletchley park during the second world war .
he killed himself on 7 june 1954 , by eating an apple he laced with cyanide .

enigma buster it was his idea of creating a machine to turn thought processes into binary numbers which was one of the key turning points in the history of the computer .
his revolutionary idea was for a machine that would read a series of ones and zeros from a tape .
these described the steps needed to solve a problem or task .
turing 's experiments are credited with helping britain win world war ii by deciphering encrypted german communications , helping the allies remain one step ahead .
oestrogen injections but his brilliance would not protect him from the social values of 1950s britain , and he was taken to court because he was gay .
at the time , homosexuality was outlawed in the uk , and when turing 's relationship with a young manchester man was discovered in 1952 , he was threatened with jail .
instead , he agreed to be injected with oestrogen for a year , in an attempt to curb his libido .
he was also denied work with gchq , the successor to bletchley park , because of his sexual orientation .
two years after his conviction he ended his life by eating the poisoned apple .
he was discovered by his cleaner one day later .
his mother believed he had accidentally taken the cyanide after an experiment , but it is generally accepted he deliberately concocted the experiment so she could believe that .
turing honoured turing may not be a household name , but his achievements have been recognised .
a road has been named after him in manchester , where he lived for the latter years of his life when he joined manchester university .
there is also a bronze statue of him in sackville park in the city 's gay village , where he sits on a bench , apple in hand .
he has even featured in a doctor who book .

alan turing was one of the pioneers of computer science , and his work helped make the modern pc a reality .

oestrogen injections but his brilliance would not protect him from the social values of 1950s britain , and he was taken to court because he was gay .
at the time , homosexuality was outlawed in the uk , and when turing 's relationship with a young manchester man was discovered in 1952 , he was threatened with jail .
instead , he agreed to be injected with oestrogen for a year , in an attempt to curb his libido .
he was also denied work with gchq , the successor to bletchley park , because of his sexual orientation .

there is also a bronze statue of him in sackville park in the city 's gay village , where he sits on a bench , apple in hand .

the average home in the province is now worth £ 106,574 , an increase of just over 2 % on the previous university of ulster quarterly house price index survey .
the report , published on monday in conjunction with the bank of ireland and the housing executive , indicates that prices went up 8.6 % over the year .
its authors , professor alastair adair , professor stanley mcgreal and suzanne allen , said this was a " steady if unspectacular rise " .
based on a sample of 1,921 open market transactions in a range of house types , the first quarter is traditionally a quieter period for house sales .
average regional prices northern ireland : £ 106,574 belfast : £ 105,037 north down : £ 114,527 lisburn : £ 127,537 east antrim : £ 91,616 londonderry / strabane : £ 89,451 antrim / ballymena : £ 102,555 coleraine / limavady / north coast : £ 102,485 fermanagh / south tyrone : £ 113,775 mid ulster : £ 112,804 mid and south down : £ 110,308 craigavon / armagh : £ 107,315 south belfast remained the most expensive area with an average price of £ 127,987 , closely followed by lisburn , while across the city , north belfast was the cheapest with prices averaging £ 84,567 .
semi-detached homes were the best performing sector , with an average price of £ 100,448 - the first time it had exceeded the £ 100,000 barrier .
it represented 29 % of the survey .
terraced houses also made up 29 % of the survey , performing strongly with an average of £ 76,389 , up by almost 9 % .
this strong price growth in what are regarded as entry points into the housing market suggested that demand levels remained good , according to the report .

international air travel association -lrb- iata -rrb- chief giovanni bisignani said high fuel costs could push the industry into the red yet again .
he told iata 's annual meeting that its earlier forecasts looked optimistic .
" our projections of a $ 3bn profit were based on an average oil price of $ 30 a barrel , " he said .
" if oil prices average $ 33 , we break even .
at $ 36 , we could expect three billion dollar losses . "
so far this year , average world oil prices are up by 30 % compared with 2003 , lifted by surging demand , supply bottlenecks at us refineries , and fears that conflict in the middle east could disrupt supplies .
light sweet crude for july delivery - the benchmark for us oil prices - was trading at $ 38.36 on monday morning , having touched record highs of over $ 42 last week .
apocalyptic warning mr bisignani described this year 's jump in oil prices as the airline industry 's " fifth horseman of the apocalypse . "
high fuel prices could cut profits by £ 4m easyjet budget airline 's fuel warning " last year , we survived the four horsemen of the apocalypse - sars , conflict in iraq , terrorism , and the -lrb- depressed -rrb- economy . "
" but a fifth horseman , the price of oil , could add up to $ 1bn per month to our costs , and deny us profitability yet again . "
the airline sector has faced the most turbulent period in its history over the last three years , racking up accumulated losses of about $ 30bn , according to iata .
the slump began with a steep fall in passenger numbers in the wake of the 11 september attacks , and has been prolonged by the iraq war and the outbreak of the deadly sars virus .
according to iata figures , passenger numbers fell for the third consecutive year in 2003 , dipping by 0.6 % compared with 2002 .
the air travel slump has forced several global airlines into bankruptcy , and many others have been saved from collapse only by government assistance .
iata has recommended that airlines levy a surcharge on intercontinental flights to offset higher fuel costs .
many leading carriers , including british airways , singapore airlines , and australia 's qantas , have already done so .
iata members attending its annual conference in singapore also agreed to introduce full electronic ticketing by 2007 as a cost-cutting measure .
iata represents more than 270 airlines accounting for 98 % of international scheduled air traffic .
