but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .

butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .

" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "

whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .

-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .

" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .
silvio meissner converted the penalty shot in the waning seconds of the game for the final result .
leverkusen slipped to sixth place in the bundesliga , while stuttgart kept pace with first place team wolfsburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live politik direkt - das politikmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "
but the architect has a more immediate worry : " i 'm a schumacher fan , so i really hope he wins on sunday .

bmw and mercedes are also in competition for the world title and as the season begins , it seems anything goes in the pursuit of glory .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .

in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .

tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .

the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .
silvio meissner converted the penalty shot in the waning seconds of the game for the final result .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2004 being turkish and gay in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay pride and the turkish community do n't always mix germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .
but of course , being gay and being muslim , is very problematic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2004 business ' elixir of life ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is key for germany to regain its innovative edge with high wages and a vast social welfare system , innovation is especially important to retain the standard of living in countries like germany .
but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .
and there , i have the same opinion as bolkestein : we do n't need that .

the military facility is scheduled to be up an running by january next year .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .

kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .

bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ?

instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .

he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .

" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.09.2004 stuttgart sends leverkusen spiraling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hleb and stuttgart owned the midfield since outclassing real madrid in the champion 's league two weeks ago , bayer leverkusen has been a shadow of its former self .
in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .

but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .
and there , i have the same opinion as bolkestein : we do n't need that .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .

but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .
but of course , being gay and being muslim , is very problematic .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .
but of course , being gay and being muslim , is very problematic .

" if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .

and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .

he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "
but the architect has a more immediate worry : " i 'm a schumacher fan , so i really hope he wins on sunday .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.09.2004 business ' elixir of life ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research is key for germany to regain its innovative edge with high wages and a vast social welfare system , innovation is especially important to retain the standard of living in countries like germany .
but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .
and there , i have the same opinion as bolkestein : we do n't need that .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .

but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .
and there , i have the same opinion as bolkestein : we do n't need that .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi , left , smiles as he shakes hands with eu commission president romano prodi at the eu commission headquarters in brussels , tuesday april 27 , 2004 .
the deal has been billed as another significant step for libya as it tries to end 30 yeas of international isolation , during which the west accused gadhafi of sponsoring international terrorism .
the first step came earlier in the year when the eu decided to begin considering negotiations with libya over resuming trade relations as part of a cooperation partnership between europe and north africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2004 being turkish and gay in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay pride and the turkish community do n't always mix germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .
but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .
german mechanical engineering continues to stand its ground against the competition and regularly produces top exports .
the frequent argument that elite american universities , such as the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , are far superior to germany 's universities does n't necessarily hold water in this area . " when i look at colleagues in my field , they have a fraction of the equipment that we have in aachen , " said günther schuh , a professor at aachen 's prestigious institute of technology .
" if you gave an mit production engineer the choice , he would always go to germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been able to reatain its reputation for excellent engineering but schuh was critical of the german mechanical engineering industry , which he said had shifted too much production to eastern europe and china to avoid paying higher german wages .
he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .

though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .

" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .
all flights from germany to shanghai are full .
" the image effect is unbeatable , " said steffen hezinger , one of the initiators of formula 1 racing in shanghai .
" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .
" racing circuits are sports facilities and there has always been , and there always will be money for them , wherever it comes from , " tilke said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher says the shanghai circuit is " quite a challenge . "
but the architect has a more immediate worry : " i 'm a schumacher fan , so i really hope he wins on sunday .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .

kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .

that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .

but what vision do politicians and business people need to encourage it ? " if we do n't have more competition , we will never be able to keep up against the american , japanese and chinese producers , " said outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein -lrb- photo , below -rrb- in düsseldorf .
" competition is business ' elixir of life . "
bolkestein called for a return to " good , old values , " competition and an end to paranoia . his words set the tone at a seminar this week called " innovation - germany 's key to the future : which visions guide business and politics ? " organized by several german chambers of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein but this elixir is missing from germany 's research community , contended gerlinde drache , whose company makes filters for environmental technology .
" one accepts healthy competition in sports .
it 's not accepted in science and learning .
and that 's what we need , " drache told conference participants . universities crucial universities are a hot issue in any discussion about innovation in germany .
no country can create top international universities and at the same time cling to 19th century structures , stressed hermann lübbert , a professor in bochum and the ceo of biotech and pharmaceutical firm biofrontera . " the fact that we do n't have any private universities does n't allow universities to just try out different things as a private university would : to concentrate on certain fields , to increase tuition fees and to finance themselves entirely differently than a public university can , " lübbert said .
" one should really consider simply privatizing a few big universities . " excellent research is possible in germany without private universities , lübbert said , but it 's not a given at every institute of higher learning .
instead of insisting on germany 's traditional - and , according to lübbert , obsolete - system which combines research with learning , studies could concentrate on core competencies .
important research would then only be done at top universities , which would be better equipped and able to more easily put their developments on the market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost its position as a leader in pharmaceuticals lübbert used pharmaceuticals as an example .
twenty years ago , germany was widely viewed as the " world 's pharmacy . "
now , however , it 's no longer one of the top developers of medication . not a panacea for all ills but it 's a different story in other fields .

he blamed germany 's collective bargaining system that leaves it to management and trade unions to negotiation wages for entire sectors , not just for individual companies . changing collective bargaining schuh recommended that management dissolve its side of the negotiations so that unions would n't have anyone to negotiate with .
alternatively , he suggested , the two parties could accept a third negotiating partner representing unemployed people . " our two bargaining parties do n't seem to be impressed by the growing numbers of unemployed people , " schuh said .
" but they should be .
they should look more frequently at the faces of the poor people who , through no fault of their own , have lost their jobs .
then they would find other solutions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members on strike in germany schuh said the result would be a sort of basic salary .
employees would work more or less according to the number of contracts and earn more or less according to their company 's success . the prerequisites for innovation - private universities , separating research and learning , company-based wage agreements and variable salaries and work hours - indeed reflected bolkestein 's call for a return to economically liberal values . günther schuh , however , stressed that the state should not withdraw entirely .
" give the companies space , let them run onto the market .
and do n't run them off the path with restrictions and sugar-coated subsidies , " schuh advised .
" politicians think that they 're better than the market .
and there , i have the same opinion as bolkestein : we do n't need that .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .
we wish that people would come out earlier , but this is n't the case in the turkish community .

pay up or face the consequences , berlin said . the german government is tired of waiting for libya 's moammar gadhafi to follow through with a pledge to pay compensation to the victims of the 1986 la belle disco bombing .
a government spokesman said on saturday chancellor gerhard schröder would cancel a visit to tripoli next month if the first installment of the $ 35 -lrb- € 28.5 -rrb- million agreed to in august for the 160 victims of the berlin bombing is not made .
the one-day meeting between schröder and gadhafi was agreed to after libya signed an agreement in late august stating that it would pay $ 15 million in compensation by sept .
8 .
" honoring the la belle compensation agreement is the precondition for the resumption of german-libyan relations , " the government spokesman said , but added he was confident the money would be paid .
according to der spiegel newsmagazine , the german foreign ministry had summoned libya 's ambassador to berlin twice during the previous week to ask for the payment as promised .
tripoli , however , blamed the delay on technical problems in transferring the funds .
making amends a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service was behind the bombing of the disco in west berlin , in which two americans and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 people injured .
it convicted four people of carrying out the bombing .
as a result of the ruling , libya was required to pay compensation .
the payment agreed to tripoli and berlin covers non-us victims only .
payouts to us victims and their families are subject to separate legal action in the united states .

the deal has been billed as another significant step for libya as it tries to end 30 yeas of international isolation , during which the west accused gadhafi of sponsoring international terrorism .
the first step came earlier in the year when the eu decided to begin considering negotiations with libya over resuming trade relations as part of a cooperation partnership between europe and north africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.09.2004 stuttgart sends leverkusen spiraling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander hleb and stuttgart owned the midfield since outclassing real madrid in the champion 's league two weeks ago , bayer leverkusen has been a shadow of its former self .
in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .
silvio meissner converted the penalty shot in the waning seconds of the game for the final result .
leverkusen slipped to sixth place in the bundesliga , while stuttgart kept pace with first place team wolfsburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in a high-profile game against stuttgart saturday , they continued their spiral . the matchup was heralded as the bundesliga 's game of the week but someone forgot to tell bayer leverkusen .
the team , reeling since playing magical soccer against real madrid two weeks ago , had nothing much to show for itself and suffered a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of second-place vfb stuttgart in the gottlieb-daimler stadium on saturday . both teams were looking for a sign of life out of this game .
stuttgart failed to capture the top of the bundesliga table and looked flat in their 0:0 game against hertha berlin last week .
bayer leverkusen managed only a 2:2 against fc nuremberg last week , and was eliminated from the league cup on wednesday by last year 's champions werder bremen .
stuttgart 's control of the midfield led to their first goal , set up by a direct kick after a foul on andreas hinkel along the top of the penalty box line .
the game had initially been up for grabs , with neither team taking the initiative in the opening ten minutes , which took place in pouring rain .
lahm opens scoring stuttgart gave a taste of what was coming , though , when brazlian jeronimo cacau sent a flat shot from the left side past leverkusen goalie jörg butt .
only the goalpost kept cacau and stuttgart from taking the lead .
four minutes later , alexander hleb lined up to take the direct kick .
butt managed to box it to the right of his goal , but phillip lahm was there and fired it from 16 meters out on the right side into the bottom right corner of the net for the 1-0 .
stuttgart continued their control of the midfield , as bayer failed to come up with any noteworthy offensive plays .
bernd schneider found the outstretched foot of his striker dimitri berbatov but the weak shot was gathered up easily by timo hildebrandt .
leverkusen had to wait 40 minutes to get their first corner .
" we slept through the first half " a minute later , stuttgart countered fiercely .
hinkel , one of the side 's noteworthy players , charged down the right side of the field .
his hard shot deflected off a leverkusen player for a corner kick . the kick found the head of martin stranzl , who jumped higher than goalie butt to tap it in from close to the right baseline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl , right , und cacau celebrate stranzl 's goal to make it 2:0 " we slept through the first half , " bayer coach klaus augenthaler said after the game .
" the commitment and conviction to get something going was simply missing . "
though exhibiting brief signs of life at the beginning of the second half , leverkusen failed to set up any serious shots on goal .
as the second half ticked away , bayer 's lackadaisical first half hurt them more and more .
the spark came from stuttgart , whose players were better rested after playing back most of the second half in defense .
after hard charges and shots from christian tiffert were parried away and gathered up by butt , hleb set up the last goal of the game when he was taken down in the penalty box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.09.2004 lord of the rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new playing field for germany 's most creative asphalt designer when racing drivers roar around the new formula 1 circuit in shanghai , the german architect hermann tilke will be the toast of the town .
the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .

tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "
designed for speed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher races in the grand prix from australia the shanghai track is designed for speed and to challenge the drivers like no circuit before it .
the start and finish areas , for instance , are followed by a combination of curves that compress the field instead of drawing it out , " otherwise the excitement would be gone right after the first round , " tilke explained his design theory .
plus , the field has to offer overtaking possibilities .
and there have to be difficult stretches for drivers to make mistakes - that increases the suspense .
" if you build ups and downs into the track , for example , sometimes the weight comes off the front axle so proper steering is no longer possible .
if the driver is then following a wrong line or runs into a curve a bit too fast , the car threatens to go out of control , " he said .
and that 's what the fans want to see .
too often the races end without any drama , tilke lamented .
the european circuits have been driven so often that many of them have become like routine .
the shanghai track is completely new ; the drivers have to really get used to it first .
the new face of china the spectators are expected to flock in numbers to the track , which is being seen as a real boost to the local economy .
all the good hotels in the region are already booked up .

" unlike the olympics which will be in beijing , motor sport and formula 1 take place annually .
travelers to china will include racing in their programs .
it 's all going to add to the numbers , " he said .
bernie ecclestone , the financial manager behind formula 1 and the impetus behind the shanghai circuit , praised tilke 's track , saying the world had never seen anything like it before .
" did you see the athens olympics ?
that was nice , " he quipped to reporters , " but nothing compared to this . "
next stop : istanbul as for tilke , while the chinese track is being christened with the first race , he 'll be continuing work on another formula 1 project : the 2005 istanbul grand prix .
whether in the desert , the jungle or in a swamp , whenever tilke builds a new track , it means an older one has to be closed down to keep the number of formula 1 races from surpassing the restricted 17 a year .
that does n't bother tilke , nor does he see it as a threat to his own future .

the designer has made it his mission to thrill spectators with high-speed tracks . only a few months ago , the aachen based civil engineer and architect watched as his bahrain track was inaugurated as the first formula 1 circuit in the middle east .
on sunday , tilke 's second major racing project of the year will attract even more attention as the most expensive of all motor tracks opens with engines roaring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he lives for speed , curves and drama on the race track called the " lord of the rings , " or the " creative director of the asphalt branch , " tilke is the most sought-after designer of racetracks in the world .
wherever michael schumacher and co. whiz past at speeds of more than 300 km / h -lrb- 180 mph -rrb- , tilke 's design team has been at work .
the shanghai spectacle the shanghai international circuit is a futuristic mega project constructed with an eye for the newest in road-building technology and architectural aesthetics .
built largely of aluminum , glass and steel , the impressive complex of viewing towers , media center and electronically equipped grandstands surpasses anything motor sporting has seen before , including all the big-name circuits in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahrain 's formula 1 circuit saw its first action in april 2004 tilke 's shanghai track , the fourth major racecourse he 's designed after malaysia , turkey and bahrain , has the potential to set several records .
already , it is the biggest of the formula 1 complexes , with seating for 200,000 spectators .
-lrb- bahrain is the second largest with room for 150,000 viewers . -rrb-
at nearly $ 300 million -lrb- roughly € 240 million -rrb- , the chinese grand prix stretch is also the most expensive track ever built .
from the air , the 5.45 km -lrb- 3.39 mile -rrb- track with its five left and five right curves and a long stretch for passing , resembles the chinese character " shang , " which means uplifting or spectacular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5.45 kilometers of curves and tricks for the world 's best drivers surpassing expectations not only the sleek modern design bears resemblance to the chinese word , but also the speed at which tilke and his 120-member crew managed to complete building on the project .
in just 18 months the circuit rose up out of the swampy waste land outside shanghai , far exceeding the most optimistic of expectations .
" initially we were shocked , " tilke said , describing the first reaction upon seeing the site , which is located above a deep swamp .
" building a surface on that for formula 1 cars doing 300 km / h is a real challenge , " he recalled .
but tilke devised a plan to essentially float the track on 40,000 concrete posts , which he rammed 30-40 meters into the swamp .
for the various inclines , he built up layers of styrofoam , which helped to keep down the weight on the posts .
" we bought up all the styrofoam on the chinese market for a half a year , " tilke said .
spectacle guaranteed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese fans packed the stands on saturday , a day ahead of the final race the effort that went into the building will almost certainly pay off on sunday .
in the run-up to the final race , the stands were already full with ferrari fans and those who were just curious about watching china 's first grand prix .
tilke 's track is expected to produce a good show when the world 's best racers rev up their engines .
during one of his practice runs , it proved almost too much for michael schumacher , who took a curve too fast and spun out of control - an unheard of mistake for the six-time world champion .
tilke 's course will be " quite a challenge , " he told reporters on saturday .
tilke , who turned his passion into profession , is fond of saying " good track design does not automatically guarantee a spectacular race , but bad design certainly will prevent it . "

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .

kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .

" sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said .

but continuing social stigma still makes it difficult for many of the country 's gay and lesbian immigrants to be open about their sexuality . an unusual advertising campaign is making waves in berlin : posters and billboards of young good-looking men are n't anything new .
but these ads are funded by the lesbian and gay federation of germany with the aim of bringing homosexuality out in the open within berlin 's large turkish population . with over 120,000 turkish immigrants , berlin is home to one of the biggest turkish communities outside of the country .
despite being an important part of the liberal german capital , sexuality is still a difficult issue for the turks in berlin .
the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .
they belong to us .
always . "
kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .

the new poster campaign hopes to change all that by bringing homosexuality out into the open . showing five good-looking young mean wearing baseball caps , sweatshirts and low slung jeans , the bright yellow poster could be a typical advertisement for casual streetwear .
except that the slogan reads : " kai is gay .
murat too .

kai is a typical german name , murat a typical turkish one . bildunterschrift : the campaign poster a flood of calls according to bali saygili , a spokesperson for the gay and lesbian federation of germany , the campaign has caused a flood of calls to the organization 's telephone help lines . " after this awareness campaign , we had many calls from men from turkish backgrounds who want information , " saygili said .
" we even had parents who rang to ask , ' my son just told me he is gay , how do i react ' or ' how can we reconnect with our child ' because the family has had problems dealing with their child 's homosexuality . " twelve thousand posters and 50 billboards are plastered around germany 's capital , from turkish newsagents to police stations .
the campaign is also supported by the turkish association berlin brandenburg .
the organization 's spokesperson , erin ünsal , says that although homosexuality is still kept quiet in the turkish community , there has been some change for the better . " even just a couple of years ago , it could n't be talked about .
it was still a very taboo topic .
but i have the feeling it 's getting better , " ünsal said .
" it 's still not enough of course , but the poster campaign has greatly helped in getting the turkish community to speak out .
naturally there has been criticism , but we have received much more positive reactions . " discrimination continues although it is illegal in europe to discriminate against anyone because of their sexual orientation , prejudice against gays and lesbians still exists in germany . this makes it difficult for many people to come out , especially for those who belong to often conservative immigrant communities . this can have devastating consequences including repressed feelings , living in fear of being shunned and even depression or suicide .
families also suffer because sons or daughters , brothers or sisters may move away rather than admit to being homosexual . sahin knows all about such difficulties . a german citizen with a turkish background , he is also gay .
but his family does n't know about his sexual orientation . " sometimes i find playing this game very difficult , because it 's simply a lie and i do n't know how much longer i can go on before i tell my family that i am homosexual , " sahin said . " but at the moment , my family is very narrow-minded in their attitudes .
in turkey , homosexuality is hushed up , even though it exists .
and my parents come from a very traditional region in turkey , and it 's difficult to tell them that their son is homosexual . " important to be out the campaign organizers believe bringing the topic of homosexuality out into the open in the immigrant community is vital .
not only for the psychological health of gay people , but also for their physical health .
that 's particularly important for sexually transmitted diseases . birol is a gay turkish man , whose family and friends know about his sexuality .
he works with people with hiv / aids .
he has first-hand experience on how silence about homosexuality can cause unsafe sex practices and increase the risk of aids . " a large number of turkish men live a double life , some of them married , and they go out in secret , and live their sexuality in the night , " birol said .
" the connection with aids is a problem .

he is among those celebrating national grandparents ' day on saturday , to highlight the country 's super-grans and super granddads .
albert , from mold , has weight trained since he left school and was a finalist in the mr wales contest .
he is currently mr senior wales for over-55s and weighs the same as he did in 1955 .
he said : " what i do find , in the health business , is that grandparents are more able to cope with doing more things with the children .
grandparents are a second line of defence - you go out into the world , but you always feel that you have someone in the background you can turn to stan stennett " they can play football with them or something like that , because they are fitter .
" people are now realising that exercise along with a sensible diet is the way to go - it 's what i try to instil in all the people i come into contact with . "
mr parry and his wife , elsie , have three grandchildren .
he added : " i did n't do anything sporty with them - my daughter works in a gym - we just sort of spoiled them ! "
the role of older people is becoming more important as the uk 's population slowly ages .
the government even has a campaign - age positive - to highlight the benefits of employing more oldies .
but grans and granddads already have the commonsense to know that they are the best .
last year , a poll commissioned by age concern and woolworths found that welsh grandparents came out on top as advisors to youngsters in the family .
the bbc wales news website spoke to two other granddads to find out what they enjoy about their age and position in the family .
deryck howell believes grandchildren keep you young wales ' oldest businessman , deryck howell , 90 , has three grandchildren aged from seven to 11 .
he said : " it rejuvenates you , children seem to make you young again .
it goes back to when i was a parent rather than a grandparent .
" as the grandchildren grow up , it would be true to say that i seem to get younger .
" grandparents of today know a kind of life which is very different from the kind of life which parents today know .
" there were children born before the war who never knew what a banana was until the 1950s .
" it 's something they can talk about with their grandchildren .
" we had to be quite disciplined and perhaps you can instil a little bit of that discipline in your grandchildren that perhaps parents are not so conscious of . "

the wwf and the iucn-world conservation union are set to ask an international trade watchdog to include the fish on its list of protected species .
the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- will have its biennial meeting in october to review the vulnerability of several species .
conservationists hope the humphead wrasse will receive a protected status .
" this giant coral reef fish could soon be eaten out of existence if governments do n't manage the way it is currently caught and traded , " said clarus chu , of wwf-hong kong .
distinctive fish the uk government and eu member states are also calling for tighter controls .
when they convene for the cites conference in bangkok next month they will suggest the humphead wrasse is included in appendix ii , which would allow stricter fishing regulations .
this giant coral reef fish could soon be eaten out of existence clarus chu , of wwf-hong kong " we believe there is a very strong scientific case to upgrade the humphead wrasse to appendix ii , " uk environment minister elliot morley told bbc news online .
the humphead wrasse , cheilinus undulatus , is a distinctive coral reef fish , which lives in the indo-pacific .
it can grow to a hefty 2m in length .
the species is naturally uncommon and , because individuals live for up to 30 years , it has a low rate of population growth .
its rarity , and the fact that it is a prized delicacy , means the humphead wrasse can retail at around us $ 130 / kg , making it one of the most valuable fish in the live reef fish trade .
cites ' reluctant ' have your say species have come and gone long before humans took over this planet , it 's part of evolution pete , uk send us your comments the humphead wrasse is caught using cyanide , which stuns the fish , before it is shipped to restaurants in hong kong or china , where it waits in tanks to be chosen by hungry diners .
because the adult fish reaches a size too big for most dinner plates , it is usually captured in a juvenile state .
this affects the population 's breeding dynamics , making it less able to recover from a dent in numbers .
" most consumers prefer plate-sized fish , which means the fish in trade are very young , " said clarus chu .
" not only is the species gravely threatened but cyanide is often used to stun and capture the fish , which destroys the coral reef , too . "
although management measures have been introduced in a number of countries , illegal and unregulated harvesting still occurs , causing the iucn to promote the species from the status of vulnerable to endangered .
cites is traditionally reluctant to include fish species on appendix ii , because of the impact on the fishing industry .
but with so many groups fighting the humphead wrasse 's corner , there is good chance it will be granted protection .
" putting fish on appendix ii is controversial with cites , " said mr morley .
" but we believe that in -lsb- the case of the humphead wrasse -rsb- the science is overwhelming . "

rutan was drawn to the back of the moon -lrb- photo : tom king / galaxy -rrb- one might think that a man who dreams of opening up space to the holidaymaking public would have had his imagination fired as a boy by science fiction novels .
but burt rutan , 61 , has only ever read one sci-fi book : carl sagan 's contact .
a child of the mid-50s , his strongest memory was wernher von braun 's collaboration with walt disney .
the german physicist drove most of the us space programme 's achievements until his death in 1977 , and made three popular space films for disney tv between 1955 and 1957 .
the films , showing man in space , on the moon , on mars , and the " unknown " , fascinated the boy rutan .
" the most exciting thing i saw as a child was this vision of von braun going to the back of the moon , " he explains to bbc news online , as he relaxes in his plus-fours and diamond socks in preparation for a round of golf .
" that was the strongest impression of adventure , and i think that was so important because the whole world had that sense of adventure 500 years ago when magellan made it around the world . "
shortcut into space as a child , rutan was also surrounded by a furious debate about possible man-made canals and intelligent life on mars .
but the message behind the von braun-disney films was about selling the idea of space travel to the american public , convincing them of the need for the space race .
we did n't have practical model rockets in the 50s .
the ones we made were very dangerous and the kids that played with them did n't have all their fingers , and sometimes were blind in one eye burt rutan similarly , spaceshipone and the other x-prize contenders are trying to sell the idea that space travel can be prised out of the government 's grip and offered to thousands of ordinary folk .
because of what the " little guys " are trying to do , rutan envisages affordable space tourism in 10 to 15 years .
rutan is no " little guy " , however .
his company , scaled composites , is financed by one of the richest men in the world , microsoft co-founder paul allen .
they share a curiosity about the " unknowns " of space .
allen has injected large sums into seti -lrb- search for extra terrestrial intelligence -rrb- , as well as scaled composites .
but when it comes to space , rutan 's passion focuses on the engineering challenges it presents , not et .
rocket passion as a child , he was fascinated with building planes and rockets .
" we did n't have practical model rockets in the 50s .
" the ones we made were very dangerous and the kids that played with them did n't have all their fingers , and sometimes were blind in one eye . "
and on 21 june 2004 , his ultimate rocket - spaceshipone - proved that there was a future for non-governmental space access .
and it did not poke anyone 's eye out .
so strong is his love of engineering , he was inspired to study the pyramids of ancient egypt .
recently , he was misquoted in a magazine interview : he was said to believe aliens built them .
" i told them that i had spent half an hour alone in the king 's chamber of the great pyramid , " rutan explains .
from his engineering perspective , his conclusions differed from what egyptologists said .
" i just believe that we are yet to learn what technologies they had to assemble these perfectly fitting stones that high up in the king 's chamber of the great pyramid . "
eye on the sky once in awe , rutan is now somewhat critical of the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- .
in the 1970s , the capability of affordable space flight had been proved , he insists .
but rutan believes the space agency should have worked the capability harder into a programme in the early 70s , instead of concentrating on beating the russians to the moon .
spaceshipone entered the record books in june in 1961 , there were four manned spaceflights in a year , but the race to the moon took over .
" by 1973 , we had a space station , the skylab , and we had multiple probes going up to planets .
so , all this wonderful stuff happened in 10 to 15 years .
" about that time , there should have been enormous initiatives to make it affordable for people to fly in space , not just a handful of trained nasa astronauts and russian cosmonauts .
" if you asked nasa in those days how long will it be until it is affordable so that i can fly , the answer would be , ' we 're working on it and it 30 years there will be affordability ' . "
' black sky ' he decided instead to dedicate his skills to airplanes .
besides , he was safe in the hope that by the time he was 60 , he would be able to buy his ticket to space .
" all of us wanted to fly in space , " says rutan .
" when we saw what these astronauts said when they came back from these flights , it just amazed everyone . "
the x-prize should open the door to space tourism but , he says , ask the same question of nasa now and the answer is the same as 30 years ago .
nasa is working on it and it will be affordable in 30 years ' time .
" if it is 30 years , i will 90 and will a guy who is 90 get to fly ? "
to rutan , the two choices became apparent .
" the first choice was to give up , and admit that i would never go into space , never see that black sky .
the other choice i had was to do something about it . "
which is what he did , in secret , in the quiet of the mojave desert .
the result , four years later , was the first private manned spaceship .
" once thousands are flying into space , they 'll look back and ask , ' why did this happen ? '
" and what i believe they will conclude is because somebody had the courage to just go out and just see if the little guy with his eye on affordability could actually do this . "
as for et ?
rutan hopes there is local life on other planets , because it would be fun to do what holidaymakers do : " interface them " .

but the attraction closed on 21 december and , apart from a short spell three days later , never opened its doors to skaters again .
the exact cost of the ice rink came to £ 67,709.50 aria direct officially ceased trading on 24 december with losses of £ 120,000 up to march 2002 .
an inquiry launched in january was carried out in secret .
the city council 's legal team said because it was owed money , it needed to keep commercial information out of the public domain .
the inquiry report says action taken by council officers meant some of the lost money was recouped .

save our boxes was unveiled by council leader michael davey to urge bt to scrap plans to remove more than 100 boxes in northumberland .
fire chiefs have warned that fewer boxes could hamper the ability to ring 999 in a fire or accident .
the council claims it will also hit the poor and elderly who can not afford mobile phones or landlines .
remote roads the council said 144 phones in and around blyth , wansbeck , alnwick , berwick , tynedale and morpeth .
residents are being urged to sign an online petition , write to bt or set up their own petition .
bt had set a 22 september deadline for objections , but last week it said it would look more closely at many of the boxes under review following protests .
mr davey said : " we 've heard horror stories of people being quoted thousands for a rural line and this will hit some of the most vulnerable residents .
" landlines are a safety net for people to alert fire , ambulance or police and removing them will give no comfort to walkers , drivers or residents .
mobile phone signals are hit or miss in remote parts of the county .
" roads in parts of the cheviots are remote and harsh in the winter - a callbox may mean life or death to a motorist who breaks down , or it may mean a child not being able to call their parents . "

the 68-year-old 's star 's voice was ruined by a routine operation on her throat in 1997 .
but even though she has a singing role in princess diaries 2 , the actress says she was " sing-speaking " for the part .
" i 'm not really going to be singing again , i do n't think , sadly , " she told michael parkinson 's itv1 chat show .
dame julie had been hoping a pioneering operation to implant new vocal cords , currently being tested on cancer patients , would help restore her voice .
but she told parkinson - in an interview screened on saturday - that by the time the technique is perfected , it will be too late for her .
" i do n't think i 'll be around by then , " she said .
" there 's all kinds of talk , but if you think about it i have a piece of cord missing and so can you imagine putting into a vocal cord exactly what vibrates correctly , what is smooth .
" i 'd do it like a shot if it was ready , but it 's not going to be ready for a very long time . "
of her singing role in princess diaries 2 , she said : " i try the smallest , smallest amount of a song , but i kind of sing as much as rex harrison used to do -lsb- in my fair lady -rsb- .
" i do n't want people to think i 'm making a big comeback or anything like that . "
however , she said was trying to keep a positive outlook on life .

however , the newry and armagh mla said he was concerned about proposals to close the station in middletown .
" in terms of its strategic importance and its location right on the border , and given the very serious threat still posed by republican dissidents in the area , i think it is premature at this stage to close middletown station , " he said .
armagh district command unit is examining the viability of the station , which is staffed by officers on a part-time basis .
proposals the police said in a statement earlier this week that an average of two people called each month into the station , which costs about £ 100,000 to run each year .
extensive building work is needed , and the police believe the estimated costs involved are not " a prudent use of public funds " .
under new proposals , officers based in keady would serve the middletown area between 8am and midnight , with overnight cover provided by police in armagh .
the psni has begun a consultation process on the future of middletown 's station which runs until 22 october .

between 10 and 23 september , reporters richard greene and kevin anderson visited five states to try to shed light on the issues that make the headlines - and some that do n't .
they sent back a series of regular in-depth reports telling us what they found .
kevin also tracked the ups and downs of their journey in a blog .
click on the map above to see in detail where our reporters went , and scroll down the page to read more about them and their personal thoughts about of the trip .
richard greene i was born and raised in the united states - just down the road from kevin , in fact , by american standards - but it 's been 13 years since i last lived there .
self-portrait in 10 words or less : long-time american expat , new father , diehard chicago cubs baseball fan on the road , i 'll be reading : the boys of summer by roger kahn - a book about the legendary brooklyn dodgers , the first baseball team to break the colour barrier by hiring a black player .
and all the local papers i can get my hands on i 'll miss most : my baby daughter and her mother those have been momentous years , long enough for the world to change not just once but at least twice .
a cold war has ended and a war on terror has begun .
the economy has busted and boomed and busted again .
a president george bush has left the white house and a president george bush has entered it .
but in this ever-changing world , have americans themselves changed ?
this year 's neck-and-neck election provides a welcome opportunity to hit the road and get back in touch with america and americans .
in this increasingly uncertain world , what frightens them ?
and in this ever-optimistic country , what inspires them ?
i know what the politicians , the papers and the polls say , but that 's not always the same as what the people say .
kevin anderson as bob dylan once wrote , the country i come from is called the midwest , 90 miles west of chicago .
self-portrait in 10 words or less : soccer-playing , high-mountain backpacking , well-adjusted geek -lrb- mostly -rrb- on the road , i 'll be reading : better than sex , confessions of a political junkie by hunter s thompson .
as the amazon review says , thompson offers his own " mind-bending view of the 1992 presidential campaign , in all its horror , sacrifice , lust , and dubious glory " .
i 'll miss most : if i do n't say my girlfriend , i wo n't have a place to sleep when i get back it 's out beyond the sprawling suburbs and closer to wisconsin dairy country than the windy city .
it 's farmland , with gently rolling hills and field after field of corn .
i do n't know if it is that mythical place people call middle america , that place where the purest proto-american lives .
but i do touch base with my parents often to see what they 're thinking because they 're part of that radical middle - politically not geographically - that i tend to think make up the great majority of the american electorate .
i have been to 49 of the 50 states in the us .
hawaii is still on my to-do list , and if there is one thing that i have learned is that it is risky to generalise about americans .
i 'm sure that from the outside we must look a lot alike , especially if your main exposure to us is movies and reruns of friends .
but it 's a big country with a lot of different ideas .
i 've spent six years in washington , and the us can start to look a lot less interesting than it really is from there .
polls make the country out to be warring camps of god-on-our-side conservatives and latte-drinking , volvo-driving liberals .
reality is always more interesting than that .

hawaii is still on my to-do list , and if there is one thing that i have learned is that it is risky to generalise about americans .
i 'm sure that from the outside we must look a lot alike , especially if your main exposure to us is movies and reruns of friends .
but it 's a big country with a lot of different ideas .
i 've spent six years in washington , and the us can start to look a lot less interesting than it really is from there .
polls make the country out to be warring camps of god-on-our-side conservatives and latte-drinking , volvo-driving liberals .
reality is always more interesting than that .

it has n't happened yet , but you never know ...
adam price , the brilliant young nationalist mp who successfully led the campaign to impeach tony blair , is the new leader of plaid cymru .
he will take his seat in the new welsh parliament alongside two of plaid 's former mps , simon thomas and elfyn llwyd .
they will be joined by another former party leader , dafydd wigley , who makes his political comeback after winning the conwy seat .
his re-emergence in frontline politics follows a bitter internal feud with the former presiding officer lord elis thomas over what constitutes nationalism !
lord elis thomas , another former party leader , decided to abandon his plans to stand again for the assembly and announced that he intended to spend more time with his family in the house of lords . "
you begin to understand why the thinkers in the party are thinking the unthinkable " mr price , the new party leader , in an audacious move to deny labour continuing control of the assembly , is expected to announce an unholy alliance with the conservative group in cardiff bay .
the plaid cymru / tory pact will end more than a decade of labour dominance of the assembly .
key posts will be shared between the two parties when mr price announces his cabinet later this week .
already it 's becoming clear that the cerebral conservative am , david melding , will be one of the big winners , taking over the health portfolio held in three successive administrations by jane hutt .
it 's almost certain that elfyn llwyd , the party 's former leader in the commons , will become wales ' new home secretary .
simon thomas will be charged with the unenviable task of reforming the barnett formula .
another winner will be glyn davies .
his first ask will be to drive through a new welsh language act .
mr davies has already said that if he 's given the brief he will appoint another former leader of plaid cymru , the recently retired member for ynys môn , to help him draft the legislation .
helen mary jones is expected to become sports minister following her considerable success in challenging rhodri morgan 's plans to spend the entire departmental budget on the ryder cup .
the coalition pact will mean the temporary suspension of plaid 's commitment to independence and the conservatives unconditional loyalty to the union .
mr price said : " today is a very good day in wales .
our country has a parliament and a stable government committed to providing our people with sustainable environmental policies ; affordable housing and a health service free from creeping privatisation . "
" i ask you all to support us in our ambitions as we work together for a fairer society . "
ah , you 're still there ! "
it 's little wonder that the party is reaching for the stars and , in the firmament , they 've found one - adam price " no doubt by now you 're wondering about the sanity of the writer .
sounds too fanciful to be credible does n't it ?
but , believe it or not , the scenario outlined above - or something close to it - is already fermenting in the minds of those who ferment such things .
it may even have occurred to some of those who wound their way to llandudno at the weekend for the plaid cymru conference , whose main theme was trust .
the party gathered at the seaside after what its chair , john dixon , described as a " mixed year " electorally .
the party retained one seat in the european elections , but slipped to third place behind the tories .
at the local elections it lost 28 seats and two symbolically important valley councils .
add to this the indifferent performance of the party in the assembly and , at times , the almost invisible presence of the group leader , ieuan wyn jones , and you begin to understand why the thinkers in the party are thinking the unthinkable .
in the gloom generated by the combination of events outlined above , it 's little wonder that the party is reaching for the stars and , in the firmament , they 've found one - adam price .
he sits at the apex of a triangle of ambitions which the party hopes to roll out in llandudno .
before the conference began , much talk was expected of creating sustainable communities , green industries , affordable housing and the draining influence of outward migration .
the focus , though , was on preparing for next year 's general election and ensuring that the party consolidates its four parliamentary seats .
that achieved , plaid can then concentrate on the real challenge - the assembly elections in 2007 .
if it is to move towards anything like the dream scenario outlined at the outset , it must first of all get real and convince the electorate it is a credible alternative to labour .
much is hanging on the success of adam price - the man tipped as the next leader but one .
but he and his party know there 's a great deal to do before be becomes first minister .
in the meantime there 's no harm in a little bit of blue skies thinking .
as long as plaid cymru remembers that in wales things cloud over very quickly !
