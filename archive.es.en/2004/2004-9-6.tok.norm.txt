the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "

at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

on monday , heidi klum 's legs got the recognition they deserve when insurers valued them at € 1.6 million . as one of the world ’ s most in-demand and recognizable supermodels , heidi klum is accustomed to having millions mentioned in the same breath as her name .
for example , the german victoria ’ s secrets icon is said to make an estimated € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- a year through advertising endorsements alone .
but in an unusual step , the seven figure number released along with klum ’ s moniker on monday had nothing to do with what she earns - but what she ’ s worth .
to be precise , what her legs are estimated to be worth in terms of insurance .
klum has recently signed a contract with german electronics manufacturer braun to promote the company ’ s new hair-removal product and as the stars of the campaign , company execs consulted an expert just how much heidi ’ s perfect pins would be worth .
expensive legs come as a pair john souglides , a jewelry specialist from auction house phillips de pury & company , was asked by braun bosses to assess klum ’ s legs ahead of a possible insurance policy which would cover them for the duration of their ad campaign .
souglides , more used to running his careful eye over inanimate objects , studied heidi ’ s willowy limbs on their length , shape , rarity and commercial value .
the result being a price tag of some € 1.6 million , although it was unclear whether this value was for the pair of if they were worth € 800,000 each .
" having valued static objects for 15 years , it makes a refreshing change to be asked to value something living , and i certainly admired the exquisite lines of this piece , " purred souglides after assessing the 31-year-old model ’ s legs .
valuation firm intrigued by offer souglides , who used the principles of jewelry valuation to come to the price tag , added : " phillips de pury has been in the valuation business since 1796 and , although we have valued some unusual and unique pieces in that time , this is the first time we have ever been asked to value a body part and we were intrigued by the challenge braun set us .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "

“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .

however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul .

high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .

the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .

deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "
high profile clash a fitting comeback as well as recovering from three knee operations , the 24 year-old has only recently returned after severe depression kept him out of club football for much of last season .
he has not played for the national team since september 2003 but he has been in good form this year and sees the high profile clash against the world champions in berlin as a perfect comeback match .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .
deisler could face wrath of bayern coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler there could be similar club versus country ructions in germany ahead of the brazil friendly as bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler looks set to ignore his club coach and return to international soccer in the game in berlin .
deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "
high profile clash a fitting comeback as well as recovering from three knee operations , the 24 year-old has only recently returned after severe depression kept him out of club football for much of last season .
he has not played for the national team since september 2003 but he has been in good form this year and sees the high profile clash against the world champions in berlin as a perfect comeback match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann .
german coach jürgen klinsmann is an admirer of deisler and has made no secret of the fact that he sees the creative midfielder as a key player in his attempts to rebuild the national side before germany hosts the world cup in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann era opens with victory german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "

the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .

on monday , heidi klum 's legs got the recognition they deserve when insurers valued them at € 1.6 million . as one of the world ’ s most in-demand and recognizable supermodels , heidi klum is accustomed to having millions mentioned in the same breath as her name .
for example , the german victoria ’ s secrets icon is said to make an estimated € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- a year through advertising endorsements alone .
but in an unusual step , the seven figure number released along with klum ’ s moniker on monday had nothing to do with what she earns - but what she ’ s worth .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .
elsewhere in the capital , news filtered through of a massive anti-terror demonstration planned for tuesday outside the kremlin by russia ’ s main trade with as many as 100,000 people expected to attend . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in beslan took place on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2004 schröder 's spd trounced in saarland vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's cdu state premier peter müller swept to victory in the polls germany 's social democrats suffered their worst defeat in over 40 years in the state elections in saarland on sunday , as voters vented their anger over chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reforms . the poor showing for schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in saarland continued a string of defeats in recent state elections .
the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul .

" if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .

europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .

" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .

on monday , heidi klum 's legs got the recognition they deserve when insurers valued them at € 1.6 million . as one of the world ’ s most in-demand and recognizable supermodels , heidi klum is accustomed to having millions mentioned in the same breath as her name .

" having valued static objects for 15 years , it makes a refreshing change to be asked to value something living , and i certainly admired the exquisite lines of this piece , " purred souglides after assessing the 31-year-old model ’ s legs .
valuation firm intrigued by offer souglides , who used the principles of jewelry valuation to come to the price tag , added : " phillips de pury has been in the valuation business since 1796 and , although we have valued some unusual and unique pieces in that time , this is the first time we have ever been asked to value a body part and we were intrigued by the challenge braun set us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2004 russia mourns beslan tragedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of beslan face another day of burying their dead coffins large and small continue to be carried to their final resting places in beslan as the grief emanating from the small caucasian town spreads across russia , prompting fear and anger and raising difficult questions . dozens of coffins snaked their way through this grief-stricken town into a muddy field serving as a makeshift cemetery on monday as russia buried its children on a day of mourning for the hundreds who died in the beslan school crisis .
drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .
elsewhere in the capital , news filtered through of a massive anti-terror demonstration planned for tuesday outside the kremlin by russia ’ s main trade with as many as 100,000 people expected to attend . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in beslan took place on sunday .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .
elsewhere in the capital , news filtered through of a massive anti-terror demonstration planned for tuesday outside the kremlin by russia ’ s main trade with as many as 100,000 people expected to attend . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in beslan took place on sunday .
more than 200 people remain missing .
-lrb- september 5 , 2004 -rrb- death toll above 320 in russian school attack while estimates of the number of people killed in the hostage-taking drama in a russian school rose ever higher on saturday , many questions remained unanswered the day after a siege put an end to the crisis .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .

real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .

that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .
deisler could face wrath of bayern coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler there could be similar club versus country ructions in germany ahead of the brazil friendly as bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler looks set to ignore his club coach and return to international soccer in the game in berlin .
deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "

“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .
deisler could face wrath of bayern coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler there could be similar club versus country ructions in germany ahead of the brazil friendly as bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler looks set to ignore his club coach and return to international soccer in the game in berlin .
deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "
high profile clash a fitting comeback as well as recovering from three knee operations , the 24 year-old has only recently returned after severe depression kept him out of club football for much of last season .
he has not played for the national team since september 2003 but he has been in good form this year and sees the high profile clash against the world champions in berlin as a perfect comeback match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .

more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .
again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .
the swedish and dutch leaders added their two cents to the session on friday .
-lrb- september 4 , 2004 -rrb- a new east-west divide in germany ?
more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .
again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul .

" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision . " there is no question of us saying : ' we 've reached our station , let 's get out , " he said at monday 's press conference . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .
elsewhere in the capital , news filtered through of a massive anti-terror demonstration planned for tuesday outside the kremlin by russia ’ s main trade with as many as 100,000 people expected to attend . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in beslan took place on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "

that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .

falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .

saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .

an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2004 schröder 's spd trounced in saarland vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's cdu state premier peter müller swept to victory in the polls germany 's social democrats suffered their worst defeat in over 40 years in the state elections in saarland on sunday , as voters vented their anger over chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reforms . the poor showing for schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in saarland continued a string of defeats in recent state elections .
the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "

in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2004 russia mourns beslan tragedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of beslan face another day of burying their dead coffins large and small continue to be carried to their final resting places in beslan as the grief emanating from the small caucasian town spreads across russia , prompting fear and anger and raising difficult questions . dozens of coffins snaked their way through this grief-stricken town into a muddy field serving as a makeshift cemetery on monday as russia buried its children on a day of mourning for the hundreds who died in the beslan school crisis .
drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .
elsewhere in the capital , news filtered through of a massive anti-terror demonstration planned for tuesday outside the kremlin by russia ’ s main trade with as many as 100,000 people expected to attend . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de funerals begin after russian hostage tragedy the first funerals since the bloody end of the school hostage crisis two days ago in beslan took place on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened .

an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .

european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "

" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision . " there is no question of us saying : ' we 've reached our station , let 's get out , " he said at monday 's press conference . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2004 schröder 's spd trounced in saarland vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's cdu state premier peter müller swept to victory in the polls germany 's social democrats suffered their worst defeat in over 40 years in the state elections in saarland on sunday , as voters vented their anger over chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reforms . the poor showing for schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in saarland continued a string of defeats in recent state elections .
the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .
the swedish and dutch leaders added their two cents to the session on friday .
-lrb- september 4 , 2004 -rrb- a new east-west divide in germany ?
more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .
again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision . " there is no question of us saying : ' we 've reached our station , let 's get out , " he said at monday 's press conference . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . -lrb- february 24 , 2004 -rrb- eu doubles aid to turkey - with strings attached the european union says it will double pre-accession aid to turkey , but warns that any turkish invasion into iraq would jeopardize its future eu candidacy . -lrb- march 27 , 2003 -rrb- new turkish prime minister pledges sweeping reforms abdullah gul , a staunch advocate of turkey ’ s bid for eu membership , close u.s . ties and a favorite of financial markets was appointed turkey ’ s prime minister , ending days of speculation . -lrb- november 16 , 2002 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .

he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.09.2004 russia mourns beslan tragedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people of beslan face another day of burying their dead coffins large and small continue to be carried to their final resting places in beslan as the grief emanating from the small caucasian town spreads across russia , prompting fear and anger and raising difficult questions . dozens of coffins snaked their way through this grief-stricken town into a muddy field serving as a makeshift cemetery on monday as russia buried its children on a day of mourning for the hundreds who died in the beslan school crisis .
drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .
guards stood at the entrance of several moscow schools .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .

however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .

saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .

during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.09.2004 warsaw-berlin tensions rise over expellee claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were forced to flee poland en masse after world war ii moves by berlin to recover money paid to ethnic germans who lost property in poland at the end of world war two , along with lawsuits threatened by expellee groups , threaten to hurt ties with warsaw . in recent months , german authorities have encouraged immigrants from poland of german ancestry to sue for property they lost when they were forced to leave the country after world war ii .
the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .

he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2004 -pipe- 18:00 utc german industrial orders gain 3 percent increased foreign demand led to an unexpected 3 percent increase in orders for german products from june to july , the german ministry of economics announced monday .
german industry nearly made up may to june 's 3.3 percent order slump .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .

after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .

the controversial advice has put berlin on a political crash course with warsaw .
the move by the federal office for the sharing of burdens has also caused problems for some of the polish immigrants living here in germany .
when they emigrated to the west or were forced to flee , then communist poland often expropriated any property they left behind .
the german government in turn provided them with partial compensation for their losses to help them get a fresh start .
since 1949 , the government has dispursed a total of € 74 billion in " burden sharing " payments .
agency encourages suits but now that poland has been a democratic country for more than a decade , the same authority is now reviewing old claims and in some cases is claiming that property legally belongs to the former owners , even if it is under the control of polish authorities .
in those cases , the agency is urging former claims recipients to sue in poland to regain their property .
over the weekend , the german newsweekly der spiegel profiled the travails of an ethnic german family that emigrated from poland in 1978 .
the family of hans and eva ludwig , who left gleiwitz , poland , once received payments from the agency .
now , a little more than two decades later , the office for the sharing of burdens is demanding that its money be returned .
the move has forced the ludwigs to sue the poles .
" the burden sharing office has given us no other chance , " daughter cornelia galla told the magazine .
the ludwig family 's property in poland is currently claimed by a cooperative .
günter gallenkamp , who works for the federal agency , told der spiegel he estimated that in recent years it has sent 500 such notices to polish immigrants living in germany .
" i also assume that number is going to increase to the thousands in the near future , " he said .
in many cases gallenkamp said , families have already paid back the money - an indication to the office that many do , in fact , have access to their old property .
the ludwig family has paid € 4,658 back to the german government , but it has also hired a lawyer in poland and plans to sue to get the house back .
a thorn in warsaw 's side these low-level lawsuits come at the same time a controversial lobby group is planning to launch its own suits in polish and international courts .
the president of the prussian claims society , rudi pawelka , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on saturday that his organization planned to file about 15 lawsuits relating to settlement claims in both polish and international courts in the coming weeks .
the string of developments has angered the polish government , which fears a deluge of suits from the thousands of other ethnic german expellees .
in total , 3.5 million ethnic germans were forced to leave poland in the decades following the war .
" the activities of the prussian claims society are creating huge damage to polish-german relations , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told der spiegel .
berlin shuns claims demands despite efforts by the german government to distance itself from such activities , the moves have deepened tensions in a country where germany still has n't been forgiven by many poles for crimes committed during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder visits teh 60th anniversary memorial ceremony of the warsaw uprising .
after poles attacked the nazis , the german troops fought back , killing close to 200,000 , mostly civilians .
during his visit to poland on the 60th anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis , german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected the legitimacy of the suits outright .
" we germans know very well who started the war and who were its first victims .
that 's why there must be no more room today for restitution claims from germany , " he said .
schröder added that germany would oppose any move by lobbying groups to take the issue to the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in poland , few will be happy as long as expellee lobbyists continue their work .
" there 's still a deep feeling in poland that the country suffered a great injustice , " poland 's cimoszewicz said .
" we are talking about millions of victims , about the destruction of our country , about the theft of a large part of our material cultural inheritance . "
when groups like the prussian claims society threaten the poles with lawsuits , he said , " then suddenly you start to hear demands in poland that the sum of the polish war damage should be assessed and a bill sent to germany . "
such sentiment has n't stopped groups like the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- and the prussian claims society from pushing for settlements .
at an annual meeting of bdv members over the weekend , the organization 's president , erika steinbach , accused berlin of operating on a double standard .
on the one hand , she noted , schröder is telling the poles the german government will not support any future claims demands .
but on the other , the finance ministry is demanding repayment from many claims recipients , effectively forcing them to sue in polish courts . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german post-war refugees to claim polish assets germans driven out of poland at the end of world war ii said tuesday they would file a lawsuit this year to reclaim their assets , aggravating an already bitter debate between the wartime foes .

" in a situation when the whole world knew that the main priority was saving children , and that there would be no storming , to hear such words from a minister seems to us to be blasphemy , " sergey lavrov , the russian foreign minister , told the guardian newspaper .

the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .

real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .

that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .

a report by the foreign policy center - a pro-european think tank - warned that blair 's credibility , which was severely damaged by the decision to go to war in iraq , is not strong enough to swing voters across to the " yes " side .
the campaign should be led instead by finance minister gordon brown , along with external relations commissioner chris patten and pro-european liberal democrat leader charles kennedy , the fpc said .
the think tank unveiled new polling data showing that 65 percent are undecided how they will vote in a referendum on the european constitution .
however , the " no " campaign are well ahead at present , with 50 percent of those already decided saying they would vote no in a popular vote , compared to 31 percent saying yes .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .
deisler could face wrath of bayern coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler there could be similar club versus country ructions in germany ahead of the brazil friendly as bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler looks set to ignore his club coach and return to international soccer in the game in berlin .
deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "
high profile clash a fitting comeback as well as recovering from three knee operations , the 24 year-old has only recently returned after severe depression kept him out of club football for much of last season .
he has not played for the national team since september 2003 but he has been in good form this year and sees the high profile clash against the world champions in berlin as a perfect comeback match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .

german industry nearly made up may to june 's 3.3 percent order slump .
domestic growth only accounted for 1 percent while foreign orders jumped 5.2 percent .
the results are a 7.7 percent increase over the same period last year .
while calling the increases a positive sign , many analysts expect the order index , which can be an early indicator of future economic health , to drop in the second half of the year due to falling exports and a weak german consumer demand . more briefs 06.09.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut 1,500 jobs 04.09.2004 -pipe- toll collect holds hopes for new start date 03.09.2004 -pipe- frankfurt banks in huge corruption scandal 03.09.2004 -pipe- corporate failures stabilising in germany 02.09.2004 -pipe- european central break upbeat for future 02.09.2004 -pipe- one-euro jobs appeal to unemployed 02.09.2004 -pipe- soon direct flights from berlin to us ? 01.09.2004 -pipe- retails sales in germany unexpectedly rise radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .
the prestigious match carries little importance to the home side other than it represents a chance to exact revenge on the samba stars who ruined their improbable world cup dream two years ago by beating them 2-0 in yokohama in the 2002 final . germany as hosts for the 2006 world cup are automatically installed in the tournament while recent rule changes dictate that reigning world champions brazil have to qualify for the right to defend their crown .
brazil will be arriving in germany after completing the south american world cup qualifier against bolivia in sao paulo .
despite the practice match scenario , ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. can expect to face stiff opposition in jürgen klinsmann 's side with a full-strength germany team expected to take the field as the home nation continues its own preparation for the 2006 world cup . leverkusen stars among those punished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio will miss the germany game along with team-mate at bayern munich ze roberto .
however , some of brazil 's most exciting and established players will not be on view .
the five players who did not play in brazil 's friendly international in haiti on the august 18 will miss both the bolivia and germany games .
ac milan players cafu , kaka and dida , along with bayer leverkusen 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- and ze roberto have been punished by the brazilian football federation -lrb- cbf -rrb- for not appearing in brazil 's 6-0 victory at port-au-prince .
the stars were absent after not being released by their clubs for the haiti game .
real madrid star ronaldo supported the decision saying that the cbf wanted to preserve the honor of those who wear brazil 's green and yellow colors .
however , ronaldo 's team mate in the spanish capital , fellow galactico roberto carlos , was not of the same opinion , saying : " the federations and the clubs have to work together . "
the left back added the five excluded players would have loved to be playing for brazil .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did not comment directly on the cbf 's decision but did say it complicated things as ronaldinho gaucho , juan and gustavo nery were all out injured .
deisler could face wrath of bayern coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sebastian deisler there could be similar club versus country ructions in germany ahead of the brazil friendly as bayern munich midfielder sebastian deisler looks set to ignore his club coach and return to international soccer in the game in berlin .
deisler , who missed almost the entire season last term through injury and depression , went public on his desire to return for germany against brazil on 8th september , setting himself on collision course with bayern boss felix magath . " basically , i would really like to play against brazil .
that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "
magath believes his player should not rush things : " before he returns to the national team , deisler should first stabilize his performances for the club .
he 's on the right path , but someone that had problems that long should be built up carefully . "
high profile clash a fitting comeback as well as recovering from three knee operations , the 24 year-old has only recently returned after severe depression kept him out of club football for much of last season .
he has not played for the national team since september 2003 but he has been in good form this year and sees the high profile clash against the world champions in berlin as a perfect comeback match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann .
german coach jürgen klinsmann is an admirer of deisler and has made no secret of the fact that he sees the creative midfielder as a key player in his attempts to rebuild the national side before germany hosts the world cup in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann era opens with victory german fans breathed a sigh of relief as jürgen klinsmann 's team bore the fruits of moderate success .

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .

saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .

the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .

the eu decision will be based on a report due to be published by the european commission in october , which will assess turkey 's progress towards meeting the union 's political norms and make a recommendation on whether to open membership negotiations .
as he began a five-day visit to the country , verheugen promised monday that the commission would provide an objective analysis of turkey 's reform drive to haul itself up to european standards . " i can promise you that -lrb- the report -rrb- will be fair and objective and honest and that it will take into account the impressive progress that was made in turkey , " verheugen told reporters after meeting turkish foreign minister abdullah gul . " we agree that now the moment of truth is coming , " he added .
" i made it very clear : nothing can and must postpone the decision foreseen for december . "
high stakes the enlargement commissioner is no stranger to turkey .
over the years he has regularly visited the country as part of the process of assessing its bid to join the european union . this time , the stakes could not be higher , and verheugen has admitted the commission is still divided over whether or not turkey is ready . the turkish government has been quick to point out the sweeping reforms it has introduced to meet eu standards .
but according to political commentator mehmet ali birand , ankara now feels that further progress is dependent on the eu giving a date for admission talks . " if the european union genuinely wishes to push turkey for those reforms on human rights and democracy , they should give a hand and be a little bit more forthcoming , giving a date to start full membership negotiations , " he said .
implementation : still cause for concern but the eu remains concerned that these reforms have yet to be effectively implemented . verheugen is therefore spending most of his trip travelling around the country meeting the turkish people . his first destination is diyarbakir , the provincial capital of the predominantly kurdish south east of turkey , where he will meet local leaders and non-governmental organizations , in particular human rights groups . turkey 's treatment of its kurdish population has been one of the main factors holding back its accession bid , while women 's rights are another sticking point . amnesty international earlier this year published a damming report on the treatment of women , saying up to 50 % suffer domestic violence .
it also said that honor killings of women continue to occur .
one of the authors of the report is christine curry . " i am pleased to say pretty much all the reforms proposed by the women 's groups and amnesty have been accepted in the draft legislation , currently before parliament but i think a lot of work has to be done , it is very serous problem , " she says .
" implementation remains a concern . " gul insists that turkey will continue to carry out its democratic reforms regardless of the eu decision . " there is no question of us saying : ' we 've reached our station , let 's get out , " he said at monday 's press conference . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .

drizzle fell as soldiers dug and tractors plowed into the soggy ground to make room for 160 new graves .
thousands watched on - some women falling into hysterics and fainting , soldiers breaking out into tears - as the coffins were lowered into the earth .
" god !
why did you take him so early ?
why ? " one woman wailed over the grave of her son .
with the republic on the edge of its nerves , landmine experts from the russian army checked the field on the edge of an airport before the ceremony got underway .
meanwhile charred remains of books , uniforms , shoes , schoolbags - anything recovered from the smoldering ashes of school no. 1 from their lost kids - were laid out by parents amid the carnations in the school 's shattered shell .
the latest death toll had increased to as many as 335 - half of them believed to have been children .
some 337 remained hospitalized , many of them in serious condition with burns and shrapnel wounds .
" today , with our hearts and souls , we are all there .
we are in north ossetia , in beslan , " russian president vladimir putin told a government meeting in moscow before standing up to observe a moment of silence .
europe offers explanation for comments in brussels , members of the european union executive held a minute 's silence for the victims of the hostage-taking as the european commission moved to defuse the row over a statement made on friday by dutch foreign minister bernard bot , who said the eu wanted to " know from the russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened . "
an official eu statement on monday spoke of the regret over the " misunderstanding " which had led to a sharp rebuke from moscow , adding that it was a shame that the row was clouding the issue at a time when europe wants to express its solidarity with russia .
" there are things that have been taken out of context for reasons that i do n't know , " said spokesman reijo kemppinen , who reiterated brussels ' condemnation of the beslan hostage-taking as an " evil , despicable act of barbarism . "
european commission chief romano prodi said on sunday that it was legitimate to make a " friendly " request to russia for an explanation , albeit only after further examination of what exactly happened including any " gray areas . "
" following that process a request for an explanation is legitimate , as is normal between friendly countries , " he added on the margins of a meeting in northern italy .
the commission later underlined that the eu remarks did not imply any criticism of russian authorities .
schröder calls for help not advice in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder offered his own support .
he called for help and solidarity with the victims instead of advice .
" we have always made clear that there must be a political solution in chechnya , but in order to reach a political solution one needs people to talk to .
i do not believe that we can or should negotiate with terrorists who shoot panicked children in the back . "
meanwhile , russian television pulled its entertainment programs and recriminations rang out in the moscow press over why no one was being held responsible for a three-day standoff near chechnya that ended in carnage not seen in the modern russian era .
russia 's leaders were accused of indecisiveness in a time of crisis , being thrown into panic by a crisis that could have been foretold amid a broader wave of chechen-linked violence sweeping the country .
russian media criticizes indecision " the beslan operation was headed by more or less everyone who was not too lazy to do it - local authorities , regional authorities , the security services , " the authoritative vedomosti newspaper wrote .
" but the law on terrorism says that the fsb -lrb- federal security service , ex-kgb -rrb- should be in charge of anti-terrorism operation , " the paper said , noting that it was not clear if those agents were on the spot .
russian state-controlled television ran footage of a man who looked like he was from the caucasus being dragged by police , his arms handcuffed high behind his back , in pain and being accused of orchestrating the strike .
" this man personally took part in the attack , he was part of that gang , he took part in shooting .
today he will be charged , " sergei fridinsky said in comments broadcast by russia 's channel one television .
" they will all be punished for all the crimes they committed , and this man among others , " fridinsky added .
the suspect , whose name and nationality were not released , insisted in strongly accented russian that " by allah , i have not shot " and " by allah , i have not killed . "
huge anti-terror demonstration planned anger and fear was tangible across the nation .
the education ministry ordered schools across russia to boost security and issued guidelines for doing so .

on monday , heidi klum 's legs got the recognition they deserve when insurers valued them at € 1.6 million . as one of the world ’ s most in-demand and recognizable supermodels , heidi klum is accustomed to having millions mentioned in the same breath as her name .
for example , the german victoria ’ s secrets icon is said to make an estimated € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- a year through advertising endorsements alone .
but in an unusual step , the seven figure number released along with klum ’ s moniker on monday had nothing to do with what she earns - but what she ’ s worth .
to be precise , what her legs are estimated to be worth in terms of insurance .
klum has recently signed a contract with german electronics manufacturer braun to promote the company ’ s new hair-removal product and as the stars of the campaign , company execs consulted an expert just how much heidi ’ s perfect pins would be worth .
expensive legs come as a pair john souglides , a jewelry specialist from auction house phillips de pury & company , was asked by braun bosses to assess klum ’ s legs ahead of a possible insurance policy which would cover them for the duration of their ad campaign .
souglides , more used to running his careful eye over inanimate objects , studied heidi ’ s willowy limbs on their length , shape , rarity and commercial value .
the result being a price tag of some € 1.6 million , although it was unclear whether this value was for the pair of if they were worth € 800,000 each .
" having valued static objects for 15 years , it makes a refreshing change to be asked to value something living , and i certainly admired the exquisite lines of this piece , " purred souglides after assessing the 31-year-old model ’ s legs .
valuation firm intrigued by offer souglides , who used the principles of jewelry valuation to come to the price tag , added : " phillips de pury has been in the valuation business since 1796 and , although we have valued some unusual and unique pieces in that time , this is the first time we have ever been asked to value a body part and we were intrigued by the challenge braun set us .

but a row over players missing from international duty in favor of club commitments could take the shine off the match . world champions brazil take on germany in a friendly game in berlin on wednesday .

that would be a great return , " he said .
" if i 'm to gain practice , every match is important .
if i 'm called , i will drive there . "

the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "

“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .

falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .

saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2004 schröder 's spd trounced in saarland vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's cdu state premier peter müller swept to victory in the polls germany 's social democrats suffered their worst defeat in over 40 years in the state elections in saarland on sunday , as voters vented their anger over chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reforms . the poor showing for schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in saarland continued a string of defeats in recent state elections .
the party has suffered as the government in berlin has pushed its painful labor market reforms and social cuts .
amid low turnout , voters left the spd smarting by slashing the party 's score by one third from 44.4 percent in the last state election in 1999 to a dismal 30.8 percent , according to provisional results .
it was the worst result for the spd in saarland since 1960 .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took advantage of weeks of protests that had seen tens of thousands of people rally against schröder 's labor market reforms to be returned to power with 47.5 percent . the cdu score was only two percentage points better than they tallied five years ago but will result in an absolute majority of 27 seats in the 51-seat state assembly .
" our goal was to achieve an absolute majority , " cdu state premier peter müller told zdf public television .
" this is a really big day for the cdu , this is a great result . "
spd stronghold a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller said he was more than satisfied that the cdu managed to strengthen its hold on the region while retaining its absolute majority .
“ the saarland used to be an spd stronghold that was impregnable for many years .
that is why not only defending but even enlarging the cdu ’ s absolute majority makes us all very proud and marks a proud day for the party in germany as a whole . ”
spd state leader heiko maas summed up the result as a " clear and bitter defeat " and said that debate surrounding oskar lafontaine , a former schröder ally turned opponent , had contributed to the party 's bad showing .
" oskar lafontaine must decide whether he wants in the future to engage himself inside or the outside the spd , " maas said .
lafontaine , who hails from the former mining region bordering france and luxembourg , is from the spd left and has threatened to join a breakaway party . he has also campaigned with anti-reform protestors in the streets of eastern germany where unemployment in some places is double that in the richer west .
the reform debate has mobilized great resistance in the east and has spread its discontent across the country .
spd stick with reforms despite defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter while accepting that opposition to the reforms would play a leading role in the state elections , the spd remains firm on the policy .
social democrats party manager klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- claims there is no alternative to the reform program .
“ we must keep a steady course with regard to our reform policy .
there are after all strong indications that people are beginning to understand what our intentions are .
so if we remain steadfast now , we will benefit in the end . ”
however , everyone except the spd seemed to be benefiting from the anger against the government 's program . the greens , the junior partner in the federal coalition , also benefited picking up 5.6 percent to return to the state assembly . they will be joined there by the liberal free democrats , who also passed the five percent barrier needed to win seats in parliament with 5.2 percent .
falling short of winning seats was the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , with 4.2 percent of the vote according to exit polls .
turnout for the election was 55.5 percent , down from nearly 69 percent in 1999 . unemployment a factor in protest vote germans usually send warnings to the federal government during elections in the 16 states , and saarland was the site of the first of four polls this month likely to turn protest voices into votes against schröder .
an opinion poll by zdf showed that a huge majority of voters in saarland were concerned about high unemployment .
schröder 's harsh new labor market reforms , to be introduced on january 1 , were also a factor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the federal government made some minor concessions after the so-called monday demonstrations began in earnest , particularly in eastern germany , schröder has refused to cede any more ground . in the east , that stubbornness has translated into new and worrying support for extreme left and right-wing parties . fortunately for schröder , the concrete changes wrought by sunday 's poll will be negligible .
saarland has only three of 69 seats in the bundesrat upper house of parliament , where states are represented based on their populations .
merkel plots further victories but the psychological impact of this hefty defeat could be tremendous , something the opposition is well aware of .
cdu chief angela merkel , who is widely tipped to become schröder ’ s conservative challenger in general elections in 2006 , is already setting her sights on her next ambitious goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel “ this is a signal that our clear course including support for reforms wherever they are needed and courageous action is acknowledged by the electorate , ” merkel said .
“ i believe that in the next elections in saxony we will also be able to defend our absolute majority and that in brandenburg we will catch up with the social democrats there . ”
more elections loom ominously for schröder the eastern states of brandenburg and saxony hold elections on september 19 , where voters are likely to turn against the spd in numbers and toward the former communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- . a week later , north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state and a long-time spd bastion , will hold local elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder determined to weather the storm the german government brought their two-day retreat to a close on saturday after discussing their labor market and social welfare reforms .

on monday , heidi klum 's legs got the recognition they deserve when insurers valued them at € 1.6 million . as one of the world ’ s most in-demand and recognizable supermodels , heidi klum is accustomed to having millions mentioned in the same breath as her name .

the result being a price tag of some € 1.6 million , although it was unclear whether this value was for the pair of if they were worth € 800,000 each .
" having valued static objects for 15 years , it makes a refreshing change to be asked to value something living , and i certainly admired the exquisite lines of this piece , " purred souglides after assessing the 31-year-old model ’ s legs .
valuation firm intrigued by offer souglides , who used the principles of jewelry valuation to come to the price tag , added : " phillips de pury has been in the valuation business since 1796 and , although we have valued some unusual and unique pieces in that time , this is the first time we have ever been asked to value a body part and we were intrigued by the challenge braun set us .

support for the spd fell by one third to 30.8 % .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- retained a majority in the state assembly with 47.5 % .
in the european elections in june , the spd suffered its worst result in decades .
the government 's hated economic reforms have been blamed for the defeat .
these include controversial cuts in social welfare payments .
saarland , with its coalmining past , was an spd stronghold until 1999 .
far-right gains cdu national leader angela merkel - likely to challenge mr schroeder for the chancellorship in 2006 's general elections - described the result as " sensational " .
schroeder has vowed to continue his economic reforms the spd state leader , heiko maas , conceded the result was a " clear and bitter defeat " , but party officials insisted there was no going back on the government 's economic programme .
though the cdu retained its absolute majority in the statehouse , it increased its proportion of the vote by only two percentage points .
smaller parties emerged as the real gainers in the elections .
the far-right national democratic party came from nowhere to take 4.2 % - just a fraction short of the 5 % needed to take parliamentary seats .
the greens and pro-business free democrats both crossed the 5 % hurdle .
turnout dropped substantially in the poll , from 69 % in 1999 to 55.5 % .
resistance to reforms the 800,000 voters appear to have punished the spd for germany 's sluggish economy and chancellor schroeder 's extremely unpopular attempts to reform it , says the bbc 's ray furlong in berlin .
the government 's economic reforms are deeply unpopular tens of thousands of people have marched against cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits over recent weeks .
mr schroeder has already suffered a string of setbacks in local , state and european elections earlier this year .
the spd has now been defeated in six out of the seven state elections held since early 2003 , when mr schroeder embarked on his reforms .
later this month he is also staring defeat in the face in elections in two east german states - brandenburg and saxony - says our correspondent .

icm conducted the nationwide phone poll of 1,010 adults in england , wales and scotland between 20 and 22 august .
the majority of people believed raising the age at which teenagers could buy cigarettes would deter them from taking up the habit .
a slight majority thought the age limit should be raised to 21 .
white paper the bbc 's healthy britain poll questioned people about a range of public health issues .
further data will be revealed later this week .
the survey found the public also backed tough measures to reduce the numbers of children who smoke .
of those questioned , 93 % supported increasing and enforcing the penalties for selling tobacco to children , and two thirds said parents who consistently allow their under-age children to smoke should ultimately face prosecution .
just over half also thought smoking should be made more expensive , and three-quarters said there should be more spent on anti-smoking publicity campaigns .
the government is currently considering whether smoking should be restricted in the workplace , including pubs and clubs .
its decision will be revealed in a public health white paper , due to be published this autumn . "
raising the age is n't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the shop " daniel jones , a 16-year-old smoker in the bbc survey , two thirds of those questioned were in favour of such a ban .
but while 69 % thought government should be trying to change people 's behaviour on smoking - including half of the smokers questioned - 64 % think that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them .
melanie johnson , the public health minister , told the bbc progress had already been made in cutting smoking among young teenagers .
however , she said public feedback to the government 's consultation on public health had not indicated that raising the legal smoking age was a particular priority .
dr vivienne nathanson , of the british medical association , said : " the best way to prevent young people from smoking is to ban smoking in enclosed public places , increase taxation on cigarettes and enforce exisiting age limit legislation .
" what we need to concentrate on is where one person 's " enjoyment " harms others and this means the government showing leadership and following the examples of ireland and norway . "
' still desirable ' a spokesman for the group action on smoking and health said : " we are strongly against young people smoking or buying cigarettes for others . "
the suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21 shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become " simon clark , forest but he said simply raising the legal age for buying cigarettes may not have much effect .
" teenagers are notoriously sharp at getting round such restrictions and they would be hard to enforce .
" more important may be to stop smoking being seen as a desirable and adult thing to do - stop adults smoking and teenagers are much less likely to start .
that 's one reason why we see ending smoking at work as a top priority . "
daniel jones , 16 , started smoking when he was 12 .
he now smokes 20 cigarettes a day .
he did not think raising the age restriction would make any difference .
" raising the age is n't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the shop , " he said .
simon clark , of the smokers ' rights group forest , said , while it supported " reasonable measures that made it more difficult for people under 18 to buy tobacco .
he added : " however , the suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21 shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become .
" the law needs to be consistent .
at present you can have sex at 16 , drive a car at 17 , and drink alcohol in a pub at 18 .
some people would even like to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 .
" there needs to be a clear point at which children are legally declared to be adults and are therefore considered mature enough to make their own decisions about their health and lifestyle . "

" raising the age is n't going to stop people buying cigarettes from the shop , " he said .
simon clark , of the smokers ' rights group forest , said , while it supported " reasonable measures that made it more difficult for people under 18 to buy tobacco .
he added : " however , the suggestion that the age limit be raised to 21 shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become .
" the law needs to be consistent .
at present you can have sex at 16 , drive a car at 17 , and drink alcohol in a pub at 18 .
some people would even like to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 .
" there needs to be a clear point at which children are legally declared to be adults and are therefore considered mature enough to make their own decisions about their health and lifestyle . "

while services to orlando will remain grounded , routes to miami and tampa are expected to re-open .
virgin atlantic said it had managed to run two flights from heathrow to miami on sunday and hoped to do the same on monday to help clear the backlog .
airport closures have left around 6,000 britons stranded in the us .
another 6,000 people have been unable to travel from the uk to florida .
ba had axed 12 flights in three days , with six being cancelled on sunday .
virgin atlantic cancelled 28 flights over the weekend .
british tourists are in the dark as all the tour companies have been really poor at keeping people informed chris payne weblog of britons in florida hurricane frances hammered florida 's east coast on sunday , bringing 100 mph winds and torrential rain .
two people were reportedly killed in the us , taking the death toll to four after the hurricane earlier claimed two lives in the bahamas .
power lines were torn down , leaving millions without electricity , and houses have been damaged and trees uprooted .
british ex-pat george robertson-burnett emigrated to the town of bartow in florida at the beginning of july and is experiencing his second hurricane in three weeks .
' act of god ' on sunday evening he told bbc news online the emergency services were already " swinging into action " and power and telephones being restored .
" trees are still whipping at their tops but the worst is well past , " he said , in an e-mail .
but he later added the calm had given way to heavy gusts of wind and sustained rain .
uk tourist chris payne said information was still not forthcoming on flights home .
uk airline helplines thomas cook : 0870 010 1806 virgin : 08705 747747 british airways : 08708 509850 mytravel airways : 01706 909050 he said there were cars now on the streets despite the curfew still being in place .
" most of the kids in the hotel are going stir crazy after the second day locked inside , " he said .
" nobody seems to know when the airport will re-open and the british tourists who are here are completely in the dark as all the tour companies have been really poor at keeping people informed , " he added .
a ba spokesman said it is expected two return flights to miami from heathrow will run on monday .
but he advised passengers to check the british airways website before leaving for the airport .
a return flight to tampa , which was postponed on sunday , is expected to leave gatwick .
but it is thought that a return flight to orlando from gatwick will remain grounded .
families wade through the floodwaters at west palm beach ba passengers stranded in florida had been told that they could fly to the uk at no extra cost if they could reach another major eastern us airport but the airline has not paid to put people up in accommodation until services resume as the hurricane is " an act of god " and not a fault of ba .
however , many passengers will be able to reclaim expenses on their travel insurance and some were moved on to earlier flights before airports closed .
coronation street star bradley walsh , who was one of those stranded in florida , was said to be making his way to new york in a bid to catch a flight home to enable him to attend a tv awards ceremony on monday night .
on saturday 2.5 million florida residents were told to leave their homes as the second major storm in less than a month approached .
in august , hurricane charley ravaged florida , killing at least 26 people and causing billions of dollars of damage .

but if government ministers were hoping the results would deliver solutions they will be frustrated .
one moment we want the government to ban anything which is bad for us , the next we say we do not think government should interfere in such matters .
for example , how does one reconcile these two findings in a poll commissioned by the bbc ?
almost 70 % of those questioned think the government should try to wean people off the fags .
yet 64 % believe that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them .
it is the same story for alcohol - large majorities think government should encourage us to drink healthily but simultaneously believe how much people drink is up to them and government should butt out .
so what is going on ?
the bbc 's healthy britain survey is one of the most detailed snapshots of public opinion in this area ever taken .
anxiety and distrust " britain is like a well-intentioned but fallible smoker . "
it reveals a nation which is clearly anxious about public health and wants someone to make the problem go away .
but we are also a country that distrusts politicians and values individual freedoms .
we are torn .
" stop me , stop me ! " we say in one breath .
but when the image of that cream cake floats into our mind we balk at the idea of the " health police " coming between us and our waistline .
the phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has tried to give up smoking .
brimming with good intentions , we tell our friends that should they see us about to light up they have permission to snatch up the dreaded fags and crush them before our eyes .
but , of course , our friends would n't remain friends very long if they actually did such a thing .
faced with our failure , we expect sympathy and support .
britain is like that well-intentioned but fallible smoker .
mixed messages our survey shows that most people , -lrb- 55 % -rrb- would like to see the age youngsters can buy tobacco raised from 16 to 21 .
some 80 % think it should be raised to 18 .
we want government to get tougher with those who sell tobacco to under-age children .
two-thirds of us would ban smoking in any public place , including pubs and clubs .
these figures suggest britain has turned against the weed .
with scotland set to follow ireland 's example and forbid people from lighting up in bars and restaurants , the momentum is firmly with the anti-smoking lobby .
yet a closer look at the figures suggests the issue is not quite that black and white .
when asked to choose from a range of options for work-places , the largest group -lrb- 44 % -rrb- preferred the idea of designated smoking areas to a ban .
one in five people thinks it should be up to individual employers to decide in consultation with staff .
less than a third - 32 % said they wanted total prohibition .
radicalism nevertheless , the survey shows that many of us do want a radical solution .
a majority -lrb- 53 % -rrb- want even higher tax on cigarettes .
a significant minority would like to see parents prosecuted if they let their under-age kids smoke , and a surprising proportion , even among smokers , believes the government should move towards making tobacco an illegal drug .
the same contradictions are evident in attitudes to how government should tackle obesity , alcohol abuse and sexually transmitted infections .

but as radley balko of the right-wing cato institute recently put it : " if the government is paying for my anti-cholesterol medication , what incentive is there for me to put down the cheeseburger ? "
he argues that healthy lifestyles should be rewarded and poor ones penalised , an idea we tested in our poll .
should people who refuse to take responsibility for their health have to contribute toward the cost of their care or even be denied nhs treatment ?
once again , sizeable minorities agreed with those ideas , suggesting that the debate about where responsibility lies is far from closed .
smokers , of course , can argue that they already pay far more in tax than it costs to treat them and currently it is politically inconceivable to undermine the principle of free-access to the nhs .
ministers have spent the past few weeks trying to formulate a " new labour " philosophy on public health and have concluded that it is not for politicians to tell people how to live their lives .
banning is not the new labour way .

but if government ministers were hoping the results would deliver solutions they will be frustrated .
one moment we want the government to ban anything which is bad for us , the next we say we do not think government should interfere in such matters .
many do n't want a total smoking ban for example , how does one reconcile these two findings in a poll commissioned by the bbc ?
almost 70 % of those questioned think the government should try to wean people off the fags .
yet 64 % believe that whether or not people smoke is a matter for them .
health poll : smoking key findings from the bbc 's poll on attitudes to public health in graphics it is the same story for alcohol - large majorities think government should encourage us to drink healthily but simultaneously believe how much people drink is up to them and government should butt out .
so what is going on ?
the bbc 's healthy britain survey is one of the most detailed snapshots of public opinion in this area ever taken .
anxiety and distrust britain is like a well-intentioned but fallible smoker .
it reveals a nation which is clearly anxious about public health and wants someone to make the problem go away .
but we are also a country that distrusts politicians and values individual freedoms .
we are torn .
" stop me , stop me ! " we say in one breath .
but when the image of that cream cake floats into our mind we balk at the idea of the " health police " coming between us and our waistline .
the phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has tried to give up smoking .
brimming with good intentions , we tell our friends that should they see us about to light up they have permission to snatch up the dreaded fags and crush them before our eyes .
but , of course , our friends would n't remain friends very long if they actually did such a thing .
faced with our failure , we expect sympathy and support .
britain is like that well-intentioned but fallible smoker .
mixed messages our survey shows that most people , -lrb- 55 % -rrb- would like to see the age youngsters can buy tobacco raised from 16 to 21 .
some 80 % think it should be raised to 18 .
we want government to get tougher with those who sell tobacco to under-age children .
obesity is a major problem two-thirds of us would ban smoking in any public place , including pubs and clubs .
these figures suggest britain has turned against the weed .
with scotland set to follow ireland 's example and forbid people from lighting up in bars and restaurants , the momentum is firmly with the anti-smoking lobby .
yet a closer look at the figures suggests the issue is not quite that black and white .
when asked to choose from a range of options for work-places , the largest group -lrb- 44 % -rrb- preferred the idea of designated smoking areas to a ban .
one in five people thinks it should be up to individual employers to decide in consultation with staff .
less than a third - 32 % said they wanted total prohibition .
radicalism nevertheless , the survey shows that many of us do want a radical solution .
a majority -lrb- 53 % -rrb- want even higher tax on cigarettes .
a significant minority would like to see parents prosecuted if they let their under-age kids smoke , and a surprising proportion , even among smokers , believes the government should move towards making tobacco an illegal drug .
