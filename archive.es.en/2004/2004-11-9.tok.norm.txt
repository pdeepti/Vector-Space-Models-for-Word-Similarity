with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .
if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

police said thousands of protesters along the route forced the convoy carrying 12 containers of spent fuel rods to make several stops before arriving at the gorleben storage facility in northern germany early tuesday .
the 60-hour shipment had left the waste retreatment plant at la hague in northern france late saturday but it was halted sunday afternoon after a young demonstrator who had chained himself to the railway was run over and killed .
the train resumed the trek late sunday and arrived monday in the town of dannenberg , the hotbed of the anti-nuclear protests , before being loaded onto 12 trucks for the last 20-kilometer stretch of the journey to gorleben .
an estimated 11,000 german officers were deployed to guard the consignment , which was the seventh to be returned to germany since 1996 .
the shipments are traditionally marred by protests by activists who argue they are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the greens party defended the government 's atomic energy policies , which include plans to phase out its nuclear power plants over the next two decades .

the 30-year-old t-mobile rider , who won the tour in 1997 and come runner-up five times , is a time trial specialist who in previous years would have looked to the discipline to put time on his rivals .
next year the tour will feature one less time trial than usual when it begins with a 19km time trial instead of the usual introductory , shorter prologue , which is also a race against the clock .
despite praising the organizers ' decision to run the race through his native germany for two days , the former olympic time trial champion in sydney said reducing the time trial opportunities was not to his liking .
" of course i appreciate that -lrb- the towns of -rrb- karlsruhe and pforzheim will feature on the race again .
but i do n't like the fact there are less time trials , " he told tuesday 's edition of berlin-based tageszeitung newspaper .
ullrich has not won the tour since record six-time winner lance armstrong made his comeback in 1999 after recovering from cancer , although when he rode for the bianchi team in 2003 ullrich finished a close second at only a minute behind the us postal rider .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc nuclear train reaches german depot a train carrying highly radioactive nuclear waste reached a german dump tuesday at the end of a 600-kilometer -lrb- 370-mile -rrb- odyssey from northern france clouded by the death of an environmentalist .
police said thousands of protesters along the route forced the convoy carrying 12 containers of spent fuel rods to make several stops before arriving at the gorleben storage facility in northern germany early tuesday .
the 60-hour shipment had left the waste retreatment plant at la hague in northern france late saturday but it was halted sunday afternoon after a young demonstrator who had chained himself to the railway was run over and killed .
the train resumed the trek late sunday and arrived monday in the town of dannenberg , the hotbed of the anti-nuclear protests , before being loaded onto 12 trucks for the last 20-kilometer stretch of the journey to gorleben .
an estimated 11,000 german officers were deployed to guard the consignment , which was the seventh to be returned to germany since 1996 .
the shipments are traditionally marred by protests by activists who argue they are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the greens party defended the government 's atomic energy policies , which include plans to phase out its nuclear power plants over the next two decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 us reaches out to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be a more familiar face in europe : colin powell outlining the goals of us foreign policy , secretary of state colin powell made clear to the eu that washington wants to establish good relations despite last year 's biter dispute over the iraq war . while europe faces the realities of another four years with president george w. bush at the helm of the only remaining superpower , secretary of state colin powell reassured eu leaders that his commander-and-chief is intent on building strong ties during his second term of office , " notwithstanding any disagreements that we had in the past . "
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

" as no political consensus on an extension could be achieved in belgium , it is intended to maintain brussels as a regional hub from 2008 onwards , " the statement said . " until then , dhl plans to keep activities running at the current scale at brussels airport . "
the german group said it plans to invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 390 million -rrb- in leipzig and to employ about 3,500 staff there by 2012 .
it said operations in the eastern german city could start early in 2008 .
" this is a location that would pave the way for the necessary growth of dhl in the future and provides the group with long-term planning security , " said klaus zumwinkel , chairman of the board of deutsche post .
plans for a european center in brussels broke down in mid-october on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of brussels airport .
negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government .

" as no political consensus on an extension could be achieved in belgium , it is intended to maintain brussels as a regional hub from 2008 onwards , " the statement said . " until then , dhl plans to keep activities running at the current scale at brussels airport . "
the german group said it plans to invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 390 million -rrb- in leipzig and to employ about 3,500 staff there by 2012 .
it said operations in the eastern german city could start early in 2008 .
" this is a location that would pave the way for the necessary growth of dhl in the future and provides the group with long-term planning security , " said klaus zumwinkel , chairman of the board of deutsche post .
plans for a european center in brussels broke down in mid-october on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of brussels airport .
negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .

overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

"
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

" as no political consensus on an extension could be achieved in belgium , it is intended to maintain brussels as a regional hub from 2008 onwards , " the statement said . " until then , dhl plans to keep activities running at the current scale at brussels airport . "
the german group said it plans to invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 390 million -rrb- in leipzig and to employ about 3,500 staff there by 2012 .
it said operations in the eastern german city could start early in 2008 .
" this is a location that would pave the way for the necessary growth of dhl in the future and provides the group with long-term planning security , " said klaus zumwinkel , chairman of the board of deutsche post .
plans for a european center in brussels broke down in mid-october on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of brussels airport .
negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 dutch muslims threatened after killing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a school where a bomb exploded following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . police are looking for suspects after a bomb exploded outside a muslim elementary school in eindhoven monday , injuring no one but adding to the tension and fear that has gripped holland in the last week . the bomb explosion is the latest in a series of attacks on muslim buildings since theo van gogh , 49 , a filmmaker and critic of radical islam , was shot and killed on his bicycle in amsterdam last tuesday .
mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .
" the hope is that politicians and the government will be held more responsible .

police said thousands of protesters along the route forced the convoy carrying 12 containers of spent fuel rods to make several stops before arriving at the gorleben storage facility in northern germany early tuesday .
the 60-hour shipment had left the waste retreatment plant at la hague in northern france late saturday but it was halted sunday afternoon after a young demonstrator who had chained himself to the railway was run over and killed .
the train resumed the trek late sunday and arrived monday in the town of dannenberg , the hotbed of the anti-nuclear protests , before being loaded onto 12 trucks for the last 20-kilometer stretch of the journey to gorleben .
an estimated 11,000 german officers were deployed to guard the consignment , which was the seventh to be returned to germany since 1996 .
the shipments are traditionally marred by protests by activists who argue they are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the greens party defended the government 's atomic energy policies , which include plans to phase out its nuclear power plants over the next two decades .

police said thousands of protesters along the route forced the convoy carrying 12 containers of spent fuel rods to make several stops before arriving at the gorleben storage facility in northern germany early tuesday .
the 60-hour shipment had left the waste retreatment plant at la hague in northern france late saturday but it was halted sunday afternoon after a young demonstrator who had chained himself to the railway was run over and killed .
the train resumed the trek late sunday and arrived monday in the town of dannenberg , the hotbed of the anti-nuclear protests , before being loaded onto 12 trucks for the last 20-kilometer stretch of the journey to gorleben .
an estimated 11,000 german officers were deployed to guard the consignment , which was the seventh to be returned to germany since 1996 .
the shipments are traditionally marred by protests by activists who argue they are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
environment minister jürgen trittin of the greens party defended the government 's atomic energy policies , which include plans to phase out its nuclear power plants over the next two decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 dutch muslims threatened after killing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a school where a bomb exploded following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . police are looking for suspects after a bomb exploded outside a muslim elementary school in eindhoven monday , injuring no one but adding to the tension and fear that has gripped holland in the last week . the bomb explosion is the latest in a series of attacks on muslim buildings since theo van gogh , 49 , a filmmaker and critic of radical islam , was shot and killed on his bicycle in amsterdam last tuesday .
mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .
if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.11.2004 opinion : britain isolates itself linguistically großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if all the world learns english , why should the brits learn anything else ?
britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .
no sorry from the queen queen elizabeth ii stopped short of apologizing for the allies ' bombing of dresden during her first state visit to germany in 12 years and instead acknowledged " the appalling suffering of war on both sides . "
-lrb- nov .
2 , 2004 -rrb- just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .

in the 12 months ending september 30 , the group made a net profit of € 61 million -lrb- $ 78.8 million dollars -rrb- , compared to a loss of € 435 million in its 2002/2003 fiscal year , it said in a statement .
earnings before interest and tax -lrb- ebit -rrb- amounted to € 256 million , against a loss of € 299 million a year earlier .
sales grew by 17 percent to € 7.195 billion .
" we were able to strongly increase revenues and operating cash flow during the last fiscal year but are not satisfied with the earnings , " said chief executive wolfgang ziebart .
" our primary goal for the upcoming years is to improve productivity and increase efficiency while containing our cost base . "
looking ahead , infineon said it expects a first quarter slowdown in several business segments as the world semiconductor market shrinks . the munich-based company cited an industry forecast that the semiconductor market will grow by a single-digit amount in 2005 after increasing by nearly 30 percent in dollar terms this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc jewish leader warns of far-right rise germany is on the brink of a strong rise by the extreme right , the leader of the country 's jewish community warned on tuesday , the 66th anniversary of a nazi-ordered assault on jews .
with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .

in the 12 months ending september 30 , the group made a net profit of € 61 million -lrb- $ 78.8 million dollars -rrb- , compared to a loss of € 435 million in its 2002/2003 fiscal year , it said in a statement .
earnings before interest and tax -lrb- ebit -rrb- amounted to € 256 million , against a loss of € 299 million a year earlier .
sales grew by 17 percent to € 7.195 billion .
" we were able to strongly increase revenues and operating cash flow during the last fiscal year but are not satisfied with the earnings , " said chief executive wolfgang ziebart .
" our primary goal for the upcoming years is to improve productivity and increase efficiency while containing our cost base . "
looking ahead , infineon said it expects a first quarter slowdown in several business segments as the world semiconductor market shrinks . the munich-based company cited an industry forecast that the semiconductor market will grow by a single-digit amount in 2005 after increasing by nearly 30 percent in dollar terms this year .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .
if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 dutch muslims threatened after killing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a school where a bomb exploded following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . police are looking for suspects after a bomb exploded outside a muslim elementary school in eindhoven monday , injuring no one but adding to the tension and fear that has gripped holland in the last week . the bomb explosion is the latest in a series of attacks on muslim buildings since theo van gogh , 49 , a filmmaker and critic of radical islam , was shot and killed on his bicycle in amsterdam last tuesday .
mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .

with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .
if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

" as no political consensus on an extension could be achieved in belgium , it is intended to maintain brussels as a regional hub from 2008 onwards , " the statement said . " until then , dhl plans to keep activities running at the current scale at brussels airport . "
the german group said it plans to invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 390 million -rrb- in leipzig and to employ about 3,500 staff there by 2012 .
it said operations in the eastern german city could start early in 2008 .
" this is a location that would pave the way for the necessary growth of dhl in the future and provides the group with long-term planning security , " said klaus zumwinkel , chairman of the board of deutsche post .
plans for a european center in brussels broke down in mid-october on belgian demands for tighter limits on the number of night flights out of brussels airport .
negotiations between federal and regional governments at one stage even threatened to topple the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 iran demands more eu flexibility on nuke deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani -lrb- left -rrb- said a preliminary deal with the eu is unfair to iran a top iranian regime official has warned britain , france and germany that the islamic republic could harden its stance if the eu failed to show flexibility in the stalled nuclear negotiations . " if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

"
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .
no sorry from the queen queen elizabeth ii stopped short of apologizing for the allies ' bombing of dresden during her first state visit to germany in 12 years and instead acknowledged " the appalling suffering of war on both sides . "

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .

with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .

a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "

german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc jewish leader warns of far-right rise germany is on the brink of a strong rise by the extreme right , the leader of the country 's jewish community warned on tuesday , the 66th anniversary of a nazi-ordered assault on jews .
with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .

" the two sides must learn from each other , " said de hoop scheffer at the berlin press club monday .
" europe can not unite against the united states , that would only end up dividing europe . " germany 's dilemma late last month , us general james jones , the supreme allied commander in iraq , indicated that 16 or 17 of the 26 nato countries were ready to participate in training iraqi security forces . most of the countries which said they were ready to begin training are already serving as part of the us-led coalition in iraq . france and germany , key opponents of the war in iraq , agreed to contribute to a nato security training program , but only outside of iraq . but germany now faces a dilemma .
the issue unleashed debate in berlin about the government 's withdrawal of german officers from nato forces set to be deployed in iraq as advisers in january .
the government stands firm on its decision not to allow its forces to set foot in the war-torn country , while the opposition wants to see germany actively participating in nato programs within iraq . a blow to nato solidarity de hoop scheffer said he understood berlin 's position , but also pointed out that it undermined nato solidarity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day after iraq 's government declared a 60-day state of emergency , the nato secretary general emphasized the need for iraq to gain stability ahead of january 's elections , saying this was the goal of the training program . " i believe that for as long as we have a consensus on security policy , for example as far as the training missions in iraq are concerned , then we can not accept that member states signal political approval of the mission while refusing to allow their nato officers to actually participate , " he said . nato 's role to grow the former dutch foreign minister also stressed that nato 's role in overseas missions is set to expand . " the demand on nato to run missions will increase and not diminish , " he said .
" i doubt if all parliaments and all parliamentarians understand this . " urging leaders to drive a debate on changing security needs to avoid a repeat of the transatlantic rifts exposed by the us-led strike on iraq , de hoop scheffer said politicians had to accept the need for a stronger alliance . " everybody realises that what happened a year ago should never happen again .
uniting europe against the united states is a non-starter , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "

"
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

"
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .

the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .

diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 us reaches out to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be a more familiar face in europe : colin powell outlining the goals of us foreign policy , secretary of state colin powell made clear to the eu that washington wants to establish good relations despite last year 's biter dispute over the iraq war . while europe faces the realities of another four years with president george w. bush at the helm of the only remaining superpower , secretary of state colin powell reassured eu leaders that his commander-and-chief is intent on building strong ties during his second term of office , " notwithstanding any disagreements that we had in the past . "
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

" the two sides must learn from each other , " said de hoop scheffer at the berlin press club monday .
" europe can not unite against the united states , that would only end up dividing europe . " germany 's dilemma late last month , us general james jones , the supreme allied commander in iraq , indicated that 16 or 17 of the 26 nato countries were ready to participate in training iraqi security forces . most of the countries which said they were ready to begin training are already serving as part of the us-led coalition in iraq . france and germany , key opponents of the war in iraq , agreed to contribute to a nato security training program , but only outside of iraq . but germany now faces a dilemma .
the issue unleashed debate in berlin about the government 's withdrawal of german officers from nato forces set to be deployed in iraq as advisers in january .
the government stands firm on its decision not to allow its forces to set foot in the war-torn country , while the opposition wants to see germany actively participating in nato programs within iraq . a blow to nato solidarity de hoop scheffer said he understood berlin 's position , but also pointed out that it undermined nato solidarity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day after iraq 's government declared a 60-day state of emergency , the nato secretary general emphasized the need for iraq to gain stability ahead of january 's elections , saying this was the goal of the training program . " i believe that for as long as we have a consensus on security policy , for example as far as the training missions in iraq are concerned , then we can not accept that member states signal political approval of the mission while refusing to allow their nato officers to actually participate , " he said . nato 's role to grow the former dutch foreign minister also stressed that nato 's role in overseas missions is set to expand . " the demand on nato to run missions will increase and not diminish , " he said .
" i doubt if all parliaments and all parliamentarians understand this . " urging leaders to drive a debate on changing security needs to avoid a repeat of the transatlantic rifts exposed by the us-led strike on iraq , de hoop scheffer said politicians had to accept the need for a stronger alliance . " everybody realises that what happened a year ago should never happen again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc jewish leader warns of far-right rise germany is on the brink of a strong rise by the extreme right , the leader of the country 's jewish community warned on tuesday , the 66th anniversary of a nazi-ordered assault on jews .
with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .

a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .

some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

"
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 us reaches out to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be a more familiar face in europe : colin powell outlining the goals of us foreign policy , secretary of state colin powell made clear to the eu that washington wants to establish good relations despite last year 's biter dispute over the iraq war . while europe faces the realities of another four years with president george w. bush at the helm of the only remaining superpower , secretary of state colin powell reassured eu leaders that his commander-and-chief is intent on building strong ties during his second term of office , " notwithstanding any disagreements that we had in the past . "
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 iran demands more eu flexibility on nuke deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafsanjani -lrb- left -rrb- said a preliminary deal with the eu is unfair to iran a top iranian regime official has warned britain , france and germany that the islamic republic could harden its stance if the eu failed to show flexibility in the stalled nuclear negotiations . " if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- already agreeing an electoral alliance , and calls for the far-right republikaner to join them , paul spiegel described the situation as being " five minutes to midnight " .
spiegel said events that would have caused uproar a few years ago , such as the desecration of jewish cemeteries and the exhortations of extremist parties , were failing to attract the same attention now .
" where is the outcry ? " he asked in an interview with deutschlandradio .
pointing to the recent election of a committed neo-nazi into the npd 's party leadership , spiegel said such an event would have been unthinkable just a few years ago .
sixty-six years after over 7,500 jewish shops were destroyed and 400 synagogues burned down on adolf hitler 's orders in what became known as " kristallnacht " or the night of broken glass , spiegel called for an " uprising of decent people " .
the jewish leader said he had received little reaction to his proposal for a round table between representatives of the jewish community , experts and politicians .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .

diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.11.2004 opinion : britain isolates itself linguistically großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if all the world learns english , why should the brits learn anything else ?
britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen speaks english , even in germany .
for the uk 's ties with germany , which are already suffering under a nasty press campaign centering around queen elizabeth 's recent visit to germany and historically prejudiced national stereotypes , the decline in people studying german certainly wo n't help .
no matter what government-funded cultural institutions like the goethe institute do , if people are n't able or willing to communicate in the language , no amount of special programs and awareness campaigns can counteract the very british island mentality . kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-british ties good , but still faulty dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british .
no sorry from the queen queen elizabeth ii stopped short of apologizing for the allies ' bombing of dresden during her first state visit to germany in 12 years and instead acknowledged " the appalling suffering of war on both sides . "
-lrb- nov .
2 , 2004 -rrb- just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .

mosques in five dutch towns and cities were defaced or suffered fire damage over the weekend . police arrested a moroccan man on friday with reportedly close ties to islamic fundamentalists in holland . navel-gazing , tough measures after killing on monday , far-right protestors marched in amsterdam and rotterdam against the killing of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh in 2001 filmmaker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had recently completed a film on the treatment of women in islam .
the marches come at a time when the netherlands , which had long prided itself on a liberal and open immigration policy , is radically reconsidering its relationship to its muslim communities . " the tiller needs to be pulled in the other direction , " rita verdonk , the country 's conservative integration minister , said last week .
" we 've thought for too long that we have a multicultural society . " following the killing , verdonk announced reportedly long-planned measures that aim to control what is being preached in the country 's mosques .
in the future , imams will only receive residency permits once they pass quran tests .
the goal is to eventually get the imams to preach western values in the dutch language . her proposals have caused an uproar in the liberal country 's muslim community who say the government is trying to dictate to imams how the quran is to be interpreted . muslim leaders have urged calm in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric and accusations since the killing . " we need to show in different ways that muslims as well treasure freedom of speech and condemn violence , " mohamed sioni , from the foundation , islam and citizenship said in a newspaper interview . pim 's populist ghost rises again but the opposite seems to be happening .
populism in the spirit of pim fortuyn , the anti-immigrant dutch politician assassinated in may 2002 -lrb- photo -rrb- , is taking hold .
geert wilders , who some see as the successor to fortuyn , announced this week that he is starting a new party aimed at curbing immigration from muslim countries like morocco and turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pim fortuyn " one of the focal points of this movement is going to be to deal effectively with growing muslim extremism in holland , " a wilders spokesman told reuters .
" the hope is that politicians and the government will be held more responsible .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .

a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "

german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .
a blow to european relations the fact that fewer brits are learning foreign languages does not help improve their image in continental europe , where the island nation is already perceived as largely euroskeptic and " very british " is not necessarily a neutral adjective .
having rejected the common european currency and with the likelihood of a " no " on the eu constitution referendum looming , the least tony blair 's government could do would be to encourage more people to learn a european language - if not only to read a menu at a tourist hotspot .

this year , she 's releasing her report a month early , with the bad news that the forests are worse off than ever . germany 's trees are stressed out .
according to the foresters who trek through the country 's woodlands each summer noting signs of illness , the top stress factor is climate change . summers in germany have been much hotter than normal over the past few years .
the excessive heat has not only dried out the trees , it 's also provided ideal conditions for tree-damaging pests , such as the bark beetle , to multiply faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bark beetles are expected to be an even bigger problem next summer bark beetles eat their way deep inside the tree 's trunk , weakening it from the inside .
if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.11.2004 us reaches out to europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be a more familiar face in europe : colin powell outlining the goals of us foreign policy , secretary of state colin powell made clear to the eu that washington wants to establish good relations despite last year 's biter dispute over the iraq war . while europe faces the realities of another four years with president george w. bush at the helm of the only remaining superpower , secretary of state colin powell reassured eu leaders that his commander-and-chief is intent on building strong ties during his second term of office , " notwithstanding any disagreements that we had in the past . "
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

if the coming spring is a mild one , then next summer could see a bark beetle epidemic - a " ticking time-bomb , " according to the environment ministry . beech , oak worst affected the figures in its 2004 report are alarming .
the ministry concluded that 31 percent of the nation 's trees fall under the highest level of damage , meaning that the treetop is completely dead .
it 's the highest figure since germany began producing the annual report in 1984 .
beech trees are the worst affected , with over 50 percent of trees bearing damaged tops .
oak trees are the second worst affected . the association for the protection of german forests -lrb- sdw -rrb- said the figures in künast 's report do n't come as a surprise . " we expected this , " sdw spokeswoman sabine krömer-butz told deutschlandfunk .
" we 've been saying for years that the apparent stabilization in the health of our forests was deceptive .
as soon as something out of the ordinary happens - a change in climate or a new kind of insect - we 've seen that the forests just ca n't react .
the number of sick trees was instantly higher , the number of trees losing leaves and needles rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is another stress factor for germany 's forests " there 's not going to be an easy solution , " künast warned as she presented the report 's findings at greens state party conference .
" it 's probably going to take many years before the forests revert to their past state , assuming that they wo n't again be subjected to severe stress . " government action plan the federal government is now planning to rejuvenate the forests by cutting down sick trees and planting new ones .
but it remains to be seen whether the plan can survive an unexpected threat - the increasing numbers of wild boar and deer roaming the forests , who especially like to feed on tender saplings . künast 's ministry has a plan to counter this threat too , namely by allowing more game hunting in future . kerstin hilt -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .

britain is an island nation and in no way is this more visible than in the country 's stance on foreign languages .
now , plans to futher cut the foreign language requirement in schools have caused an uproar . from brussels to berlin , european diplomats and politicians all speak english .
but when was the last time tony blair tried to grapple with the accents and umlauts of french and german ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european affair - but in which language ?
-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .

-lrb- jacques chirac , left , gerhard schröder , center , tony blair -rrb- brits seem ready to leave the translation exercises to those whose language is not spoken in every corner of the globe .
a new study shows that things wo n't be changing any time soon .
a survey by the national center for languages -lrb- cilt -rrb- - britain 's language teaching authority - has shown that the country is getting even more monolingual , with fewer children signing up for language lessons at school .
monolingual schooling under pressure to offer more diverse curriculums for 14-19 year olds and free up instruction time for " vocational " subjects , most schools across great britain have dropped foreign language requirements for graduation .
only one in three state schools makes language learning compulsory until the age of 16 , the cilt reported .
that number is down considerably from last year , when 57 percent of all schools in the state sector still required foreign language courses for pupils .
" this will leave school leavers short of vital skills and affect the competitiveness of british business , " cilt director isabella moore said .
curriculum decisions are being made without consideration of the vocational relevance of languages in an increasingly interconnected society , moore said : " with 70 percent of business now involved in some form of international activity , the idea that languages are just for ' academic ' pupils is shortsighted and damaging to the economy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is multi-lingual in her comments on the study , the head of cilt argued that there was an " urgent need " to reconsider language education policy and disseminate the positive aspects of speaking a foreign language .
german , french hard hit perhaps the decline also reflects britain 's sentiments regarding the european union .
is it not ironic that the two languages most adversely affected by the change in curriculum are the ones spoken in the bloc 's two biggest economies : germany and france .
according to the center , of those schools allowing pupils to drop language study , 72 percent reported a decline in enrollment numbers for french courses , and 70 percent saw a fall in german .
spanish courses , on the other hand , held on to their enrollment numbers in state schools , while in private schools the language of sunny holiday destinations even grew in popularity .
some schools in both the state and private sector have also begun experimenting with offering a wider range of languages including chinese , russian and japanese , which compete with the traditional european languages for enrollment numbers .

"
speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .

although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "

although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .

" the two sides must learn from each other , " said de hoop scheffer at the berlin press club monday .
" europe can not unite against the united states , that would only end up dividing europe . " germany 's dilemma late last month , us general james jones , the supreme allied commander in iraq , indicated that 16 or 17 of the 26 nato countries were ready to participate in training iraqi security forces . most of the countries which said they were ready to begin training are already serving as part of the us-led coalition in iraq . france and germany , key opponents of the war in iraq , agreed to contribute to a nato security training program , but only outside of iraq . but germany now faces a dilemma .
the issue unleashed debate in berlin about the government 's withdrawal of german officers from nato forces set to be deployed in iraq as advisers in january .
the government stands firm on its decision not to allow its forces to set foot in the war-torn country , while the opposition wants to see germany actively participating in nato programs within iraq . a blow to nato solidarity de hoop scheffer said he understood berlin 's position , but also pointed out that it undermined nato solidarity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a day after iraq 's government declared a 60-day state of emergency , the nato secretary general emphasized the need for iraq to gain stability ahead of january 's elections , saying this was the goal of the training program . " i believe that for as long as we have a consensus on security policy , for example as far as the training missions in iraq are concerned , then we can not accept that member states signal political approval of the mission while refusing to allow their nato officers to actually participate , " he said . nato 's role to grow the former dutch foreign minister also stressed that nato 's role in overseas missions is set to expand . " the demand on nato to run missions will increase and not diminish , " he said .
" i doubt if all parliaments and all parliamentarians understand this . " urging leaders to drive a debate on changing security needs to avoid a repeat of the transatlantic rifts exposed by the us-led strike on iraq , de hoop scheffer said politicians had to accept the need for a stronger alliance . " everybody realises that what happened a year ago should never happen again .
uniting europe against the united states is a non-starter , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

speaking to reporters as he flew to mexico city in his first official visit since last week 's presidential elections , powell said europe was important to the united states .
he plans to visit the continent in the next few weeks for meetings with officials from the eu , nato and the organization for security and cooperation in europe .
" i 'll be spending a lot of time in europe in the weeks coming up , " he said , " just to make sure our european friends have no illusions that the president wants to have a strong relationship with all of our european friends and allies . "
overcoming differences powell 's message was directed particularly to those european nations who opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
prior to and during the war , the european union was sharply divided over support for the american military operation to topple saddam hussein .
whereas france and germany were adamantly opposed to the war and accused bush of " adventurism , " british troops lined up side-by-side with their us counterparts .
since combat operations ended and the us handed over civil control to an interim iraqi government in june , transatlantic relations have continued to be strained over washington 's efforts to rebuild the country and european - particularly french and german - reluctance to provide troops to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youth in bochum protest against the us-led war in iraq and president bush , on march 20 , 2003 .
although paris and berlin have toned down their verbal attacks against the us and both have congratulated bush on his re-election , there has not been much sign of a genuine warming of relations where iraq and foreign policy in general is concerned .
french president jacques chirac , for example , has said paris will not forget its differences with washington and that a stronger europe was the natural response to us foreign policy assertiveness .
like chirac , when it comes to eu-us relations , many europeans see the iraq issue as the prime example of washington 's unilateral and aggressive foreign policy .
middle east as middle ground referring to the european position and growing anti-americanism , powell said , " i understand the importance of iraq ; i understand the overhang that that and the middle east have on how we are viewed in the world and the impression that some people have of us . "
that will change over time , he added and pointed to areas like the middle east where the united states and europe can and should work together to find a common solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arafat 's death will leave a power vacuum in the palestinian authority as if to demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation , washington on monday said us and eu officials had met on friday to discuss efforts to revive the middle east " road map " peace plan and how the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat would change the " realities in the region . "
although white house officials played down the significance of the meeting , which was not made public until monday , diplomatic sources said the fact that officials from france , germany and britain took part in the talks was a positive sign of growing transatlantic coordination on an issue that had divided the two sides in the past .
the road map is expected to be a major focus of talks this week between bush and british prime minister tony blair , who has been pushing his american ally to make middle east peace a high priority in his next administration . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .
the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .
25 deadline has passed .
european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .
but washington 's hardliners have refused to join forces with the eu , insisting that tehran forfeited the right to its own nuclear program by keeping its nuclear fuel production research hidden for almost two decades . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu reach preliminary nukes agreement iranian and european union officials have reached a " preliminary agreement " on easing alarm over the islamic republic 's nuclear program following crucial negotiations in paris , a top iranian official said sunday .

the deal centers on a verifiable suspension of uranium enrichment and threatens with a referral to the un security council and possible punitive action if the situation does not improve by nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency convenes to discuss iran .
diplomatic promises the european union , which has been following a course of diplomatic engagement with regard to iran in the hopes that a full-fledge conflict between the islamic republic and the us can be avoided , has said iran must indefinitely and fully suspend uranium enrichment .
iran , however , insists its right to enrichment , which can be used either as fuel for a civilian power reactor or as the core of nuclear weapons , can not be called into question .
tehran officials claim the nuclear program is used purely for civilian means to generate electricity .
the united states accuses iran of using its atomic energy program as a front for developing weapons and has been pushing for the iaea to refer the issue to the security council for sanctions .
washington did not participate in the eu deal and has been skeptical of the european trio 's effectiveness in convincing iran to stop its enrichment activities .
" ultimately , it 's what iran does that matters , not just what they might agree to , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in washington after the preliminary agreement between iran and the eu was announced .
us remains skeptical " ultimately , we shall see not only if iran and the europeans are able to reach agreement on how iran can comply with the -lrb- iaea -rrb- board 's requirements , but whether the iaea was able to verify that , " boucher said .
observers , however , say the eu deal has no chance of succeeding without washington 's backing .
" in the long run , i do n't think this deal can work without the us buying into it , " david albright , a former un weapons inspector and head of the institute for science and international security , told reuters .
albright said the deal can work for six months or so , but not for a longer period of time .
" one problem is that iran can suspend for six months , then resume enrichment and somehow blame the eu , " for not upholding its part of the bargain , he added .
several diplomats have also said iran might consider suspending enrichment now to avoid the security council and then pick a fight with the eu after the nov .

european diplomats and officials from the iaea have said us participation would give much-needed strength to the eu initiative .

" if the europeans are rational , we can make some assurances ... but if they put their foot down , then our attitude will change , " former president and influential spokesman akbar hashemi rafsanjani was quoted as saying by the hamshahri newspaper .
the powerful ex-leader has criticized the " preliminary agreement " reached sunday between iran and the european union over tehran 's nuclear program as being unfair to the islamic republic .
the deal , which diplomats from britain , france and germany hammered out during two days of negotiations , calls for the suspension of iran 's uranium enrichment program for an unspecified period in exchange for peaceful atomic technology and economic incentives .
but many in iran regard the deal as detrimental to iran .
" this technology has been achieved by our people by our own means , and others can not put an end to it , " said rafsanjani , who now heads iran 's top political arbitration body the expediency council .

red squirrels in other parts of the country are facing potential extinction due to the squirrel pox virus which is relatively harmless to greys .
kielder forest is home to about 70 % of england 's red squirrel population .
researchers have found the dense conifers make it difficult for greys to penetrate and pass on the virus .
the squirrel pox virus poses one of the biggest challenges to the creature 's continued existence in england , the forestry commission said .
fighting chance for the past three years the commission , newcastle university and queen mary , university of london supported by mammals trust uk , have worked on a pioneering project in kielder forest as part of a wider initiative to conserve the species in northern england .
researchers have looked at the likely impact of the disease when greys arrive in significant numbers at the edges of the forest from scotland and northern england within the next five to 10 years .
while infectious grey squirrels are likely to cause localised extinctions of reds in kielder , this should not irrevocably affect the core population and numbers should recover .
the main reason is that red squirrels succumb to the pox virus rapidly and any squirrels that become infected at the edge of kielder are unlikely to transmit the disease to the core population and the disease burns out .
bill burlton , from the forestry commission , said : " this research breaks new ground .
" squirrel pox has always been a shadow hanging over our efforts to improve the habitat for reds , so we are pleased that at least in kielder the models indicate we have a fighting chance of keeping a viable population . "

red squirrels in other parts of the country are facing potential extinction due to the squirrel pox virus which is relatively harmless to greys .
kielder forest is home to about 70 % of england 's red squirrel population .
researchers have found the dense conifers make it difficult for greys to penetrate and pass on the virus .
the squirrel pox virus poses one of the biggest challenges to the creature 's continued existence in england , the forestry commission said .
fighting chance for the past three years the commission , newcastle university and queen mary , university of london supported by mammals trust uk , have worked on a pioneering project in kielder forest as part of a wider initiative to conserve the species in northern england .
researchers have looked at the likely impact of the disease when greys arrive in significant numbers at the edges of the forest from scotland and northern england within the next five to 10 years .
while infectious grey squirrels are likely to cause localised extinctions of reds in kielder , this should not irrevocably affect the core population and numbers should recover .
the main reason is that red squirrels succumb to the pox virus rapidly and any squirrels that become infected at the edge of kielder are unlikely to transmit the disease to the core population and the disease burns out .

red squirrels in other parts of the country are facing potential extinction due to the squirrel pox virus which is relatively harmless to greys .
kielder forest is home to about 70 % of england 's red squirrel population .
researchers have found the dense conifers make it difficult for greys to penetrate and pass on the virus .
the squirrel pox virus poses one of the biggest challenges to the creature 's continued existence in england , the forestry commission said .
fighting chance for the past three years the commission , newcastle university and queen mary , university of london supported by mammals trust uk , have worked on a pioneering project in kielder forest as part of a wider initiative to conserve the species in northern england .
researchers have looked at the likely impact of the disease when greys arrive in significant numbers at the edges of the forest from scotland and northern england within the next five to 10 years .
while infectious grey squirrels are likely to cause localised extinctions of reds in kielder , this should not irrevocably affect the core population and numbers should recover .
the main reason is that red squirrels succumb to the pox virus rapidly and any squirrels that become infected at the edge of kielder are unlikely to transmit the disease to the core population and the disease burns out .
bill burlton , from the forestry commission , said : " this research breaks new ground .

laura rhodes , from neath , south wales , died in september after an apparent suicide pact with a friend .
her parents , yvonne and mike rhodes , said laura was bullied at cefn saeson comprehensive school , in neath .
school headteacher alun griffiths has said " a range of strategies " was used to tackle the bullying claims .
mr and mrs rhodes claim cefn saeson failed to take the bullying claims seriously enough and have called for schools to be required to record how problems are dealt with .
mrs rhodes told bbc wales ' week in week out programme her daughter became increasingly isolated and withdrawn after joining cefn saeson .
laura rhodes died in september " she felt she did n't have any control over what was happening to her , and she wanted us to stop the bullying , " said mrs rhodes .
" we were asking for it to be stopped , but we were n't getting anywhere .
" i want everyone to know that laura was a bullied child , - she was n't mentally ill , she was n't anything other than a bullied child . "
school head mr griffiths said laura last attended the school 13 months before her death , and that the school had " used a whole range of strategies to address her allegations of bullying " .
mr griffiths and neath port talbot education authority declined to be interviewed for the week in week out programme .
laura was referred to bryncoch pupil referraluunit after 10 months at cefn saeson but , at the time of her death , discussions were taking place about a possible return to the school .
in a letter released after her death , laura wrote of being verbally and physically abused over her weight and speculation about her sexuality .
if a child complains that they are being bullied , it 's vital that the school take it seriously , listen to it , and act on it peter clarke , children 's commissioner for wales shortly before laura died , she and friend rebecca ling , 14 , had sparked a police hunt after going missing , before they were found in bath .
after returning to neath , laura died after taking an overdose of tablets , but rebecca survived and is still recovering .
south wales police have carried out an investigation , and said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding laura 's death .
an inquest is expected to be held in the new year .

the avenham estate , in preston , was sold off to a housing association five years ago with more than half of the houses and flats left empty .
but since the revamp , there is now a waiting list of people keen to get a new home there .
the estate is now being held up as an example of how areas can be redesigned for the 21st century .
tracey masheter , chair of the avenquest housing association , said : " it 's totally changed , nobody can recognise it from five years ago .

brake said a hard-hitting message it was launching on tuesday aimed to highlight rising casualty figures in northern ireland .
more than a third of fatal crashes involved drink or drugs , it said .
the campaign is being launched in belfast by the sister of a drink drive victim .
aileen tester 's brother , robert bradley , was killed by a drink driver as he walked home after a night out at university .
robert , 20 , from londonderry and his friend , alex veeder , 21 , from manchester , were killed after a driver sped the wrong way down a one-way street in nottingham in 2000 .
" drinking and driving devastates innocent lives , " said aileen . "
if drivers could see such carnage - see us cut the lifeless bodies of victims from the mangled wreckage of vehicles - i am sure they would not be so quick to get behind the wheel of a vehicle after drinking " chris kerr fire brigade belfast area commander " even getting behind the wheel after drinking small amounts of alcohol can lead to a fatal crash .
" i urge anyone who thinks drinking and driving is okay to think of the traumatic loss that bereaved families suffer .
the message to drivers is simple : do n't drink and drive . "
brake said the latest police statistics showed fatalities caused by drunk or drugged drivers in northern ireland had increased by 50 % over the past decade - from 25 deaths in 1993 to 37 deaths in 2003 .
the figures also showed that in 2003 , alcohol or drugs was the single biggest factor in northern ireland fatal collisions , with speed a close second .
' massively influenced ' however , david lyle , whose company has been behind advertisements for road safety , insisted the " do n't drink and drive " message was getting through .
" they are working fantastically well , " he told bbc radio ulster on tuesday .
" in the year 2003 , out of the 29 fatal collisions caused by driver alcohol and drugs in northern ireland , eight of those collisions were caused by young drivers aged 17 to 24 . "
he added : " we are continually polling people and tracking the evidence in these ads .
young people are massively influenced by them .
" year in , year out , month in , month out , we record the highest influence scores for these ads - 79 % of young people aged 17 to 24 are influenced by them . "
chris kerr , the fire brigade area commander for belfast , said firefighters were increasingly called to attend horrific road crashes - often as a result of drink related driving .
" if drivers could see such carnage - see us cut the lifeless bodies of victims from the mangled wreckage of vehicles - i am sure they would not be so quick to get behind the wheel of a vehicle after drinking , " he said .

brake said a hard-hitting message it was launching on tuesday aimed to highlight rising casualty figures in northern ireland .
more than a third of fatal crashes involved drink or drugs , it said .
the campaign is being launched in belfast by the sister of a drink drive victim .
aileen tester 's brother , robert bradley , was killed by a drink driver as he walked home after a night out at university .
robert , 20 , from londonderry and his friend , alex veeder , 21 , from manchester , were killed after a driver sped the wrong way down a one-way street in nottingham in 2000 .
" drinking and driving devastates innocent lives , " said aileen .
if drivers could see such carnage - see us cut the lifeless bodies of victims from the mangled wreckage of vehicles - i am sure they would not be so quick to get behind the wheel of a vehicle after drinking chris kerr fire brigade belfast area commander " even getting behind the wheel after drinking small amounts of alcohol can lead to a fatal crash .
" i urge anyone who thinks drinking and driving is okay to think of the traumatic loss that bereaved families suffer .
the message to drivers is simple : do n't drink and drive . "
brake said the latest police statistics showed fatalities caused by drunk or drugged drivers in northern ireland had increased by 50 % over the past decade - from 25 deaths in 1993 to 37 deaths in 2003 .
the figures also showed that in 2003 , alcohol or drugs was the single biggest factor in northern ireland fatal collisions , with speed a close second .
' massively influenced ' however , david lyle , whose company has been behind advertisements for road safety , insisted the " do n't drink and drive " message was getting through .
" they are working fantastically well , " he told bbc radio ulster on tuesday .
" in the year 2003 , out of the 29 fatal collisions caused by driver alcohol and drugs in northern ireland , eight of those collisions were caused by young drivers aged 17 to 24 . "
he added : " we are continually polling people and tracking the evidence in these ads .
young people are massively influenced by them .
" year in , year out , month in , month out , we record the highest influence scores for these ads - 79 % of young people aged 17 to 24 are influenced by them . "

kevin brennan will ask fellow mps on tuesday to target what he describes as " corporate nuisance calls " .
his bill would make it easier to prosecute the companies responsible , and trace the calls when their identity is withheld .
although it stands little chance of becoming law soon , he hopes it will persuade the government to act .
lynne sellers , who lives in mr brennan 's cardiff west constituency , said she had been bothered at home by cold callers .
ms sellers said that she had taken repeated calls from companies while at home on time off work due to illness .
although she once had a job selling windows , she told the bbc wales news website that she had no sympathy with the sales companies . "
" if it happens a lot you start to think that you 're being stalked " " lynne sellers " i never noticed how much they ring before because i was at work , " she said .
" but now it 's a real pain - the phone keeps ringing and ringing .
sometimes i do actually listen , but usually i just hang up . "
the calls are often made by computerised dialling equipment .
numbers are dialled at random , but when there are not enough operators , there may be no reply when the phone is answered .
these " silent calls " are mr brennan 's main concern .
" many people are distressed when they receive silent calls , but do not realise that many of these calls come from firms selling products and services over the phone , " he said .
for mrs sellers , these calls are the worst of all .
" if it happens a lot you start to think you 're being stalked , " she said .
" often , i do n't answer my phone unless i know someone 's going to ring . "
jo smith finds the repeated calls annoying when she is at home looking after her son , sam .
" it 's always for things you 've already got , and they always ring at tea-time , " she said .
" if i want something , i 'll make my own inquiries .
i would never buy anything over the phone . "
although her husband is a sales rep , she said she was blunt when turning sales offers down .
" i 'm quite rude actually .
i just say i 'm not interested and hang up . "
how to avoid the cold-callers contact the companies directly register with the telephone preference service mr brennan wants the government to force the industry to act to prevent people from receiving calls from marketing companies .
" it is outrageous that vulnerable people are being subjected to unnecessary and frightening nuisance calls by corporate concerns , " he said .
one option for householders is signing up to the telephone preference service - by registering your phone number the service puts companies under a legal obligation to stop making unsolicited calls .
