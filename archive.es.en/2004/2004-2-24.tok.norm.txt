i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .

my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .

when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .

i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .

i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .

" made in germany " means to me a seal of quality and reliability , " a " for a good product at an affordable price .
but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .
for me " made in germany " is a label of quality and decency .
in fact , i chose a saab -lrb- 25 % made in germany -rrb- rather than a vw -lrb- made in mexico -rrb- , and i am happy to drive it . - harrison picot , haymarket , virginia , usa germany still has the best technology with reliability and more sustainability than its counterparts , like japan and upcoming south korea .
however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .

the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .

" this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning .

he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .

" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2004 germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder enjoys a warm welcome from turkish leader tayyip erdogan .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .
" one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .

friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .

agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .

he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .
all three are now connected via a digital video line .
but after the recent cuts in germany 's health care system , free computer scans to emergency patients from east of the border are something the radiologists in zittau wo n't be able to offer any longer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .

thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .

also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .

but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .
for me " made in germany " is a label of quality and decency .
in fact , i chose a saab -lrb- 25 % made in germany -rrb- rather than a vw -lrb- made in mexico -rrb- , and i am happy to drive it . - harrison picot , haymarket , virginia , usa germany still has the best technology with reliability and more sustainability than its counterparts , like japan and upcoming south korea .
however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .
i am glad that i could keep the faith in products " made in germany " . - m. joevalan vaz , coimbatore , tamil nadu , india send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch .

it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .
" americans are still going to buy their bmws and think they 're great . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .
" one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word .

on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .

maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .

instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .

the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .

he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2004 germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder enjoys a warm welcome from turkish leader tayyip erdogan .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .

however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .

so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .

" made in germany " means to me a seal of quality and reliability , " a " for a good product at an affordable price .
but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .
for me " made in germany " is a label of quality and decency .
in fact , i chose a saab -lrb- 25 % made in germany -rrb- rather than a vw -lrb- made in mexico -rrb- , and i am happy to drive it . - harrison picot , haymarket , virginia , usa germany still has the best technology with reliability and more sustainability than its counterparts , like japan and upcoming south korea .
however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .

it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.02.2004 doctors across borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german perspective for eastern european doctors .
eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .
all three are now connected via a digital video line .

" made in germany " means to me a seal of quality and reliability , " a " for a good product at an affordable price .
but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .
for me " made in germany " is a label of quality and decency .
in fact , i chose a saab -lrb- 25 % made in germany -rrb- rather than a vw -lrb- made in mexico -rrb- , and i am happy to drive it . - harrison picot , haymarket , virginia , usa germany still has the best technology with reliability and more sustainability than its counterparts , like japan and upcoming south korea .
however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .
i am glad that i could keep the faith in products " made in germany " . - m. joevalan vaz , coimbatore , tamil nadu , india send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch .

but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .

however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .
i am glad that i could keep the faith in products " made in germany " . - m. joevalan vaz , coimbatore , tamil nadu , india send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

the investigation comes after last week 's acquittal of 16 people charged with criminal negligence in the inferno , austria 's most deadly peacetime disaster .
thomas wegleiter , a spokesman for the public prosecutor 's office in salzburg said that the investigation could lead to charges against the manufacturer , germany-based fakir . lawyers for cable car operator gletscherbahnen kaprun ag , some of whose employees were among those acquitted last week , said that fakir knew about the dangers of the heating unit but failed to follow through with a recall .
fakir has denied any responsibility for the disaster , citing a lack of conclusive evidence linking the heater to the blaze . more briefs 23.02.2004 -pipe- north koreans take refuge in german school in beijing 23.02.2004 -pipe- spd insists on fine to spur apprenticeships 23.02.2004 -pipe- two injured in hamburg bomb attack 23.02.2004 -pipe- schröder 's party losing members in droves 20.02.2004 -pipe- defense ministry denies contract allegations 20.02.2004 -pipe- ' anti-aging ' beer is not beer 19.02.2004 -pipe- americans forget iraq , love germany again 19.02.2004 -pipe- german police nab former spy courier at airport radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc support for eu falls in new commission poll only 48 percent of the 16,000 people questioned across the current eu-15 thought that their countries ' membership of the eu was " a good thing . "
this represents a decline of six percentage points when compared to the last survey carried out in spring 2003 .
there are extremely wide variations in the figures .
in luxembourg and ireland , 77 and 73 percent of people respectively think that the eu is a good thing .
at the other end of the scale , more british people believe the eu is bad -lrb- 29 percent -rrb- than good -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- .
however , despite this , europeans generally feel they have benefited from the eu .

this represents a decline of six percentage points when compared to the last survey carried out in spring 2003 .
there are extremely wide variations in the figures .
in luxembourg and ireland , 77 and 73 percent of people respectively think that the eu is a good thing .
at the other end of the scale , more british people believe the eu is bad -lrb- 29 percent -rrb- than good -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- .
however , despite this , europeans generally feel they have benefited from the eu .
of those surveyed , 46 percent said they had benefited , compared to 34 percent who had not .
again this was subject to wild swings .
in ireland - which has seen millions of euro of eu money flow into the country - 82 percent felt they had benefited compared to 8 percent who felt they had not .
again , in the uk , the result was reversed , with people saying that they had derived no benefit from the eu by 45-30 .
on the whole , people do not want the eu to be scrapped .
over one third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of people said they would feel " very sorry " if the union were to be disbanded .
exactly the same number said they would be indifferent and only 15 percent said they would be " relieved . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

the inauguration of the san juan subway in puerto rico , which was supposed to have been completed last year has been delayed several times , the last time being the end of 2003 .
now , the puerto rican transportation ministry is demanding a contractual penalty of 9 million dollars from siemens for the delay .
in 1996 , the puerto rican transport authority had awarded consortium siemens transit team the subway contract worth 1.8 billion deutschmarks -lrb- 900 million euro -rrb- .
the contract had been the biggest single assignment at the time for the siemens traffic technology division . more briefs 24.02.2004 -pipe- german business confidence sinks 23.02.2004 -pipe- german chemical firms sued for french bee deaths 23.02.2004 -pipe- t-mobile to introduce umts service in march 23.02.2004 -pipe- mobile phone merger loses steam 20.02.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler not giving up on truck toll 20.02.2004 -pipe- basf to compensate u.s. farmers 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.02.2004 germany supports turkey 's eu membership bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder enjoys a warm welcome from turkish leader tayyip erdogan .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .
" one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet .

19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first commercial levitation train leaving shanghai 's pudong international airport for a trial run to shanghai city 's new pudong financial district in china , dec .
19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .
" americans are still going to buy their bmws and think they 're great . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

overall pessimism , a change of party leadership in germany 's ruling social democratic party and the high euro exchange rate caused the index to sink from 97.5 to 96.4 points , according to experts .
ifo president hans werner-sinn called the news a small " warning shot " for the german economy and urged the government to continue with economic and labor market reforms designed to spark the country 's economy . more briefs 23.02.2004 -pipe- german chemical firms sued for french bee deaths 23.02.2004 -pipe- t-mobile to introduce umts service in march 23.02.2004 -pipe- mobile phone merger loses steam 20.02.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler not giving up on truck toll 20.02.2004 -pipe- basf to compensate u.s. farmers 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit 19.02.2004 -pipe- german travel company buys english airport radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet .

the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first commercial levitation train leaving shanghai 's pudong international airport for a trial run to shanghai city 's new pudong financial district in china , dec .
19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .

the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first commercial levitation train leaving shanghai 's pudong international airport for a trial run to shanghai city 's new pudong financial district in china , dec .
19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .

" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .

a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .

they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .

on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .

it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first commercial levitation train leaving shanghai 's pudong international airport for a trial run to shanghai city 's new pudong financial district in china , dec .
19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .
" americans are still going to buy their bmws and think they 're great . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .

a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .
all three are now connected via a digital video line .
but after the recent cuts in germany 's health care system , free computer scans to emergency patients from east of the border are something the radiologists in zittau wo n't be able to offer any longer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , on his first official visit to ankara , has promised strong support for turkey 's push to join the eu .
a decision on turkey 's candidacy is expected before the end of the year . chancellor schröder has given turkey 's eu enthusiasts reason to hope .
a statement of support from the largest nation in the eu bloc is crucial if turkey is to get the go-ahead to begin negotiations for eu membership .
" i believe turkey is on the right path with its reform process , " schröder said at a joint news conference with turkey 's prime minister , tayyip erdogan .
he said that erdogan 's political and human rights reforms should help turkey get a positive assessment from the european commission when it publishes an annual progress report in october .
eu officials will decide in december if they 'll give turkey the green light to become a candidate for eu entry .
overcoming rejection in october 2002 , the eu rejected turkey 's requests to set a date for the beginning of entry talks , mainly over concerns about turkey 's human rights record .
there were also reports that some senior eu officials had raised doubts that turkey could ever join the bloc .
due its geographical position straddling the boundary between europe and asia , turkey has historically been a melting pot of both cultures .
but the debate at the eu level belies a general unease at the idea of admitting a large muslim nation into the fold .
germany , though , has tended not to see turkey 's muslim culture as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government says turkey 's inclusion would be a unique chance to create more dialogue with the islamic world .
despite the snub it received in 2002 , turkey has not relented in its drive to join the eu .
erdogan has declared eu membership to be his government 's most important goal .
the turkish parliament has adopted several reform packages aimed at allievating the eu 's concerns , and bringing turkey 's laws on issues such as minority rights and human rights up to eu standards .
schröder said that the reform process - which has seen the death penalty abolished and greater rights granted to the country 's kurdish minority - has taken turkey " a large step " closer to europe , but he added that a resolution of the cyprus question before the first round of eu expansion on may 1 would be " an additional positive signal . "
greek and turkish cypriots have begun negotiations which could lead to reunification of the divided mediterranean island following referendums in both communities .
turkish cypriots are reported to be in favor of reunification , though there are reports now of increased opposition to the plan by greek cypriots .
buoyed by schröder 's visit - the first trip to ankara by a german chancellor in 11 years - erdogan stressed that turkey would do its utmost to keep the reform process moving .
in his opinion , the country has tackled the biggest issues standing in its path toward eu acceptance , though he said two or three important laws still needed to be implemented .
these include the start of of radio and television broadcasts in kurdish .
opposition less welcoming schröder 's show of support for turkey during his visit contrasted greatly with the more reserved comments made by german opposition leader angela merkel during her visit to ankara last week .
she proposed a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of eu membership .
merkel argued that the eu , which takes on 10 new member countries in may , will not be able to successfully integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that amounts to only 23 percent of the eu average .
erdogan dismissed the idea of a special partnership , saying that it had never been mentioned before and that he did n't plan on considering it .
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 , under which eu membership has always been held out as a possibility .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said .

german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .
i am glad that i could keep the faith in products " made in germany " . - m. joevalan vaz , coimbatore , tamil nadu , india send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .
all three are now connected via a digital video line .
but after the recent cuts in germany 's health care system , free computer scans to emergency patients from east of the border are something the radiologists in zittau wo n't be able to offer any longer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .

they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

eastern europe has too many doctors , eastern germany needs more of them .
that 's why german hospitals near poland and the czech republic have started recruiting medical staff from the other side of the border . on may 1 , the leaders of the czech republic , germany and poland will meet near the eastern german town of zittau to celebrate the expansion of the european union .
hospitals in the region have already started to look east across the border to deal with an acute shortage of doctors . in zittau 's regional hospital , administrators have long learned to spell the names of their new colleagues correctly .
agata magdziarek is one of the names that has started to appear frequently on the work schedule . the 28-year-old assistant doctor from lodz in poland came to germany because she could n't find a job in her home town , where many doctors are unemployed .
" i wanted to work in a hospital with high standards , " she said .
" it was impossible to find that in lodz . " finding no germans to do the job like magdziarek , many eastern european doctors are coming to germany to work with patients .
but before polish and czech doctors can come work in germany , authorities check whether there are germans available to do the job .
as a result , it took six months before the hospital received permission to offer the job to magdziarek . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square and city hall in zittau " young german doctors do n't want to come here , " said gerald gerlach , a radiologist at the hospital , where every sixth doctor now comes from poland or the czech republic .
" without these colleagues , we would not be able to staff shifts adequately , " gerlach said . eastern european doctors earn as much as their german counterparts - more than three times as much as they would at home .
they also have the opportunity to receive further training to become specialists . according to magdziarek , german patients have no reservations receiving treatment from her .
" i was worried about that , but it did n't happen , " she said . medical cooperation across the border besides the border-crossing doctors , hospitals in this region have cooperated in other ways for several years .
in 1997 , a woman hurt in a motorcycle accident was driven from bogatynia poland to zittau for a computer scan .
hospitals also exchange diagnostic findings and arrange for consultations with specialists . a czech hospital in liberec has joined the group .
all three are now connected via a digital video line .
but after the recent cuts in germany 's health care system , free computer scans to emergency patients from east of the border are something the radiologists in zittau wo n't be able to offer any longer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch . the label " made in germany " has come to mean quality , reliable goods in much of the world , especially in electronic and automobile technology .
but after the collapse of an ambitious , advanced road toll system along with several other high-profile technological failures , the sterling reputation of the " made in germany " name is being called into question , particularly among the german public . " can our engineers no longer manage to get anything right , " was the headline in bild , germany 's most widely read newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trucks drive under a scanner set up by toll collect .
the doubts began in earnest after the road toll system for heavy trucks , developed by a corsortium of two giants of german industry , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telecom , along with a french partner , turned into an expensive fiasco . the satellite-driven system was supposed to go into operation last august , but has been plagued with technical glitches and the start date has been repeatedly delayed .
toll collect now says the system could be partially operational by december 31 , 2004 and only fully up and running a year later , all at an estimated cost of € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- in lost revenue for the government . " this damages our image , and it 's a setback for innovation , " transport minister manfred stolpe said . rash of high-profile snafus toll collect is only one of several high-tech failures that the german media has been loudly bemoaning . " our cars are behind the japanese in mid-range quality rankings , " according to bild , " the mars probe , developed with german know-how , disappeared , leaving no trace on the red planet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first commercial levitation train leaving shanghai 's pudong international airport for a trial run to shanghai city 's new pudong financial district in china , dec .
19 , 2002 .
the transrapid -lrb- photo -rrb- , a magnetic levitation train meant to showcase german technological prowess , is operating only on a trial basis in germany and in china , where it has been beset by problems . a planned electronic card for the 72 million enrolled in germany 's public health insurance funds threatens to turn into another toll collect-sized debacle .
experts are saying its introduction will likely have to be pushed back a year and a half from its planned 2006 launch date . " it 's very damaging to the reputation of german technology .
it communicates to people that german industry is simply incapable , " siegried brandt , berlin chairman of the german engineering federation vdi , told dw-world . " that 's not really the case , though , " he added .
he says german technology itself is less the problem than the management or financing of big technology projects . " but the public does n't understand that and they think -lsb- our engineers -rsb- ca n't do it anymore . , " he said .
" that could have serious economic consequences . " one of those consequences is the missed chance to export new technological systems to other countries .
it was hoped that the high-tech road toll system would one day replace several older existing models in other countries .
instead , it has turned into an expensive international embarrassment . bildunterschrift : norbert walter " foreigners are now " joking that the germans , who do everything so systematically and precisely , were unable to make the toll system work , " norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank , told the newspaper die welt . others are quick to defend germany 's technological know-how , in spite of the latest failures .
they dismiss the forecasts of impending industrial doom making their way through the german media . " these are the kinds of mishaps that can happen anywhere , " henrike vieregge of the federation of german industry told dw-world .
" they have n't dragged the ' made in germany ' label through the dirt .
those words still stand for quality and reliability for a good price . " keep a good thing a proposal by the european union 's executive commission to replace " made in germany " with an eu-wide " made in europe " slogan had germans balking .
a large majority , 68 percent , rejected the suggestion .
only 5 percent thought the europe label was preferable . outside of germany , according to a survey in january , the made in germany label still has clout .
german-made goods are perceived as being among the most reliable products in the u.s. , japan , the u.k. and elsewhere in europe , according to a survey by edelman public relations worldwide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the u.s. , 52 percent of consumers have a " positive " view of products made in germany as do 60 percent of european consumers , the survey found .
" despite the recent set-backs , i do n't think the slogan has been affected as much as the media tells us , " kai konrad , professor at berlin 's free university , told dw-world , saying each country still had its strengths and should play on them .
" i like to buy my laptops in the u.s. , " he said .

after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

" made in germany " means to me a seal of quality and reliability , " a " for a good product at an affordable price .
but with the recent fiascos of the germans in technology -lrb- the mars probe , toll collect , deutsche bahn , etc . -rrb- my point of view is going to change . - jorge anicama the label " made in germany " matters a lot to me , as i always prefer to buy german brands . - nayyar ahmed , pakistan the " made in germany " label still carries a lot of clout around here .
i have tried out the transrapid system in shanghai and that was fast , so fast , i had trouble believing that i was at the airport in seven and a half minutes .
is there some way of lowering the costs to enable the realization of the beijing-shanghai maglev railway ? - gyamilobsang i still believe that german goods are among the best in the world .
my problem is that i do n't have money anymore to buy them ! - dejan sajinovic , bosnia made in germany means quite a lot to me .
i look for high quality and items made by free people earning reasonable wages .
most of us in the free world have enough to be able to support others .
in fact , most of us buy things we do n't need , so getting better quality and supporting decent working conditions is a pleasure as well as an investment in the future for our and other people 's children competition on wages rather than education or innovation does few any good .
for me " made in germany " is a label of quality and decency .
in fact , i chose a saab -lrb- 25 % made in germany -rrb- rather than a vw -lrb- made in mexico -rrb- , and i am happy to drive it . - harrison picot , haymarket , virginia , usa germany still has the best technology with reliability and more sustainability than its counterparts , like japan and upcoming south korea .
however what germans fail in is better marketing .
japan and now south korea have done better to push their technology .
germans needs to be a bit more competitive ; pride does n't get you anywhere . - vincent on i think many of my fellow americans would agree that the words " made in germany " signify excellent design and craftsmanship .
today one only needs to look to german manufactured automobiles to find superior innovation and quality , rated among the best in the world .
thus , germans have little to worry about their reputation in the area of engineering .
however , finance is an entirely different story , and for better or worse , as germany has seen all before , it is absolutely pointless to develop even the best technology without utility planning and proper financing . - eric h. west , usa " made in germany " has a lot of meaning to me .
when i see " made in germany " i think of quality in manufacture as well as design .
i only purchase german autos for these reasons as well as for safety . - albert greuter made in germany means to me top quality , whether i think of cars , medical equipment , electrical appliances or big industrial products .
i lived in germany almost 10 years and , as a latin american , can compare german and other quality .
german products are indeed the best . - mylena vega , costa rica bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in germany : the leica m7 the reputation that german-made products enjoy the world over has developed over many years , and as such will hardly disappear soon .
i note then within your article , a current production leica camera is used , presumably as a totem of german quality / engineering .
that this particular type of " obsolete " camera still sells , many years after the initial design , merely proves how durable that reputation of german products is . - stephen ascherl of course there are exceptions to everything .
but , i still interpret " made in germany " as a signal of high quality .
also , i know that products made in germany are made with a relatively high responsibility for the environment and workers . - george gruenewald , new mexico , usa telefunken radios were manufactured in india , and i am one of those thousands who purchased the radio .
i bought the radio because i was sure of the quality .
i still have the radio with me -lrb- since the last thirty-odd years -rrb- but not in good working condition .
i still value german made products .
so , when my son in united states volunteered to buy me a shortwave radio , we were initially confused with his suggestions of sony and other brands .
i came across a web site which sold radios and the advertisement compared the product with grundig .
i stopped at that and immediately opened the web site that was selling grundig radios .
the next e-mail was to my daughter-in-law to buy a grundig as my new shortwave world band radio .
however , i now learn that grundig is being manufactured in china .
but my son has assured me that the product is extremely good , because it is german-engineered .
i am glad that i could keep the faith in products " made in germany " . - m. joevalan vaz , coimbatore , tamil nadu , india send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german reader response -pipe- 24.02.2004 should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called " ausverkauf " in german dw-world asked readers whether they think germany should stop using the many english words that have crept into advertising , business and everyday speech . the german language is n't disappearing .
on the other hand , i think all languages , including english , are becoming international .
the smaller the world becomes , through television , movies , internet and air travel , the more all of us will find it necessary to speak a common language .
adding words from other languages adds flavor , variety , interest and diversity to a language .
it also brings understanding and celebration of other cultures . - ronda summers , usa i think " denglish " is bad for both languages .
the use of english catch phrases and slang ignores the perfectly good words and phrases available in german , and allows the advertisers and politicians to diffuse the meanings of words so that they gain control or avoid accountability .
it also frustrates those who do speak english well , because the denglish words do not mean the same as they would in proper english , which again leads to confusion in meaning and frustration in communications . - teresa j s drag perhaps you should take the democratic way out and have the people vote on it in the next national elections .
ca n't wait to see the translations for " big mac " and " whopper . " - herzilein york , usa i really do n't think that it should matter that much whether or not germans are speaking more english .
maybe it 's good for them .
english is quite possibly one of the most-used languages .
perhaps it 's natural that germans are speaking more english - or denglish , i should say .
english came from german , and spanish , french and italian came from latin .
so what 's the big deal ? - chance wilson , brooksville , florida , usa as a native english speaker who is currently learning german , i find it irritating and nauseating that many germans slavishly try to ape the english-speaking world , instead of appreciating and contributing to their own language and culture .
i have no desire to live in a world where we are all the same , linguistically and culturally , and feel that the germans have a tremendous amount to offer , but only if they stop apologizing for being german and start being proud of the fact . - joseph mcbride , nottingham , uk c 'mon , be real , get hip , english is the lingua franca of the world today .
limit it 's use and you have penalized the young people who are preparing to become part of today 's world .
besides , hearing english spoken by native german speakers which is being taught in a clear british english is like so charming .
-lrb- yes , claudia schiffer ; nein , arnold schwarzeneggar -rrb- - i. mandell demand from the coca-colas and wal-marts of the world to respect the german language .
it is amazing what a few letters to a corporate head can do to change their minds .
instead of demanding an end to denglish , make german trendy and hip . - kai abelkis , usa i think the constant use of english in german advertising is insipid but not likely to cease .
although , as you mentioned in your article , fewer people than expected really speak and understand english , put on any channel on the radio or tv and we are bombarded with denglish .
no matter what " noble " efforts are being taken to preserve the language , it is n't going to happen .
mixing languages is seen as cool ; the majority of hit songs are in english ; clothing is full of english messages and labels ; and we can not regulate that .
globalization will require us all to understand each other by speaking a simple , clearer business english .
i support my child speaking denglish , if only for the pronunciation practice : i am not foolish enough to believe that she can succeed in the future by isolating herself linguistically from the rest of the world .
i think there is a danger in that thinking .
so let 's make sure the english used is being used correctly , and see that our educators , when they do teach german , teach it correctly and update their skills as the language changes , so that our kids have a chance to be truly bilingual , and not semi-lingual , speaking neither language correctly . - christina albert few germans -lrb- who -rrb- mix english terminology with their german conversation - often to demonstrate " trendyness " - actually understand the english words they are using .
it also gives many germans the false impression that they speak better english than they actually do .
by all means , use a loan word when a suitable term does n't exist , but if a good german word exists why not use it , so everybody knows what you 're talking about ! - julie zein , uk , currently living in germany i think it is really good for a country to use its native language in almost anything or everywhere ; it is a way of showing national pride .
language serves as a sort of identity .
i strongly agree that germans should stop using english words . - monica hidalgo , philippines , currently living in germany your folksongs will keep the pure german going . - donald campbell , uk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight .

german chancellor gerhard schröder visits malta on tuesday .
the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may - some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world . on a recent morning in a small bar in malta , parking attendant luciano sipped on his cappuccino while chatting to the owner . at his place of work , a nearby hotel , luciano speaks english .
but when he 's hanging out with his countrymen , he prefers to converse in maltese .
it 's the language of his ancestors , the language of his everyday life , the language he dreams in .
" i feel so proud when i speak maltese , " he said .
" not even the americans have their own language .
they speak english . " a vanishing language ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street scene in malta today , about 392,000 people live in malta , and about 1.5 million emigrants worldwide still speak maltese .
for them , the language has become a symbol of cultural identification .
but while maltese brings together those living in new york or cologne , it 's losing its appeal in the home land . with malta joining the eu in may , many argue that english is the only language people need to be able to speak .
middle class parents now use the colonial language with their children at home and send them to expensive english-speaking private schools and british universities .
more and more , maltese is become just another foreign language taught in school . but some , such as oliver friggieri , a maltese poet and literature professor , say maltese is irreplaceable as a mother language .
friggieri himself also teaches in english , but he 's convinced that his countrymen wo n't give up maltese completely : the language is changing more than any other in europe , according to him .
" it will probably end up as a completely new language that 's half maltese and half english , " friggieri said . a linguistic curiosity while even linguists do n't know exactly when maltese originally emerged , the language probably has its roots in phoenician , one of the language spoken around the mediterranean in ancient times .
mirroring malta 's eventful history , maltese is quite similar to arabic and written in the latin alphabet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boats in the town of marsaxlokk the oldest inscriptions found on the group of three islands are phoenician and date back more than two and a half millennia .
in 870 , the arabs conquered malta , influencing maltese pronunciation , grammar and vocabulary in the coming centuries .
when the catholic order of the knights of st. john of jerusalem took over in 1530 , italian became the predominant language . almost 300 years later , in 1814 , malta changed hands again and the islands became a british colony with english as the official language .
while the maltese upper class continued to use italian , maltese eventually took over .
the colonial masters supported this development and introduced the latin alphabet on the island . orthography rules were established in 1924 and a decade later , maltese becomes the colony 's second official language and remained that after independence in 1964 .
italian lost its importance , but is still spoken on the islands to this day : italian television - needless to say without subtitles - remains popular among maltese . bringing cultures together treasuring the maltese roots is not only the linguists ' responsibility , the professor said - politicians , teachers and journalists also have to do their part .
according to friggieri , maltese , which uses the word " alla " for god , could open up completely new possibilities for a dialogue between cultures . # b # not everyone on the island is willing to accept this , though : suffering great losses , the arch-catholic islands , where abortion is still illegal , defied the turkish sultan in the 16th century , " saving europe from an islamic invasion , " as historians put it at the time . but friggieri still believes his mother language could help bridge the divide between europe and the arab world .
" maltese is the only semitic language written in the latin alphabet , " he said .
" this combination is something unique that malta has to offer .

experts say a drop in oxygen levels combined with overcrowding can lead to feelings of anxiety and aggression .
entitled ' a breath of fresh air underground ' , the report by transport specialists fereday pollard , calls for immediate improvements to ventilation .
but lu has dismissed the report saying it was based on " old research and supposition " .
metronet , which looks after maintenance on parts of the network , has commissioned an engineering consultancy to oversee refurbishment of 150 stations in the next eight years .
but the report said upgrades did not include plans for improvement to ventilation and comfort below ground .
a reduction in the level of oxygen in an enclosed space leads to increasing feelings of panic mike fisher , british association of anger management ben fereday , of fereday pollard , said : " not building for better ventilation now is a mistake as clean air in public spaces is becoming an increasingly important issue in society - just look at the moves to ban smoking in public places . "
mike fisher , director of the british association of anger management , said : " a reduction in the level of oxygen in an enclosed space leads to increasing feelings of panic .
" if on top of this you have the physical distress and discomfort of overcrowding , an individual can experience reactions such as anxiety , aggression , impatience and feelings of sickness . "
but a spokesman for lu said the company was examining ways of improving ventilation .
he added : " this report is based on old research and supposition .
" an independent report by the institute of occupational medicine in edinburgh in september 2003 concluded that it is very unlikely that tunnel dust on the underground has any serious adverse affect on the health of tube passengers and staff . "
the fereday pollard report adds that the tube carries three million passengers a day , accounting for 37.5 % of all journeys across london 's transport network .

but union and business leaders have welcomed plans to start a registration scheme for migrants who get jobs .
the government said its approach would open the door to much-needed workers while protecting the benefits system .
the conservatives said the scheme did not go far enough while the liberal democrats said was an over-reaction .
on monday home secretary david blunkett announced that people from the new eu states would not need work permits but would need to be on a work register .
labour shortages migrants without work would be banned from most benefits for at least two years but those working could take some welfare payments immediately .
later tony blair told a bbc radio phone-in : " if they ca n't support themselves , they will be put out of the country . "

sir ian plays the good wizard gandalf in the return of the king , the final part of director peter jackson 's trilogy , which is tipped to sweep the board at the oscars on 29 february .
he first appeared with his staff and trailing beard in the fellowship of the ring in 2001 , followed by the two towers a year later .
" i think i thought that gandalf was over as far as i was concerned in december 2000 , " sir ian told the bbc 's hardtalk programme .
" -lrb- yet -rrb- i still have n't finished .
i 'm doing some added dialogue for extended dvd of the return of the king .
" even if that is the last of me pretending to be gandalf , there will be a lot of people who think that i am gandalf and will probably bump into me during the rest of my life . "
sir ian said he normally preferred playing villains , but the rings films based on jrr tolkien 's books were a " remarkable " exception .
" the fellowship are all good people , and all doing their best , and that tolkien was able to make them all differentiated and attractive and intriguing is a mark of what a good writer he is and probably explains the success of the films , " he said .
sir ian , a classically-trained actor , said acting for audiences running into millions was in some ways similar to playing to a handful of people on stage .
" it 's just another wonderful experience of being an actor , " he told tom brook on bbc world 's hardtalk .
" like playing macbeth in a very small theatre with judi dench nearly 30 years ago in stratford on avon .
that felt the height of achievement for me as an actor .
nobody saw it . "
the audience come up in the streets at the premieres and shriek and go bananas " sir ian mckellen " here i am at the opposite end of the scale .
the difference is with macbeth i actually saw the audience .
i looked them in the eye .
just 100 of them , easy to do .
" you never meet your audience normally when you are in a film .
in this case i have met quite a lot of them because they come up in the streets at the premieres and shriek and go bananas . "
speaking of his hopes for the return of the king , he praised director jackson and singled out actors andy serkis , who plays gollum , and elijah wood -lrb- frodo -rrb- .
he took an affectionate swipe at jackson 's dress sense , saying : " peter 's sartorial tastes are limited .
it 's about the only area in his life where his imagination lets him down a bit .
" he 's got two shirts and they are both identical .
he 's a man who very much lives in his body but he 's got a huge head , and inside it what is most impressive about him is his huge imagination . "

sir ian plays the good wizard gandalf in the return of the king , the final part of director peter jackson 's trilogy , which is tipped to sweep the board at the oscars on 29 february .
he first appeared with his staff and trailing beard in the fellowship of the ring in 2001 , followed by the two towers a year later .
" i think i thought that gandalf was over as far as i was concerned in december 2000 , " sir ian told the bbc 's hardtalk programme .
" -lrb- yet -rrb- i still have n't finished .
i 'm doing some added dialogue for extended dvd of the return of the king .
" even if that is the last of me pretending to be gandalf , there will be a lot of people who think that i am gandalf and will probably bump into me during the rest of my life . "
sir ian trained as an actor in repertory theatre sir ian said he normally preferred playing villains , but the rings films based on jrr tolkien 's books were a " remarkable " exception .
" the fellowship are all good people , and all doing their best , and that tolkien was able to make them all differentiated and attractive and intriguing is a mark of what a good writer he is and probably explains the success of the films , " he said .
sir ian , a classically-trained actor , said acting for audiences running into millions was in some ways similar to playing to a handful of people on stage .
" it 's just another wonderful experience of being an actor , " he told tom brook on bbc world 's hardtalk .
" like playing macbeth in a very small theatre with judi dench nearly 30 years ago in stratford on avon .
that felt the height of achievement for me as an actor .
nobody saw it .
the audience come up in the streets at the premieres and shriek and go bananas sir ian mckellen " here i am at the opposite end of the scale .
the difference is with macbeth i actually saw the audience .
i looked them in the eye .
just 100 of them , easy to do .
" you never meet your audience normally when you are in a film .
in this case i have met quite a lot of them because they come up in the streets at the premieres and shriek and go bananas . "
speaking of his hopes for the return of the king , he praised director jackson and singled out actors andy serkis , who plays gollum , and elijah wood -lrb- frodo -rrb- .
he took an affectionate swipe at jackson 's dress sense , saying : " peter 's sartorial tastes are limited .
it 's about the only area in his life where his imagination lets him down a bit .
" he 's got two shirts and they are both identical .
he 's a man who very much lives in his body but he 's got a huge head , and inside it what is most impressive about him is his huge imagination . "

fatima mukhadirova , 62 , is the mother of a man who died in prison , allegedly after he was immersed in boiling water and otherwise tortured .
she was jailed for six years earlier this month for " undermining the constitution " .
but the court has now reduced the penalty to a fine of about $ 250 .
the court said mrs mukhadirova 's age and gender lay behind the decision .
but the release seemed timed to coincide with mr rumsfeld 's visit .
he arrived in the capital tashkent for talks with president islam karimov about the continued us military presence in the country .
taking into account the fact that she is a woman , as well as her old age , the court decided to mitigate the punishment and free her with a fine alisher ergashev , lawyer uzbekistan has been a close ally of the united states since the attacks of 11 september , and served as the launch-pad for us attacks on afghanistan .
rights groups had called on mr rumsfeld to bring up human rights issues during the talks .
mrs mukhadirova was first arrested after she drew attention to her son 's death .
she was accused of distributing extremist literature - that is , pamphlets propagating an islamic state .
but human rights groups say her real offence was to raise questions about the death of her son muzafar .
he was convicted of belonging to an illegal religious group and died in prison last year .
human rights groups have said that he was immersed in boiling water , but the government maintains that he had heart disease and died after a fight with cell mates who threw scalding tea at him .
photographs of the body appeared to show that his fingernails had been removed .

fatima mukhadirova , 62 , is the mother of a man who died in prison , allegedly after he was immersed in boiling water and otherwise tortured .
she was jailed for six years earlier this month for " undermining the constitution " .
but the court has now reduced the penalty to a fine of about $ 250 .
the court said mrs mukhadirova 's age and gender lay behind the decision .
but the release seemed timed to coincide with mr rumsfeld 's visit .
he arrived in the capital tashkent for talks with president islam karimov about the continued us military presence in the country .
taking into account the fact that she is a woman , as well as her old age , the court decided to mitigate the punishment and free her with a fine alisher ergashev , lawyer uzbekistan has been a close ally of the united states since the attacks of 11 september , and served as the launch-pad for us attacks on afghanistan .
rights groups had called on mr rumsfeld to bring up human rights issues during the talks .
mrs mukhadirova was first arrested after she drew attention to her son 's death .
she was accused of distributing extremist literature - that is , pamphlets propagating an islamic state .
but human rights groups say her real offence was to raise questions about the death of her son muzafar .
he was convicted of belonging to an illegal religious group and died in prison last year .

mrs longhurst , 72 , called for the sites to be banned after coutts was jailed for life at lewes crown court earlier this month .
