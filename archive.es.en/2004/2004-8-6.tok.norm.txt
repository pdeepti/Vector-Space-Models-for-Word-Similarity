white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .

the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .

the study shows that young men consequently have reduced chances of finding work and are more likely to find themselves unemployed .
researchers believe the findings indicate that the current education system is inadequately tailored to germany 's young male population .
nonetheless , successful female school leavers should n't rest on their laurels .
gesis , the german social science infrastructure services , has produced a report concluding that within the world of academia , women are enjoying professional success at a personal cost , only having children in their late thirties or not at all . more briefs 06.08.2004 -pipe- ex-east german officials convicted for wall shootings 06.08.2004 -pipe- " hanse sail " brings tall ships to rostock 06.08.2004 -pipe- heatwave puts forests , fish at risk 06.08.2004 -pipe- greenpeace christens new action ship 06.08.2004 -pipe- many sick after pool chlorine accident 05.08.2004 -pipe- nurse suspected of killing 80 patients 05.08.2004 -pipe- more germans have unprotected sex , report says 05.08.2004 -pipe- germans send troops to secure afghan election radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in what is likely to be the last case of its kind , a court in berlin found the men guilty on three counts of accessory to murder .
hans-joachim böhme , 74 , and 73-year-old siegfried lorenz were members of the east german politburo .
the court said they had failed to use their influence to end the communist regime 's shoot-to-kill policy for people who illegally tried to cross the border .
judges found them partly responsible for the deaths of three men shot dead by border guards at the berlin wall in the late 1980s .
the men had been cleared of the same charges in the year 2000 but a higher court overturned the not-guilty verdict and ordered a retrial . more briefs 06.08.2004 -pipe- " hanse sail " brings tall ships to rostock 06.08.2004 -pipe- heatwave puts forests , fish at risk 06.08.2004 -pipe- greenpeace christens new action ship 06.08.2004 -pipe- many sick after pool chlorine accident 05.08.2004 -pipe- nurse suspected of killing 80 patients 05.08.2004 -pipe- more germans have unprotected sex , report says 05.08.2004 -pipe- germans send troops to secure afghan election 05.08.2004 -pipe- german-polish mig-29 transfer complete radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite a one-hour delay , werder was still able to beat schalke 1-0 . only four minutes before the match was to begin , construction not far from werder bremen 's stadium caused a major power outage plunging 43,000 fans into darkness .
after an hour delay it looked like the first match of the new season was going to be postponed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one hour after the the german bundesliga soccer match between werder bremen and fc schalke should begin it 's dark in the weserstadium in bremen , northern germany .
supporters from both bremen and schalke 04 began to get restless , but fortunately power was restored and things got underway .
it was perhaps a strange matchup in the first place , since two players that helped win werder the title last season , mladen krstajic and star brazilian striker ailton , were wearing schalke blue after switching teams . the evening was billed as a duel between ailton and his five-million-euro replacement , german international miroslav klose .
however , both were ineffective in the first half .
ailton almost broke clear in the 32nd minute but a lofted through pass hit him on the back allowing the bremen rearguard to regroup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's braziliann soccer player ailton jumps for the ball during the german first soccer division match between sv werder bremen and fc schalke 04 in bremen 's weserstadium .
four minutes before half-time bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke appeared to forget that ailton was no longer a werder player racing out of his goal - when there appeared little danger - allowing ailton to pick up the ball by the touchline .
but last season 's top bundesliga scorer drifted a lob wide of the post to spare reinke 's blushes . the other former bremen man krstajic had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the second half but his final touch let him down as reinke whipped the ball off his toe in the penalty area . but despite schalke 's pressure it was bremen who took the spoils with paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez reacting to a knockdown from frenchman valerien ismael in the 83th minute to poke home .
valdez had only been on the field nine minutes after replacing bremen debutant klose . lineups : bremen : 1 reinke - 3 pasanen , 25 ismael , 2 fahrenhorst , 7 stalteri - 24 borowski , 6 baumann , 4 ernst - 10 micoud - 11 klose , 17 klasnic schalke : 1 rost - 18 oude kamphuis , 15 waldoch , 20 krstajic , 24 pander - 2 poulsen , 6 altintop , 17 vermant , 3 kobiaschwili - 9 ailton , 26 hanke referee : trautmann attendance : 43,000 -lrb- sold out -rrb- dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 germany calling , from 30,000 feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't pack that - you 'll want it on the plane cell phone emissions may not be as bad for on-board electronics as regulators once thought , according to lufthansa officials , who conducted tests on the issue .
but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !
background noises that can be played during cell phone conversations could provide the alibi you need miss the flight .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !
background noises that can be played during cell phone conversations could provide the alibi you need miss the flight .

despite a one-hour delay , werder was still able to beat schalke 1-0 . only four minutes before the match was to begin , construction not far from werder bremen 's stadium caused a major power outage plunging 43,000 fans into darkness .
after an hour delay it looked like the first match of the new season was going to be postponed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one hour after the the german bundesliga soccer match between werder bremen and fc schalke should begin it 's dark in the weserstadium in bremen , northern germany .
supporters from both bremen and schalke 04 began to get restless , but fortunately power was restored and things got underway .
it was perhaps a strange matchup in the first place , since two players that helped win werder the title last season , mladen krstajic and star brazilian striker ailton , were wearing schalke blue after switching teams . the evening was billed as a duel between ailton and his five-million-euro replacement , german international miroslav klose .
however , both were ineffective in the first half .
ailton almost broke clear in the 32nd minute but a lofted through pass hit him on the back allowing the bremen rearguard to regroup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's braziliann soccer player ailton jumps for the ball during the german first soccer division match between sv werder bremen and fc schalke 04 in bremen 's weserstadium .
four minutes before half-time bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke appeared to forget that ailton was no longer a werder player racing out of his goal - when there appeared little danger - allowing ailton to pick up the ball by the touchline .
but last season 's top bundesliga scorer drifted a lob wide of the post to spare reinke 's blushes . the other former bremen man krstajic had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the second half but his final touch let him down as reinke whipped the ball off his toe in the penalty area . but despite schalke 's pressure it was bremen who took the spoils with paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez reacting to a knockdown from frenchman valerien ismael in the 83th minute to poke home .
valdez had only been on the field nine minutes after replacing bremen debutant klose . lineups : bremen : 1 reinke - 3 pasanen , 25 ismael , 2 fahrenhorst , 7 stalteri - 24 borowski , 6 baumann , 4 ernst - 10 micoud - 11 klose , 17 klasnic schalke : 1 rost - 18 oude kamphuis , 15 waldoch , 20 krstajic , 24 pander - 2 poulsen , 6 altintop , 17 vermant , 3 kobiaschwili - 9 ailton , 26 hanke referee : trautmann attendance : 43,000 -lrb- sold out -rrb- dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !
background noises that can be played during cell phone conversations could provide the alibi you need miss the flight .

" the party leadership rejects the slanderous defamation contained in this letter , " spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a statement .
" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .
he added that this latest criticism came from embittered party members who were unable to win support at party congresses that backed schröder . " someone who has failed to get their point across at party meetings should not try to act as a troublemaker and defame the work of the government and the party .
they set themselves outside our community , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german leftist group emerges unhappy with the german government 's welfare reforms , trade union and social democratic party members have formed a new association that could pose a serious challenge in upcoming elections .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .

in what is likely to be the last case of its kind , a court in berlin found the men guilty on three counts of accessory to murder .

" the party leadership rejects the slanderous defamation contained in this letter , " spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a statement .
" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .

" the party leadership rejects the slanderous defamation contained in this letter , " spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a statement .
" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .
he added that this latest criticism came from embittered party members who were unable to win support at party congresses that backed schröder .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is known as the city of laptops and lederhosen , because so many computer and software companies are based in the bavarian capital .
in the meantime , munich 's mayor has called on interested parties including officials in the bavarian cities of augsburg and nuremberg , as well as vienna , austria - all cities considering a switch to open-source computing - to try to influence their governments and eu bodies not to allow the eu commission 's draft become law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .

after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .

the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .
he added that this latest criticism came from embittered party members who were unable to win support at party congresses that backed schröder .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

beer frenzy in munich visit germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 summertime is beer garden time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what the café is to the french , the beer garden is to the germans as soon as the weather allows it , germans head to beer gardens to partake of their favorite brew and a pretzel or wurst in the shadow of chestnut trees . when the mercury starts to rise in the spring , it 's just a matter of time until the beer gardens open their doors to the crowds of germans looking forward to enjoying a drink under the blazing sun . beer gardens have been a feature of german life ever since the brief reign of bavarian king ludwig i -lrb- 1825-1848 -rrb- , who inadvertently caused their establishment after decreeing that beer could only be brewed during the winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guests have an afternoon drink at munich 's central viktualienmarkt beer garden .
here 's the reaon why : even then southern germans were keen on drinking beer prevalent in germany today , which is brewed with barley malt and requires temperatures between 4 and 9 degrees celsius -lrb- 39 to 48 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- to ferment .
since refrigeration was n't possible , the beer could n't be brewed during the warmer seasons . providing beer to the masses but the bavarians wanted to drink barley malt beer - which includes pilsner - in summer , too .
thus , industrious brewers dug up to 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- deep caves along the river slopes outside munich , where they left beer to ferment in barrels covered with ice culled from the rivers and lakes during the winter . they covered the cellars with light-colored gravel and planted shadowy chestnut or linden trees to protect them from the sun 's heat .
in summer , the brewers served the fresh beer on these sites , drawing crowds of thirsty people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when munich 's smaller breweries saw how well business was going beyond the city 's gates , they took legal action in protest . king ludwig was sympathetic to their cause : although he allowed the cellars to continue selling beer , he forbade them from serving snacks .
guests ended up satisfying their hunger by bringing their own food , a tradition that continues today . beer gardens have long invaded the city as well : no place in germany has more , older or bigger open air restaurants than munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 germany calling , from 30,000 feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't pack that - you 'll want it on the plane cell phone emissions may not be as bad for on-board electronics as regulators once thought , according to lufthansa officials , who conducted tests on the issue .
but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 newspaper : berlin paid ransom to free hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists were held captive in north africa for nearly half a year germany paid ransom to free european tourists taken hostage last year in algeria 's sahara desert , the leader of the islamic group responsible reportedly told a french magazine in an interview . amari saifi , a leader of the algerian islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- that is thought to have ties to al qaeda , told paris match magazine on thursday that his group had received ransom payments to release the 32 mainly german hostages they had kidnapped last year . although it has long been suspected that germany paid around € 5 million -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- to have the hostages freed , there had been no confirmation of any payment .
in berlin , the foreign ministry refused comment .
" the german government 's fundamental position refusing to pay out ransom is well known , " a spokesman told news agency afp . questioned about the exact sum paid , saifi told paris match : " we made a promise to the german government not to divulge the amount . "
he added that " most was spent buying supplies for our brothers in algeria .
we also bought weapons and ammunition . " saifi - who is also known as abderrezak " the para " for his time as a paratrooper in the algerian army - led the gspc group that kidnapped 32 european tourists in separate incidents in february and march 2003 as the visitors crossed the sahara .
he is currently being held captive in northern chad by the rebel movement for democracy and justice in chad -lrb- mdjt -rrb- . seventeen of the tourists - 10 austrians , six germans and a swede - were freed in may 2003 during an assault by the algerian army .

" the party leadership rejects the slanderous defamation contained in this letter , " spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a statement .
" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .
he added that this latest criticism came from embittered party members who were unable to win support at party congresses that backed schröder .

" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .

she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is known as the city of laptops and lederhosen , because so many computer and software companies are based in the bavarian capital .
in the meantime , munich 's mayor has called on interested parties including officials in the bavarian cities of augsburg and nuremberg , as well as vienna , austria - all cities considering a switch to open-source computing - to try to influence their governments and eu bodies not to allow the eu commission 's draft become law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .

despite a one-hour delay , werder was still able to beat schalke 1-0 . only four minutes before the match was to begin , construction not far from werder bremen 's stadium caused a major power outage plunging 43,000 fans into darkness .
after an hour delay it looked like the first match of the new season was going to be postponed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one hour after the the german bundesliga soccer match between werder bremen and fc schalke should begin it 's dark in the weserstadium in bremen , northern germany .
supporters from both bremen and schalke 04 began to get restless , but fortunately power was restored and things got underway .
it was perhaps a strange matchup in the first place , since two players that helped win werder the title last season , mladen krstajic and star brazilian striker ailton , were wearing schalke blue after switching teams . the evening was billed as a duel between ailton and his five-million-euro replacement , german international miroslav klose .
however , both were ineffective in the first half .

valdez had only been on the field nine minutes after replacing bremen debutant klose . lineups : bremen : 1 reinke - 3 pasanen , 25 ismael , 2 fahrenhorst , 7 stalteri - 24 borowski , 6 baumann , 4 ernst - 10 micoud - 11 klose , 17 klasnic schalke : 1 rost - 18 oude kamphuis , 15 waldoch , 20 krstajic , 24 pander - 2 poulsen , 6 altintop , 17 vermant , 3 kobiaschwili - 9 ailton , 26 hanke referee : trautmann attendance : 43,000 -lrb- sold out -rrb- dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 munich puts linux migration on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting on ice : tux , the linux penguin logo munich caught the attention of the it world last year when the city decided to move from microsoft windows to the open-source operating system linux .
but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 munich puts linux migration on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting on ice : tux , the linux penguin logo munich caught the attention of the it world last year when the city decided to move from microsoft windows to the open-source operating system linux .
but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .

it 's the unit 's first mission outside of europe . created in 1992 , eurocorps , a french-german initiative that 's also backed by belgium , spain and luxembourg , is scheduled to replace canadian soldiers in leading the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan for the next six months . they will coordinate peacekeeping operations , overseeing about 7,000 nato troops from 30 countries currently stationed in afghanistan .
isaf was set up by the united nations in 2001 , shortly after the fall of the taliban regime . french general jean-louis py , who will serve as commander , said eurocorps troops would be in place by the end of august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 germany calling , from 30,000 feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't pack that - you 'll want it on the plane cell phone emissions may not be as bad for on-board electronics as regulators once thought , according to lufthansa officials , who conducted tests on the issue .
but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .

mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

despite a one-hour delay , werder was still able to beat schalke 1-0 . only four minutes before the match was to begin , construction not far from werder bremen 's stadium caused a major power outage plunging 43,000 fans into darkness .
after an hour delay it looked like the first match of the new season was going to be postponed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one hour after the the german bundesliga soccer match between werder bremen and fc schalke should begin it 's dark in the weserstadium in bremen , northern germany .
supporters from both bremen and schalke 04 began to get restless , but fortunately power was restored and things got underway .
it was perhaps a strange matchup in the first place , since two players that helped win werder the title last season , mladen krstajic and star brazilian striker ailton , were wearing schalke blue after switching teams . the evening was billed as a duel between ailton and his five-million-euro replacement , german international miroslav klose .
however , both were ineffective in the first half .
ailton almost broke clear in the 32nd minute but a lofted through pass hit him on the back allowing the bremen rearguard to regroup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's braziliann soccer player ailton jumps for the ball during the german first soccer division match between sv werder bremen and fc schalke 04 in bremen 's weserstadium .
four minutes before half-time bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke appeared to forget that ailton was no longer a werder player racing out of his goal - when there appeared little danger - allowing ailton to pick up the ball by the touchline .
but last season 's top bundesliga scorer drifted a lob wide of the post to spare reinke 's blushes . the other former bremen man krstajic had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the second half but his final touch let him down as reinke whipped the ball off his toe in the penalty area . but despite schalke 's pressure it was bremen who took the spoils with paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez reacting to a knockdown from frenchman valerien ismael in the 83th minute to poke home .
valdez had only been on the field nine minutes after replacing bremen debutant klose . lineups : bremen : 1 reinke - 3 pasanen , 25 ismael , 2 fahrenhorst , 7 stalteri - 24 borowski , 6 baumann , 4 ernst - 10 micoud - 11 klose , 17 klasnic schalke : 1 rost - 18 oude kamphuis , 15 waldoch , 20 krstajic , 24 pander - 2 poulsen , 6 altintop , 17 vermant , 3 kobiaschwili - 9 ailton , 26 hanke referee : trautmann attendance : 43,000 -lrb- sold out -rrb- dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2004 germany calling , from 30,000 feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't pack that - you 'll want it on the plane cell phone emissions may not be as bad for on-board electronics as regulators once thought , according to lufthansa officials , who conducted tests on the issue .
but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

in berlin , the foreign ministry refused comment .
" the german government 's fundamental position refusing to pay out ransom is well known , " a spokesman told news agency afp . questioned about the exact sum paid , saifi told paris match : " we made a promise to the german government not to divulge the amount . "
he added that " most was spent buying supplies for our brothers in algeria .
we also bought weapons and ammunition . " saifi - who is also known as abderrezak " the para " for his time as a paratrooper in the algerian army - led the gspc group that kidnapped 32 european tourists in separate incidents in february and march 2003 as the visitors crossed the sahara .
he is currently being held captive in northern chad by the rebel movement for democracy and justice in chad -lrb- mdjt -rrb- . seventeen of the tourists - 10 austrians , six germans and a swede - were freed in may 2003 during an assault by the algerian army .
three months later , nine germans , four swiss and a dutchman were released in mali following negotiations between the gspc and the german government .
one other hostage , a german woman , died while in captivity . germany issued an international arrest warrant last september for saifi over the kidnappings . the mdjt said in mid-march this year that they had captured saifi and other gspc members .
it has since repeatedly expressed willingness to turn saifi over to algeria , which wants to put him on trial . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed sahara hostage : " life will return to normal " kidnappers held reto walther and 13 other tourists hostage for over five months in the sahara desert until late august .

in berlin , the foreign ministry refused comment .
" the german government 's fundamental position refusing to pay out ransom is well known , " a spokesman told news agency afp . questioned about the exact sum paid , saifi told paris match : " we made a promise to the german government not to divulge the amount . "
he added that " most was spent buying supplies for our brothers in algeria .
we also bought weapons and ammunition . " saifi - who is also known as abderrezak " the para " for his time as a paratrooper in the algerian army - led the gspc group that kidnapped 32 european tourists in separate incidents in february and march 2003 as the visitors crossed the sahara .
he is currently being held captive in northern chad by the rebel movement for democracy and justice in chad -lrb- mdjt -rrb- . seventeen of the tourists - 10 austrians , six germans and a swede - were freed in may 2003 during an assault by the algerian army .
three months later , nine germans , four swiss and a dutchman were released in mali following negotiations between the gspc and the german government .
one other hostage , a german woman , died while in captivity . germany issued an international arrest warrant last september for saifi over the kidnappings . the mdjt said in mid-march this year that they had captured saifi and other gspc members .
it has since repeatedly expressed willingness to turn saifi over to algeria , which wants to put him on trial . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed sahara hostage : " life will return to normal " kidnappers held reto walther and 13 other tourists hostage for over five months in the sahara desert until late august .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal .
-lrb- august 29 , 2003 -rrb- government says sahara hostages shouldn ’ t profit from ordeal the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state .
-lrb- august 24 , 2003 -rrb- sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is known as the city of laptops and lederhosen , because so many computer and software companies are based in the bavarian capital .
in the meantime , munich 's mayor has called on interested parties including officials in the bavarian cities of augsburg and nuremberg , as well as vienna , austria - all cities considering a switch to open-source computing - to try to influence their governments and eu bodies not to allow the eu commission 's draft become law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .

european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.08.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc munich re increases net profit munich re , the world 's largest re-insurer , reported a sharp increase in second-quarter net profit friday as more careful underwriting and a lack of major accidents and disasters helped earnings .
net profit increased to € 625 million -lrb- $ 754 million -rrb- from € 28 million in the april-june period last year , the company said .

here 's the reaon why : even then southern germans were keen on drinking beer prevalent in germany today , which is brewed with barley malt and requires temperatures between 4 and 9 degrees celsius -lrb- 39 to 48 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- to ferment .
since refrigeration was n't possible , the beer could n't be brewed during the warmer seasons . providing beer to the masses but the bavarians wanted to drink barley malt beer - which includes pilsner - in summer , too .
thus , industrious brewers dug up to 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- deep caves along the river slopes outside munich , where they left beer to ferment in barrels covered with ice culled from the rivers and lakes during the winter . they covered the cellars with light-colored gravel and planted shadowy chestnut or linden trees to protect them from the sun 's heat .
in summer , the brewers served the fresh beer on these sites , drawing crowds of thirsty people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when munich 's smaller breweries saw how well business was going beyond the city 's gates , they took legal action in protest . king ludwig was sympathetic to their cause : although he allowed the cellars to continue selling beer , he forbade them from serving snacks .
guests ended up satisfying their hunger by bringing their own food , a tradition that continues today . beer gardens have long invaded the city as well : no place in germany has more , older or bigger open air restaurants than munich .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is known as the city of laptops and lederhosen , because so many computer and software companies are based in the bavarian capital .
in the meantime , munich 's mayor has called on interested parties including officials in the bavarian cities of augsburg and nuremberg , as well as vienna , austria - all cities considering a switch to open-source computing - to try to influence their governments and eu bodies not to allow the eu commission 's draft become law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .

despite a one-hour delay , werder was still able to beat schalke 1-0 . only four minutes before the match was to begin , construction not far from werder bremen 's stadium caused a major power outage plunging 43,000 fans into darkness .
after an hour delay it looked like the first match of the new season was going to be postponed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one hour after the the german bundesliga soccer match between werder bremen and fc schalke should begin it 's dark in the weserstadium in bremen , northern germany .
supporters from both bremen and schalke 04 began to get restless , but fortunately power was restored and things got underway .
it was perhaps a strange matchup in the first place , since two players that helped win werder the title last season , mladen krstajic and star brazilian striker ailton , were wearing schalke blue after switching teams . the evening was billed as a duel between ailton and his five-million-euro replacement , german international miroslav klose .
however , both were ineffective in the first half .
ailton almost broke clear in the 32nd minute but a lofted through pass hit him on the back allowing the bremen rearguard to regroup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's braziliann soccer player ailton jumps for the ball during the german first soccer division match between sv werder bremen and fc schalke 04 in bremen 's weserstadium .
four minutes before half-time bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke appeared to forget that ailton was no longer a werder player racing out of his goal - when there appeared little danger - allowing ailton to pick up the ball by the touchline .
but last season 's top bundesliga scorer drifted a lob wide of the post to spare reinke 's blushes . the other former bremen man krstajic had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the second half but his final touch let him down as reinke whipped the ball off his toe in the penalty area . but despite schalke 's pressure it was bremen who took the spoils with paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez reacting to a knockdown from frenchman valerien ismael in the 83th minute to poke home .
valdez had only been on the field nine minutes after replacing bremen debutant klose . lineups : bremen : 1 reinke - 3 pasanen , 25 ismael , 2 fahrenhorst , 7 stalteri - 24 borowski , 6 baumann , 4 ernst - 10 micoud - 11 klose , 17 klasnic schalke : 1 rost - 18 oude kamphuis , 15 waldoch , 20 krstajic , 24 pander - 2 poulsen , 6 altintop , 17 vermant , 3 kobiaschwili - 9 ailton , 26 hanke referee : trautmann attendance : 43,000 -lrb- sold out -rrb- dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

" the party leadership rejects the slanderous defamation contained in this letter , " spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a statement .
" the paper is disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter the letter called for a u-turn on schröder 's package of welfare and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder has to go - whether he wants to or not , " the letter read , appealing to party members to sign up to an initiative to replace the chancellor . it also accused schröder of breaking with the mandate from his 2002 re-election campaign , and said the party leadership had allowed itself to become isolated from grassroots members . the only contact person mentioned in the letter was the cologne-based spd member eva gürster .
she was not available for comment . according to cologne party members , the letter first made an appearance at the beginning of july , but failed to make an impact . unpopular reform policies schröder has come under increasing pressure to ease the pace of reforms that leftists within the spd have criticized for being socially unjust .
schröder has repeatedly insisted that he will push forward with the unpopular measures , a decision benneter defended in the wake of the letter . " these policies are demanding , but step by step , they 're taking us in the right direction , " benneter said .
he added that this latest criticism came from embittered party members who were unable to win support at party congresses that backed schröder . " someone who has failed to get their point across at party meetings should not try to act as a troublemaker and defame the work of the government and the party .

but eu patent rules have forced the city to rethink its plan . concerns expressed by munich city officials mean that munich 's switch to the linux operating system - planned for this summer - have to be put on ice .
city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .
if that happens , munich 's plans for linux could be sent back to the drawing board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee in munich 's city hall navigates the web sit of the linux operating system .
the city is n't giving up on its quest to become one of germany 's first communal governments to use open-source software on its 14,000 computers .
mayor christian ude of the social democrats emphasized that the city still plans to switch to linux .
and wilhelm hoegner , munich 's chief information officer , said the program would only be temporarily shelved while the city analyzed the legal and financial risks associated with the program .
mixed messages from berlin florian müller , a consultant for mysql , europe 's biggest open-source manufacturer , told german news agency dpa that he blames the federal government for munich 's problems getting linux onto its computers .
berlin is sending mixed signals , he said , and should respond more strongly to munich 's postponement .
" the interior ministry has recommended all public offices switch to linux , but the justice ministry is making the whole thing look like a bad decision , which in the end could cost billions of euros , " müller said .
german justice minister brigitte zypries and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein have both endorsed the eu directive , arguing that it would not obstruct advancements in open-source technology but would act as a reward for innovation and development .
the eu competition commission said the patents would create a common european position and update the european patent convention to handle technology developed after it was originally drafted in the beginning of the 1970s .
businesses oppose patents that opinion is not shared by many in the business world .
small companies feel shut out by the proposed eu rules , since protecting patents from infringement can be a budget-breaking endeavor .
enactment could ultimately threaten the existence of freelance software developers , and small and medium-sized businesses , chaos computer club spokesman andy müller-maguhn said in a recent interview with stern magazine .
deutsche bank research , the kiel institute of world economics and the federal association of small and middle sized businesses have also spoken out against software patents , according to müller-maguhn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is known as the city of laptops and lederhosen , because so many computer and software companies are based in the bavarian capital .
in the meantime , munich 's mayor has called on interested parties including officials in the bavarian cities of augsburg and nuremberg , as well as vienna , austria - all cities considering a switch to open-source computing - to try to influence their governments and eu bodies not to allow the eu commission 's draft become law . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .
the service is currently only available on flights between munich and los angeles , and munich and tokyo , but lamberty said lufthansa plans to outfit all its long-distance planes with broadband connections by the summer of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

in berlin , the foreign ministry refused comment .
" the german government 's fundamental position refusing to pay out ransom is well known , " a spokesman told news agency afp . questioned about the exact sum paid , saifi told paris match : " we made a promise to the german government not to divulge the amount . "
he added that " most was spent buying supplies for our brothers in algeria .
we also bought weapons and ammunition . " saifi - who is also known as abderrezak " the para " for his time as a paratrooper in the algerian army - led the gspc group that kidnapped 32 european tourists in separate incidents in february and march 2003 as the visitors crossed the sahara .
he is currently being held captive in northern chad by the rebel movement for democracy and justice in chad -lrb- mdjt -rrb- . seventeen of the tourists - 10 austrians , six germans and a swede - were freed in may 2003 during an assault by the algerian army .
three months later , nine germans , four swiss and a dutchman were released in mali following negotiations between the gspc and the german government .
one other hostage , a german woman , died while in captivity . germany issued an international arrest warrant last september for saifi over the kidnappings . the mdjt said in mid-march this year that they had captured saifi and other gspc members .
it has since repeatedly expressed willingness to turn saifi over to algeria , which wants to put him on trial . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed sahara hostage : " life will return to normal " kidnappers held reto walther and 13 other tourists hostage for over five months in the sahara desert until late august .

white house national security advisor condoleezza rice warned that the iranian government would be isolated if it fails to comply with measures to ensure full disclosure and transparency of its nuclear activities .
" iran is going to be confronted , " rice told the us broadcaster fox news .
she said that a " very tough set of resolutions " demanding iranian cooperation would be ready for consideration in september , when the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- next meets to discuss iran 's nuclear program . the warnings came two days after iran said it had resumed building nuclear centrifuges , which the us says are intended to make weapons-grade enriched uranium for use in bombs .
no progress in paris last week , diplomats from the european union 's " big three " - germany , france and britain - held talks in paris with iranian officials about the country 's nuclear program , and stressed their wish to see a halt to iran 's work on the centrifuges .
the talks produced " no substantial progress . "
iran denies that it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb , and says the centrifuges are being used to meet increasing demand for electricity .
the us wants to refer iran to the un security council and impose economic sanctions .
but asked whether europe would go along with us plans to increase pressure on iran , rice said washington would " just have to keep working with the french , the british and the germans to make certain " they follow the us position .
european diplomats have kept quiet on how they intend to proceed .
while there 's little doubt that european negotiators were frustrated by the lack of progress at last week 's talks , europe has been committed to a process of engagement with iran , which the eu says has been developing in a " positive direction . "
according to reports in the iranian media , european diplomats in tehran said they will continue engagement and communication , though there was mention of a " cooling off period , " referring to the pause in negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement between brussels and tehran . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

city alderman jens mühlhaus , a supporter of open source , warned that the linux project could infringe on as many as 50 pending patents were software developers to pursue possible claims .
germany is one of the countries behind a propsed european union directive on software patents .
the eu commission for competition has now paved the way for patents to be filed on open source computer systems , though its proposals still need to be approved by the european parliament before they become law .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .
other in-flight options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on the defunct concorde would probably have liked to use cell phones the dlr is also heading up an international project for the european commission called wireless cabin .
along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .
he added that he believes the technology will be ready for use in about two years .
but lufthansa passengers wo n't be completely out of touch for the next two years .
last may , the company introduced flynet , which gives passengers a broad-band , wireless internet connection .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .
the phones are n't officially approved for in-flight use but they are usually " tolerated , " according to michael lamberty , a lufthansa spokesman .

along with airbus , ericsson , italy 's telecommunicationi , siemens , the university of bradford , and several other companies , the german aeronautic team aims to use satellites to relay information to and from a communications system installed on planes and a base station that distributes the data on the ground .
the plane 's on-board system would mean the " cell phones in the plane would emit noticeably less power , " erich lutz , head of dlr 's digital networks department , told the süddeutsche zeitung .

but government officials are not convinced . " i could n't call , i was on the plane , " wo n't be an excuse anymore if the results of recent research and future tests convince lawmakers to make airplanes cell-phone friendly .
earlier this week , lufthansa and the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced the test results showing that even using emissions 25 times stronger than regular cell phones caused " no complications " to plane systems .
but the findings are n't likely to be enough to persuade passengers to phone home - all the research has been carried out on the ground .
the first tests above the clouds are planned for the fall .
in any case , it 's not science forcing people to pack away the cell phone , but rather politics : the german transport ministry , for example , has n't been persuaded to change its federal aviation regulations based on the scientific evidence .
" we 're not yet convinced of the safety of cellular radio waves , " felix stenschke , a spokesman for the ministry , told reporters .
a jail sentence for talkers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even miles high in the sky your boss can still reach you .
as a precautionary measure , the german government introduced a law prohibiting the use of cell flights between boarding and disembarking .
anyone caught making a call on a plane while in flight faces steep penalties , including up to two years in jail .
other countries are n't so extreme .
passengers on the us carrier delta air lines can talk as long as the plane is docked to the airport , and united airlines even allows conversations on board before takeoff and after landing .
until aviation policy is changed , nokia and sony ericsson are the best choice for people who ca n't stand to be disconnected .
the two cell phone manufacturers have designed technology that allows the reception of incoming data , but not the sending of it .
thus a passenger could only answer a call coming from the ground , but not call people .

it 's the unit 's first mission outside of europe . created in 1992 , eurocorps , a french-german initiative that 's also backed by belgium , spain and luxembourg , is scheduled to replace canadian soldiers in leading the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan for the next six months . they will coordinate peacekeeping operations , overseeing about 7,000 nato troops from 30 countries currently stationed in afghanistan .
isaf was set up by the united nations in 2001 , shortly after the fall of the taliban regime . french general jean-louis py , who will serve as commander , said eurocorps troops would be in place by the end of august .

" this way we wo n't have to hit the ground running , but instead can enter the stage step by step .

germany has about 2,000 soldiers stationed there . " it is an extremely important step for eurocorps , which well shows the synergy with nato , " py said , describing himself as a " conductor " whose role was to " put to music " nato decisions , afp reported . while saying that the situation in afghanistan was relatively peaceful at the moment , py added things could change quickly .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?
when can we americans expect to come to the rescue after iran has nuclear weapons , like north korea .
north korea created their nuclear weapons right under the noses , literally , of the un inspectors .
shall we continue to travel down failed paths that led to more trouble ?
in fact , america will simply be glad to work with israel , iran 's first target , on missile defense to defend against nuclear missiles .
we will continue to fight the terrorists who have declared war on us .
then germany and france can lead the rest of the wimps of the world toward mutual destruction and we will reap the benefit of knowing that , at least , we tried to warn you all .
wake up germany , before it 's too late .
if it is n't already . - lee depue , united states should europe abandon its policy of engaging iran to comply with the us position of increased pressure and sanctions ?
no , it should not abandon it .
iran is not our enemy and a healthy eu-iran relationship is beneficial to all of us .
it will make the world safer , more prosperous , more stable .
just because the current us regime - which has been disgraced numerous times internationally - thinks iran is their enemy -lrb- and does not try the diplomatic course -rrb- is not reason to abandon an independent policy .
if anything , it is reason for europe to show it is an independent power and can have different policies than the us regime 's . - patrick wall by all means , europe , be more aggressive and take military action .
by the way , do you even have a military ?
then maybe -lrb- us filmmaker -rrb- michael moore will move to germany and start making derogatory films about your country and your leaders .
-lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer 's remarks have americans laughing so hard it hurts - and iran must be laughing even harder .
pretty good for the " america hater " to make threats he fully intends for his hated america to stand behind . - andrew f so , herr fischer , what are you actually going to do about it ?
perhaps 12 years ' worth of resolutions in the un could help dissuade them from developing nuclear weapons .
after all , iraq responded so well to them .
maybe you should not have sold them the technology to build them in the first place and left it up to us to clean up after you once again . - michael hofke , united states i think iran has the right to continue its nuclear program , and even if it 's developing a nuclear bomb you ca n't blame them , because the eu big three and the us have it too .
and since israel is threatening iran with its nuclear bomb , teheran would definitely be concerned .
the best thing to do is have bush and other countries get rid of their bombs first . - andy diplomacy will not resolve the problem .
europe does not want to admit that oil-rich iran is not interested in a peaceful nuclear program .
europe despises bush 's accurate assessment of iran , but they do not have the guts to admit it . - frank shipp the iranian nuclear program must be seen in the context of the nuclear misbalance in the middle east .
presently , israel is the only middle eastern nuclear power and a direct threat to iran .
the us armed forces also put pressure on iran from afghanistan and iraq .
under these circumstances it is natural that iran will feel reluctant to open up their program to the international community .
this is sad , but i think the problem of iran can not be solved as long as we do n't adequately address the nuclear capability of israel .
europeans should encourage the entire middle east region to become nuclear-free , and perhaps we should start at home with france and the uk . - atilla a iftikhar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp urged in an editorial that europe should continue using diplomacy to defuse the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
dw-world readers were divided over the issue . the problem lies with the so-called ' european diplomacy ' of france and germany .
war is an absolute last resort .
but in order for diplomacy to succeed , it should remain a viable option .
iraq was able to toy with the un for more than 12 years because its leaders never imagined coalition forces would set foot in baghdad .
the leaders of countries like iran were sent a clear message last year that lack of cooperation with un security council resolutions can result in their swift and decisive removal from power .
had countries like france and germany backed the coalition forces in the iraq war , iran would not be playing the nuclear games it plays today .
' european diplomacy ' has only succeeded in encouraging iran to disregard the international community 's concerns . - eric amat y leon , united states europe 's approach to iran is fitting , because the production of centrifuges does not necessarily suggest the building of nuclear bombs .
america 's aggressive " guilty till proven innocent attitude " does not encourage trust and honesty between countries , which in light of the instability in the middle east is something that needs to be fostered .
america has done an incredible amount of damage to relations in this region ; we certainly do not need to put iran off-side as well .
find the evidence then take action .
we do not need a repeat of the iraqi crisis .
good luck to germany , france and britain . - jo vagg , australia so , what now germany ?

the maritime and coastguard agency -lrb- mca -rrb- is offering wristbands to write phone numbers on so lost children can be reunited with their parents .
it comes after dover coastguard was called out to search for 45 children at camber sands , sussex , on 1 august .
coastguards around the uk co-ordinated 316 search and rescue operations on the first weekend in august .
' extremely distressing ' a sea smart survey , conducted by the mca , showed nearly one-fifth , or 18 % , of parents lost sight of their children while on the beach last year .
the waterproof wristbands being given out by the mca can be worn by children with a mobile number on so parents can be contacted .
the bands can be collected from tourist information centres , lifeguard stations and coastguard offices .

the bands can be collected from tourist information centres , lifeguard stations and coastguard offices .
john astbury , the uk 's chief coastguard , said : " when children go missing it can be extremely distressing for both parents and the children themselves and could have fatal consequences .
" the sea smart beach bands are a way of reuniting children with their parents as quickly as possible before a tragedy occurs . "

a press report said henrique meirelles had transferred funds from an undeclared bank account .
earlier reports accused him of tax evasion .
mr meirelles issued a strong denial of any wrongdoing .
but with brazil 's stock market falling after the allegations were published , opposition leaders say he should quit .
fighting for future the latest allegation concerns a transfer of $ 50,000 -lrb- £ 33,000 -rrb- in 2002 from an american bank account in the name of henrique meirelles to another us account operated by a firm of brazilian money dealers .
the news magazine veja says mr meirelles had n't declared his account with brazil 's tax authorities .
it also reports that the firm of dealers is now under investigation for money laundering .
once again mr meirelles has issued a strong denial .
a statement says he made proper tax declarations before and after moving back to brazil from the united states in 2002 .
it adds that mr meirelles has no knowledge of the firm of money dealers .
amid all this , brazil 's president is keen to hang on to the man he appointed but pressure on the governor is mounting .
the leader of the main opposition party has called on mr meirelles to resign immediately .
if he does n't , he will face detailed questioning about his finances by a parliamentary committee .
wherever the truth lies , the governor is now fighting for his future .
