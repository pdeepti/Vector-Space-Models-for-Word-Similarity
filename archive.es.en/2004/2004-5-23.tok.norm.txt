the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .
the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses . for germans wanting to get a message to their governing officials over the past few days , the post office was a more reliable messenger than e-mail . the unit charged with monitoring and filtering the emails of government ministeries , the ivbb , said friday that it had registered more than 510,000 unwanted e-mails in the past week .
employees reported that there was often a three-day lag on most of their e-mails . a spokesman for the interior ministry said that anti-virus software had picked up a virus and a high number of spam e-mails .
" we are not investigating what background this might have , or whether this is just a normal extra load of spam mails , " he said . roughly one in every two e-mails sent to the government is junk mail , according to the ivbb , and the number of viruses is growing .
while the percentage of virus-infected mails in 2003 was just 3 percent , the figure in early 2004 was closer to 10 percent . in may , 20 percent of the e-mails sent contained some sort of virus , according to the authorities . eu : not enough anti-virus protection european companies report similar problems .
many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
but that has n't been enough for the european union , which wants the country to pass a tougher anti-spam mail law the kind found in other european countries and the united states . the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of junk e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier in the year designed to punish those who send spam mail .

the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .
the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses . for germans wanting to get a message to their governing officials over the past few days , the post office was a more reliable messenger than e-mail . the unit charged with monitoring and filtering the emails of government ministeries , the ivbb , said friday that it had registered more than 510,000 unwanted e-mails in the past week .
employees reported that there was often a three-day lag on most of their e-mails . a spokesman for the interior ministry said that anti-virus software had picked up a virus and a high number of spam e-mails .
" we are not investigating what background this might have , or whether this is just a normal extra load of spam mails , " he said . roughly one in every two e-mails sent to the government is junk mail , according to the ivbb , and the number of viruses is growing .
while the percentage of virus-infected mails in 2003 was just 3 percent , the figure in early 2004 was closer to 10 percent . in may , 20 percent of the e-mails sent contained some sort of virus , according to the authorities . eu : not enough anti-virus protection european companies report similar problems .
many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
but that has n't been enough for the european union , which wants the country to pass a tougher anti-spam mail law the kind found in other european countries and the united states . the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of junk e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier in the year designed to punish those who send spam mail .
but the bill has n't gotten much attention so far in parliament . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses . for germans wanting to get a message to their governing officials over the past few days , the post office was a more reliable messenger than e-mail . the unit charged with monitoring and filtering the emails of government ministeries , the ivbb , said friday that it had registered more than 510,000 unwanted e-mails in the past week .
employees reported that there was often a three-day lag on most of their e-mails . a spokesman for the interior ministry said that anti-virus software had picked up a virus and a high number of spam e-mails .
" we are not investigating what background this might have , or whether this is just a normal extra load of spam mails , " he said . roughly one in every two e-mails sent to the government is junk mail , according to the ivbb , and the number of viruses is growing .

many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
but that has n't been enough for the european union , which wants the country to pass a tougher anti-spam mail law the kind found in other european countries and the united states . the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of junk e-mail .

the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .
the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses . for germans wanting to get a message to their governing officials over the past few days , the post office was a more reliable messenger than e-mail . the unit charged with monitoring and filtering the emails of government ministeries , the ivbb , said friday that it had registered more than 510,000 unwanted e-mails in the past week .
employees reported that there was often a three-day lag on most of their e-mails . a spokesman for the interior ministry said that anti-virus software had picked up a virus and a high number of spam e-mails .
" we are not investigating what background this might have , or whether this is just a normal extra load of spam mails , " he said . roughly one in every two e-mails sent to the government is junk mail , according to the ivbb , and the number of viruses is growing .
while the percentage of virus-infected mails in 2003 was just 3 percent , the figure in early 2004 was closer to 10 percent . in may , 20 percent of the e-mails sent contained some sort of virus , according to the authorities . eu : not enough anti-virus protection european companies report similar problems .
many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .

the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .
the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses . for germans wanting to get a message to their governing officials over the past few days , the post office was a more reliable messenger than e-mail . the unit charged with monitoring and filtering the emails of government ministeries , the ivbb , said friday that it had registered more than 510,000 unwanted e-mails in the past week .
employees reported that there was often a three-day lag on most of their e-mails . a spokesman for the interior ministry said that anti-virus software had picked up a virus and a high number of spam e-mails .
" we are not investigating what background this might have , or whether this is just a normal extra load of spam mails , " he said . roughly one in every two e-mails sent to the government is junk mail , according to the ivbb , and the number of viruses is growing .
while the percentage of virus-infected mails in 2003 was just 3 percent , the figure in early 2004 was closer to 10 percent . in may , 20 percent of the e-mails sent contained some sort of virus , according to the authorities . eu : not enough anti-virus protection european companies report similar problems .
many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
but that has n't been enough for the european union , which wants the country to pass a tougher anti-spam mail law the kind found in other european countries and the united states . the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of junk e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier in the year designed to punish those who send spam mail .
but the bill has n't gotten much attention so far in parliament . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

while the percentage of virus-infected mails in 2003 was just 3 percent , the figure in early 2004 was closer to 10 percent . in may , 20 percent of the e-mails sent contained some sort of virus , according to the authorities . eu : not enough anti-virus protection european companies report similar problems .
many do n't have adequate anti-virus protection software , according to a report by the software maker mcafee .
the company said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks . germany 's government sets aside around € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
but that has n't been enough for the european union , which wants the country to pass a tougher anti-spam mail law the kind found in other european countries and the united states . the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of junk e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier in the year designed to punish those who send spam mail .
but the bill has n't gotten much attention so far in parliament . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

one of the handful of surviving french participants in the landings , leon gautier lives in ouistreham - only a few hundred yards from the german pill-box which he stormed on 6 june 1944 .
leon gautier now lives on the beach he stormed mr gautier , who is now 81 , was a member of the so-called " kieffer commando " - a detachment of 177 frenchmen who formed part of lord lovat 's 1st special service brigade on d-day .
he remembers being embarked on 5 june at warsash on the solent , and a night of choppy weather in a landing craft containing about 90 men .
" when we got near to the coast the gun batteries opened up .
and then our commanding officer colonel -lrb- robert -rrb- dawson made his famous remark : ' messieurs les francais - tirez les premiers ! "
mr gautier recalls .
dawson 's words were a re-working from a well-known french quotation dating from 1745 when a french noblemen approached the english enemy at the battle of fontenoy and shouted " my english sirs - you may shoot first ! "
" so he let our barge go first on to the beaches , " mr gautier says .
" it was a very gallant gesture and we loved him for it . "
i remember running and firing my machine-gun , then we threw grenades into the pill-box leon gautier lord lovat 's task was to seize the eastern end of the normandy bridgehead , and the kieffer commando was sent against the port of ouistreham , where the strategically important caen canal enters the sea .
mr gautier charged up the beach to attack the german blockhouse , which still stands there today .
" as we came into land our other landing-craft was hit and all the officers in it were wounded , " he says .
" i remember running and firing my machine-gun , then we threw grenades into the pill-box .
i may have killed some germans , but i do n't know which ones .
and i do n't want to know . "
english love having secured the blockhouse mr gautier 's unit circled to the left behind ouistreham 's " casino " - a fortified german position - which was quickly taken , and that evening found him at pegasus bridge over the canal reinforcing the british airborne troops there .
thousands perished in the normandy landings " in the end it was much less hard than i had feared .
i had expected a lot tougher .
we lost 10 dead but it could have been worse , " he says .
" it was thanks to our discipline .
in the british army you had to be disciplined - which was something the french were not very good at . "
mr gautier had volunteered for the free french forces loyal to general charles de gaulle back in 1941 , and he had already seen action in africa and the middle east when in 1943 he was selected to join the elite british commandos .
it was around this time in dover that he met his english wife dorothy , who lives with him to this day at their villa in ouistreham .
" i was a young telephone engineer who was called out to put in a line at the commandos ' barracks in dover .
no-one answered so i started climbing in the window .
that was when i was nearly put under arrest by leon ! " she remembers now .
tired mr gautier was demobilised in august 1944 , returning to england to marry dorothy in october .
mr gautier met his wife dorothy in england during the war after a career as a car mechanic in england , france and africa , mr gautier settled in ouistreham 12 years ago - largely because of the constant demands on his time as head of the kieffer commando veterans ' association .
" we thought it would be better to be near the job , " he says .

the cameras are being tested in soho square in london in the uk there is one cctv camera for every 14 people .
if you are in london , you could be caught on camera up to 300 times a day .
but the cameras are expensive , and once you have installed one , and laid all the wires back to base , it is fixed and can not move .
this means if a crime hotspot moves round the corner , you can not see it .
westminster city council in london have come up with a solution - cctv cameras without wires , which broadcast their pictures back to base using the council 's new wireless network .
" the key advantage from a wi-fi network camera compared with a fixed camera system is purely the mobility , and being able to be flexible enough to deal with crimes in certain areas directly at the times that you need it , " said rob mcallister , of westminster city council .
mobile access the pilot scheme uses five discreet cameras to monitor people 's comings and goings in soho square .
wireless cctv cameras make it easier and easier for more and more cameras to be installed shani chakrabarti , liberty " within the square we have a network of wireless lan bridges providing blanket coverage throughout the square , " said tim hearn of cisco systems which is providing some of the technology .
" down the narrow streets , greek street and frith street , we have wi-fi pointing down those streets as well so they give us coverage down there .
" so that 's a network of wireless lan devices that we then plug into cctv cameras , we provide access to mobile workers that will have laptops of mobiles working with them , or maybe some specialist devices .
" we 're also linking into noise monitoring devices or other sensors , " he said .
privacy issues in the testing stages , the project is using wi-fi b technology , which is cheaper and slower , and limits the quality of the video stream .
eventually council employees will have access to council files and pictures on the move , pictures from cameras that can be moved to a new location cheaply and quickly .
the cameras could be easier moved to crime hotspots but along with the benefits of monitoring crime as it moves come concerns about just how easy it will be to watch who you want , where you want .
" clearly , wireless cctv cameras make it easier and easier for more and more cameras to be installed , " said shani chakrabarti of the civil liberties group , liberty .
" this is an indication of a wider problem with technology moving apace creating even more potential for interferences with personal privacy and the law not really catching up with the technology because we do n't have a comprehensive privacy law in this country , or resources or political will devoted to enforcing privacy protection . "
privacy laws may need constant revision to keep up with technology .
the current data protection act already demands that cameras do not intrude on private places , something which westminster 's software cleverly adheres to .
but one industry watcher believes one obstacle may be a fundamental technical one .
" the greatest concern that this system is going to face is one of interference , " said networking expert gordon laing .
" interference is an issue for all wireless networks simply because so many other things use the same frequencies - microwave ovens , bluetooth telephones , other wireless networks .
interference wo n't actually shut down a network altogether , but it will reduce the speed at which it operates and the range over which it operates . "
secure network security is also an issue .
the new wireless system involves pictures being transmitted over the air .
council employees will be able to watch footage whilst on the move , so could others do the same thing or hack into the network ?
" no system is 100 % perfect , so what we have to do , as technologists , is use all of the mechanisms that we know to be able to make the network secure using what we would say is strength in depth , " said cisco 's mr hearn .
" there 's not just one mechanism used to secure the network but there 's a multitude of techniques that we would use .
" security is about technology , but it 's also about process and quality , so there 's a human element to this as well , " he added .
" we 're very good at being able to provide the technology elements to it but the users and the organisation that 's using the network need to make sure that their policies and procedures are up to date to be able to cope with that . "
wireless westminster is in its infancy , but the eventual benefits are there for all to see .
you just have to make sure the security of the network is well managed .

the cameras could be easier moved to crime hotspots but along with the benefits of monitoring crime as it moves come concerns about just how easy it will be to watch who you want , where you want .
" clearly , wireless cctv cameras make it easier and easier for more and more cameras to be installed , " said shani chakrabarti of the civil liberties group , liberty .
" this is an indication of a wider problem with technology moving apace creating even more potential for interferences with personal privacy and the law not really catching up with the technology because we do n't have a comprehensive privacy law in this country , or resources or political will devoted to enforcing privacy protection . "
privacy laws may need constant revision to keep up with technology .
the current data protection act already demands that cameras do not intrude on private places , something which westminster 's software cleverly adheres to .
but one industry watcher believes one obstacle may be a fundamental technical one .
" the greatest concern that this system is going to face is one of interference , " said networking expert gordon laing .
" interference is an issue for all wireless networks simply because so many other things use the same frequencies - microwave ovens , bluetooth telephones , other wireless networks .
interference wo n't actually shut down a network altogether , but it will reduce the speed at which it operates and the range over which it operates . "
secure network security is also an issue .
the new wireless system involves pictures being transmitted over the air .
council employees will be able to watch footage whilst on the move , so could others do the same thing or hack into the network ?
" no system is 100 % perfect , so what we have to do , as technologists , is use all of the mechanisms that we know to be able to make the network secure using what we would say is strength in depth , " said cisco 's mr hearn .
" there 's not just one mechanism used to secure the network but there 's a multitude of techniques that we would use .
" security is about technology , but it 's also about process and quality , so there 's a human element to this as well , " he added .
" we 're very good at being able to provide the technology elements to it but the users and the organisation that 's using the network need to make sure that their policies and procedures are up to date to be able to cope with that . "
wireless westminster is in its infancy , but the eventual benefits are there for all to see .
you just have to make sure the security of the network is well managed .

the cameras are being tested in soho square in london in the uk there is one cctv camera for every 14 people .
if you are in london , you could be caught on camera up to 300 times a day .
but the cameras are expensive , and once you have installed one , and laid all the wires back to base , it is fixed and can not move .
this means if a crime hotspot moves round the corner , you can not see it .
westminster city council in london have come up with a solution - cctv cameras without wires , which broadcast their pictures back to base using the council 's new wireless network .
" the key advantage from a wi-fi network camera compared with a fixed camera system is purely the mobility , and being able to be flexible enough to deal with crimes in certain areas directly at the times that you need it , " said rob mcallister , of westminster city council .
mobile access the pilot scheme uses five discreet cameras to monitor people 's comings and goings in soho square .
wireless cctv cameras make it easier and easier for more and more cameras to be installed shani chakrabarti , liberty " within the square we have a network of wireless lan bridges providing blanket coverage throughout the square , " said tim hearn of cisco systems which is providing some of the technology .
" down the narrow streets , greek street and frith street , we have wi-fi pointing down those streets as well so they give us coverage down there .
" so that 's a network of wireless lan devices that we then plug into cctv cameras , we provide access to mobile workers that will have laptops of mobiles working with them , or maybe some specialist devices .
" we 're also linking into noise monitoring devices or other sensors , " he said .
privacy issues in the testing stages , the project is using wi-fi b technology , which is cheaper and slower , and limits the quality of the video stream .

the 84-mile stretch of wall linking tyneside to cumbria opened in may 2003 .
it is estimated that more than 3,500 people have walked its length from wallsend to bowness-on-solway since its launch .
the countryside agency , which is responsible for the trail , said 50 % of the £ 6m cost of setting up the route had already been recouped .
a spokesman for the countryside agency said the number of long distance walkers using the trail had been substantial .
one in five walkers was from overseas - with 50 % of those from north america .
' phenomenally successful ' he said latest figures show that in its first year , the trail had generated £ 3m to the local economies of cumbria and northumberland .
that figure does not include spending by around 250,000 people who used the trail as either day or short stay visitors .
a special " passport " , which walkers can have stamped at six locations along the route has been re-launched after being withdrawn for the winter .
but this year a winter passport will be on offer which will cover 20 of the 100 or so circular walks off the main trail .
a spokesman for regional development agency one northeast , which has recently taken over responsibility for tourism in the region , said : " the trail has widened the appeal of hadrian 's wall to a whole new audience and has been phenomenally successful .
" it has increased the number of people taking in its unique visitor experience and has been a major economic boost to the rural communities and businesses along the length of the wall . "

that figure does not include spending by around 250,000 people who used the trail as either day or short stay visitors .
a special " passport " , which walkers can have stamped at six locations along the route has been re-launched after being withdrawn for the winter .

a spokesman for regional development agency one northeast , which has recently taken over responsibility for tourism in the region , said : " the trail has widened the appeal of hadrian 's wall to a whole new audience and has been phenomenally successful .
" it has increased the number of people taking in its unique visitor experience and has been a major economic boost to the rural communities and businesses along the length of the wall . "

philippe busquin , the eu 's research commissioner , told gathered experts the volume of europe 's fusion research would double from 2007 to 2013 .
fusion powers stars and is seen as a cleaner approach to energy production than nuclear fission and fossil fuels .
mr busquin was speaking at a 25th anniversary event at the jet -lrb- joint european torus -rrb- fusion centre .
the jet project is one of the world 's leading fusion research facilities , and holds the record for fusion energy production .
based at culham in oxfordshire , it is a collaboration between all european fusion organisations , and involves technology and physics research from the global scientific and engineering community .
prime minister tony blair sent a message of support for the achievements of the project , which could lead to a substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity .
at the anniversary celebrations , mr busquin reaffirmed jet 's position as the main driver in the progress towards eventually producing commercially viable , clean , safe and cheap energy .
summer decision ?
but the decision on whether the iter project -lrb- international thermonuclear experimental reactor -rrb- is built at rokkasho-mura in japan , or cadarache in france , has been delayed several times .
iter would be more than double the size of the facility at jet , and would aim to generate 500 megawatts of fusion power for 500 seconds or longer .
in a special message , mr blair said he " hoped to see the siting issue resolved in the next few months " .
mr busquin told bbc news online that his hope was that the decision would be made quickly , before the end of the summer .
crucial to the decision is the plan for a broader approach to the iter project and the technological support involved , which includes the location of further research sites and data centres .
this includes the location of the international fusion material irradiation facility -lrb- ifmif -rrb- , which would help develop materials for fusion production .
he also reiterated the importance of gaining full european support for iter .
the jet machine is a massive machine at a recent european ministerial meeting , the plans to adopt a broader approach to the iter project were given to ministers .
mr busquin said that both japan and europe had recognised the plans , which would mean that the site not chosen to be the location of iter would still have a crucial technological role in the project as a whole .
behind the scenes , there has been much political manoeuvring , and the decision is said to be as much about wider geopolitical concerns as technical issues .
the european union , russia and china want france to win ; but south korea , the united states and tokyo are backing japan .
in some quarters , it is felt the us objects to the french option because of its position on the war in iraq .
star power after the international space station , iter would be the largest international research and development collaboration .
in terms of the physics and huge amounts of energy involved , the project would be akin to building a star on earth .
it would be the first fusion device to produce thermal energy at the level of conventional electricity-producing power stations , and would pave the way for the first prototype commercial power station .
in a fusion reaction , energy is produced when light atoms - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atoms .
to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun .
the technical requirements to do this , which jet has been working on for more than two decades , are immense .
but the rewards , if it can be made to work at a commercial level , are extremely attractive .
one kilogram of fusion fuel would produce the same amount of energy as 10,000,000 kg of fossil fuel .

tintagel castle was built in the 13th century by richard the earl of cornwall .
its remains consist of steep stone steps , stout walls and rugged cliff edges which encircle the great hall where the earl once feasted .
but there are so many unanswered questions and legends surrounding the town .
even before the castle was built , tintagel had come to be associated with the conception of king arthur .

officers said they were pleased with the low number of arrests , which were made as up to 100,000 people visited the city to see manchester united take on millwall .
most arrests were for suspected ticket touting , though six were for minor public order offences , and one was made when a fan ran onto the pitch .
south wales police said a lot of officers remained into the evening as many fans stayed on after the game .
there had been some concerns about trouble between rival fans .
but chief superintendent jeff cooksley said : " there were a few minor flash points throughout the day that had the potential to create disorder , but the professionalism of the officers combined with a tried-and-tested policing plan ensured that no violence occurred . "
he commended the behaviour of both sets of fans .
fans young and old travelled miles or the match extra-tight safety measures had been put in place - not only because of concerns of clashes between opposing fans , but also because of fears of a terrorist attack .
police said there was no specific threat , but armed officers posted at key spots on the outskirts of the city had been carrying out random checks on incoming lorries since midweek .
assistant chief constable stephen cahill said : " there was no specific intelligence on this event , but there is a worldwide risk .
" we are not linking it directly to events at manchester united .
sadly , because of what happened in madrid , events worldwide and what happened at manchester united , we have to take the risk at major events seriously . "
around 1,000 officers were working in and around the stadium .
many were brought in from other parts of south wales , and from london and manchester .
inside the ground , an additional 180 stewards - from the home grounds of manchester and millwall - were helping with crowd control , and bags were searched and x-rayed for illegal objects .
hotels and guest houses have been booked up for weeks , and businesses in the city were extremely busy , with pubs drafting in additional staff and ordering extra supplies .
the fa cup final has come to cardiff four times some shops and restaurants , however , clearly thought the fans might be more than they could cope with , as some were displaying " closed for the fa cup " signs .
the rise in visitor numbers has not just had a knock-on effects for the economy of the welsh capital city .
accommodation as far afield as swansea , 40 miles away , has been booked out for the match weekend .
the millennium stadium was filled to its 72,500 capacity , with an extra 30,000 fans packing the pubs in the city to watch the game on tv .
inside the stadium , 90 volunteers from st john ambulance in wales provided first aid support .
this is the fourth year cardiff has hosted the event , because the final 's former home , wembley stadium , is being re-developed .
