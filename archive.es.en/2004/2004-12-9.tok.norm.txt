nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.12.2004 the hunt for east german money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr marks were dumped , but hard currency is still missing thursday marks the first international anti-corruption day .
more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .

prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .

it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .

help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .

the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "

" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .

they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2004 powell re-buffed by nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he believes the friendship between the us and europe still exists us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .
nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

" the mszp -lrb- socialist party -rrb- is working on a bill that would allow free access to the national security documents housed in the historical archives , " party president istvan hiller told a news conference .
" the unfortunate and fruitless disputes must come to an end , " added the party 's new leader , in reference to leaks to the press implicating everyone from politicians to footballers of collaborating with the secret service .
" we can only plan safely for the future if we face the past and have closure , " he said . the socialist party , which counts among its ranks many former communists , had been against divulging the files from the cold war era when spying on each other was commonplace .
its coalition partner , the free democrats , - with many ex-dissident members - was for opening them .
the bill foresees making available dossiers of the communist security apparatus which contain secrets on collaborators with the espionage , counter-espionage and the domestic intelligence services , socialist parliamentarian sandor burany said . high ranking officials had spy posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter medgyessy hungary was hit by a scandal in 2002 when then-prime minister peter medgyessy -lrb- photo -rrb- was forced to admit after a leak that he had served as a counter-espionage officer under the communist regime .
several other high ranking officials in both left-wing and right-wing administrations have since admitted having worked for the communist secret service .
besides medgyessy , who was forced out of power in a coalition row last september , a commission set up in 2002 found high-ranking officials with secret service pasts in each government administration since 1990 .
but it did not reveal any names .
soccer spy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer players , too , were spied upon central bank president zsigmond jarai , finance minister under former conservative prime minister viktor orban , has also admitted he worked in the counter-espionage division when the communists were in power .
recently , names of celebrities have been splashed across newspaper front pages linking them to their secret pasts .
former hungary international soccer star dezso novak -lrb- 65 -rrb- was forced to admit he spied for the secret police in the 1960s and ' 70s when he regularly filed reports on his teammates .
novak won the olympic title twice with hungary and the uefa cup with local team ferencvaros in 1965 . dw staff / afp -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hunt for east german money thursday marks the first international anti corruption day .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

" it was my first derby match with schalke and the atmosphere was incredible , " admitted ailton .
" it is too early to say whether i will win the title for the second year in a row .
we will have to wait and see . " " for ailton 's goal we had two players lying on the ground and it is not easy to defend when you are on your backside , " fumed dortmund chief bert van marwijk .
dortmund are now 14th in the bundesliga table just three points clear of the relegation zone . in sunday 's second contest , also a derby , kaiserslautern beat their easterly neighbors , 2-0 . bildunterschrift : meanwhile , leaders bayern munich were left cursing a late slip that allowed bavarian rivals fc nuremberg to peg them back to a 2-2 draw on saturday .
bayern and schalke are now level on 33 points and both sides have a chance of winning the honorific title of ' winter champions ' in the final set of fixtures before the winter hiatus next weekend . goals aplenty in week 16 if freiburg want to stay in the first division , they did n't show it on saturday .
they fell hard , losing 6-0 to defending champions bremen .
the contest was decided early as miroslav klose -lrb- 10 goals this season -rrb- scored in a span of three minutes midway through the first half .
greek striker angelos charisteas extended the lead to 3-0 for bremen in the 31st minute . in the second half , charisteas would score twice more and johan micoud would put one in the net .
the long trip to freiburg was definitely worth it for bremen . freiburg look like they have given up all hope of dragging themselves away from relegation .
they are now in last place on ten points .
bremen have had problems all season getting victories against obviously weaker opponents but did it this saturday .
thomas schaaf 's club has 27 points and is sitting in 6th place . a second match finished 6-0 , this one in berlin where hertha tore borussia mönchengladbach apart .
the game was close at half , 1-0 on a giuseppe reina goal .
in the second half , the dams broke .
yildiray bastürk scored twice , alexander madlung , nando rafael and marcelinho the remaining goals . gladbach have dropped their last three games , as they find themselves just outside the relegation zone on 16 points .
berlin have not lost since october 26 and are in seventh place . bildunterschrift : seven goals fell in stuttgart as the home team won 5-2 against bochum .
the hosts went ahead 2-0 on a bochum own goal and a kevin kuranyi strike .
bochum fought back gamely , tying it early in the second half before stuttgart sealed it with three goals within 14 minutes .
bochum remains in 16th place in the drop zone ; stuttgart is now in third place . former leaders drifting back wolfsburg had been sitting in first place for much of the season .
now they have lost three in a row after a heart-wrenching defeat in leverkusen , 2-1 .
maybe they went ahead too early .
in the fourth minute diego klimowicz scored .
leverkusen tied it just as the second half started and then handed wolfsburg the defeat with a franca headball goal in the 89th minute .
wolfsburg is slowly drifting downwards , now in fifth on 27 points .
leverkusen has 25 and sits in eighth place . the bundesliga has n't taken hanover seriously so far this season , but their solid play , particularly on defense , has sent them skyrocketing to the top ranks .
on saturday , they handily beat hamburg on the road , 2-0 and sit incredibly in fourth place on 28 points .
hamburg was hot coming into the match .
nevertheless , they are still in the middle of the pack on 22 points . hansa rostock did their best to win on the road in bielefeld .
they took the lead in the 52nd minute but bielefeld came home with the draw on patrick owomoyela 's goal in the 64th minute .
because of the extent of the freiburg defeat , rostock exits the cellar on goal difference and stands in 17th on 10 points . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derby weekend in the bundesliga even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .

" it was my first derby match with schalke and the atmosphere was incredible , " admitted ailton .
" it is too early to say whether i will win the title for the second year in a row .
we will have to wait and see . " " for ailton 's goal we had two players lying on the ground and it is not easy to defend when you are on your backside , " fumed dortmund chief bert van marwijk .
dortmund are now 14th in the bundesliga table just three points clear of the relegation zone . in sunday 's second contest , also a derby , kaiserslautern beat their easterly neighbors , 2-0 . bildunterschrift : meanwhile , leaders bayern munich were left cursing a late slip that allowed bavarian rivals fc nuremberg to peg them back to a 2-2 draw on saturday .
bayern and schalke are now level on 33 points and both sides have a chance of winning the honorific title of ' winter champions ' in the final set of fixtures before the winter hiatus next weekend . goals aplenty in week 16 if freiburg want to stay in the first division , they did n't show it on saturday .
they fell hard , losing 6-0 to defending champions bremen .
the contest was decided early as miroslav klose -lrb- 10 goals this season -rrb- scored in a span of three minutes midway through the first half .
greek striker angelos charisteas extended the lead to 3-0 for bremen in the 31st minute . in the second half , charisteas would score twice more and johan micoud would put one in the net .
the long trip to freiburg was definitely worth it for bremen . freiburg look like they have given up all hope of dragging themselves away from relegation .
they are now in last place on ten points .
bremen have had problems all season getting victories against obviously weaker opponents but did it this saturday .
thomas schaaf 's club has 27 points and is sitting in 6th place . a second match finished 6-0 , this one in berlin where hertha tore borussia mönchengladbach apart .
the game was close at half , 1-0 on a giuseppe reina goal .
in the second half , the dams broke .
yildiray bastürk scored twice , alexander madlung , nando rafael and marcelinho the remaining goals . gladbach have dropped their last three games , as they find themselves just outside the relegation zone on 16 points .
berlin have not lost since october 26 and are in seventh place . bildunterschrift : seven goals fell in stuttgart as the home team won 5-2 against bochum .
the hosts went ahead 2-0 on a bochum own goal and a kevin kuranyi strike .
bochum fought back gamely , tying it early in the second half before stuttgart sealed it with three goals within 14 minutes .
bochum remains in 16th place in the drop zone ; stuttgart is now in third place . former leaders drifting back wolfsburg had been sitting in first place for much of the season .
now they have lost three in a row after a heart-wrenching defeat in leverkusen , 2-1 .
maybe they went ahead too early .
in the fourth minute diego klimowicz scored .
leverkusen tied it just as the second half started and then handed wolfsburg the defeat with a franca headball goal in the 89th minute .
wolfsburg is slowly drifting downwards , now in fifth on 27 points .
leverkusen has 25 and sits in eighth place . the bundesliga has n't taken hanover seriously so far this season , but their solid play , particularly on defense , has sent them skyrocketing to the top ranks .
on saturday , they handily beat hamburg on the road , 2-0 and sit incredibly in fourth place on 28 points .
hamburg was hot coming into the match .
nevertheless , they are still in the middle of the pack on 22 points . hansa rostock did their best to win on the road in bielefeld .
they took the lead in the 52nd minute but bielefeld came home with the draw on patrick owomoyela 's goal in the 64th minute .
because of the extent of the freiburg defeat , rostock exits the cellar on goal difference and stands in 17th on 10 points . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derby weekend in the bundesliga even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .

" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .

schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

" the mszp -lrb- socialist party -rrb- is working on a bill that would allow free access to the national security documents housed in the historical archives , " party president istvan hiller told a news conference .
" the unfortunate and fruitless disputes must come to an end , " added the party 's new leader , in reference to leaks to the press implicating everyone from politicians to footballers of collaborating with the secret service .
" we can only plan safely for the future if we face the past and have closure , " he said . the socialist party , which counts among its ranks many former communists , had been against divulging the files from the cold war era when spying on each other was commonplace .
its coalition partner , the free democrats , - with many ex-dissident members - was for opening them .
the bill foresees making available dossiers of the communist security apparatus which contain secrets on collaborators with the espionage , counter-espionage and the domestic intelligence services , socialist parliamentarian sandor burany said . high ranking officials had spy posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter medgyessy hungary was hit by a scandal in 2002 when then-prime minister peter medgyessy -lrb- photo -rrb- was forced to admit after a leak that he had served as a counter-espionage officer under the communist regime .
several other high ranking officials in both left-wing and right-wing administrations have since admitted having worked for the communist secret service .
besides medgyessy , who was forced out of power in a coalition row last september , a commission set up in 2002 found high-ranking officials with secret service pasts in each government administration since 1990 .
but it did not reveal any names .
soccer spy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer players , too , were spied upon central bank president zsigmond jarai , finance minister under former conservative prime minister viktor orban , has also admitted he worked in the counter-espionage division when the communists were in power .
recently , names of celebrities have been splashed across newspaper front pages linking them to their secret pasts .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .

" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.12.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc 18 cases of abuse in german army alleged the german defense ministry has uncovered 18 cases of mistreatment perpetrated on subordinates by superiors in military barracks , the german media say in reports published thursday .
a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.12.2004 who 's your daddy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fathers want to know if they 're the biological parent of their child father 's rights groups in germany are fighting to retain their right to have secret paternity tests without a mother 's permission .
they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

" the mszp -lrb- socialist party -rrb- is working on a bill that would allow free access to the national security documents housed in the historical archives , " party president istvan hiller told a news conference .
" the unfortunate and fruitless disputes must come to an end , " added the party 's new leader , in reference to leaks to the press implicating everyone from politicians to footballers of collaborating with the secret service .
" we can only plan safely for the future if we face the past and have closure , " he said . the socialist party , which counts among its ranks many former communists , had been against divulging the files from the cold war era when spying on each other was commonplace .
its coalition partner , the free democrats , - with many ex-dissident members - was for opening them .
the bill foresees making available dossiers of the communist security apparatus which contain secrets on collaborators with the espionage , counter-espionage and the domestic intelligence services , socialist parliamentarian sandor burany said . high ranking officials had spy posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter medgyessy hungary was hit by a scandal in 2002 when then-prime minister peter medgyessy -lrb- photo -rrb- was forced to admit after a leak that he had served as a counter-espionage officer under the communist regime .
several other high ranking officials in both left-wing and right-wing administrations have since admitted having worked for the communist secret service .
besides medgyessy , who was forced out of power in a coalition row last september , a commission set up in 2002 found high-ranking officials with secret service pasts in each government administration since 1990 .
but it did not reveal any names .
soccer spy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer players , too , were spied upon central bank president zsigmond jarai , finance minister under former conservative prime minister viktor orban , has also admitted he worked in the counter-espionage division when the communists were in power .
recently , names of celebrities have been splashed across newspaper front pages linking them to their secret pasts .
former hungary international soccer star dezso novak -lrb- 65 -rrb- was forced to admit he spied for the secret police in the 1960s and ' 70s when he regularly filed reports on his teammates .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

" the mszp -lrb- socialist party -rrb- is working on a bill that would allow free access to the national security documents housed in the historical archives , " party president istvan hiller told a news conference .
" the unfortunate and fruitless disputes must come to an end , " added the party 's new leader , in reference to leaks to the press implicating everyone from politicians to footballers of collaborating with the secret service .
" we can only plan safely for the future if we face the past and have closure , " he said . the socialist party , which counts among its ranks many former communists , had been against divulging the files from the cold war era when spying on each other was commonplace .
its coalition partner , the free democrats , - with many ex-dissident members - was for opening them .
the bill foresees making available dossiers of the communist security apparatus which contain secrets on collaborators with the espionage , counter-espionage and the domestic intelligence services , socialist parliamentarian sandor burany said . high ranking officials had spy posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter medgyessy hungary was hit by a scandal in 2002 when then-prime minister peter medgyessy -lrb- photo -rrb- was forced to admit after a leak that he had served as a counter-espionage officer under the communist regime .
several other high ranking officials in both left-wing and right-wing administrations have since admitted having worked for the communist secret service .
besides medgyessy , who was forced out of power in a coalition row last september , a commission set up in 2002 found high-ranking officials with secret service pasts in each government administration since 1990 .
but it did not reveal any names .
soccer spy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer players , too , were spied upon central bank president zsigmond jarai , finance minister under former conservative prime minister viktor orban , has also admitted he worked in the counter-espionage division when the communists were in power .
recently , names of celebrities have been splashed across newspaper front pages linking them to their secret pasts .
former hungary international soccer star dezso novak -lrb- 65 -rrb- was forced to admit he spied for the secret police in the 1960s and ' 70s when he regularly filed reports on his teammates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2004 powell re-buffed by nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he believes the friendship between the us and europe still exists us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .
nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .

east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .

following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .

it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .

" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .

wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .

wolfgang daschner -lrb- 61 -rrb- was accused of giving the order to a senior officer in the interrogation of magnus gäfgen , who was suspected of kidnapping jakob von metzler .
at the time of the questioning in october 2002 , the boy was still listed as missing .
only later did it emerge that he had already been killed by gäfgen .
the prosecutor requested that daschner be given a suspended fine of € 27,000 -lrb- $ 35,800 -rrb- and pay € 10,000 to charity .
that sum will not be suspended .
in his summing-up , prosecutor wilhelm möllers said the extraordinary circumstances of the case meant that the sentence should be far more lenient than the normal penalty for incitement to intimidation , which carries a prison term of between six months and five years .
the prosecutor also recommended that the 51-year-old senior officer , who has not been named , be given a suspended fine of € 14,400 and pay € 5,000 to charity .

shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .

more than 15 years after reunification , the german government is still trying to clear up decades of corruption practiced by the former east germany . german unification in 1990 marked the end of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
east joined with west germany and the assets of the gdr 's ruling socialist unity party -lrb- sed -rrb- went into the hands of the privatization agency for eastern germany , the so-called treuhandanstalt .
but the sed leadership by no means kept all of its funds within german borders .
for years now , the german government has been trying to track down this money .
shortly before reunification , the east german parliament or volkskammer set up an independent commission called ukpv to review the assets of the parties and mass organizations of the gdr .
ukpv now operates within the german interior ministry .
according to a ukpv spokesman , it is impossible to specify precisely just how much money has disappeared .
" certainly , a great deal was moved and there will be a lot that will never be revealed , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with german government policy .
the end of a lengthy battle but the commission has had some success stories .
last month , the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled that germany is entitled to the assets of the former gdr foreign trade company novum , totalling € 200 million -lrb- $ 265 million -rrb- .
the decision ended a legal battle lasting over a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deutsche marks were replaced by the euro in 2002 novum was founded in 1951 to mediate the extraordinary foreign trade - trade that wasn ’ t part of the planned economy - between the gdr and austria .
" novum arbitrated business and got a commission for this , " the ukpv spokesman said .
following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .
" secret paternity tests violate the rights of the child and the mother , " she said .
" they also violate data protection laws . " according to zypries and her supporters , which include prominent green parliamentarians , the rights of the child supersede the rights of the father . fathers fight for their rights a growing movement of father 's rights advocates in germany , who have united under the banner the network for paternity tests and launched a web site at pro-test.net , take issue with zypries ' line of argument .
they have started a grassroots effort , complete with buttons and bumper stickers , to block the legislation . with a few christian democratic and free liberal politicians currently in the german opposition coming out on their side , the movement is gathering steam . incest claims in addition to arguments stressing a father 's right to know , the network opposing the legislation has made some other fairly remarkable claims .
they say banning the paternity tests could result in an alarming rise in incest , since half brothers and sisters - who are not aware they are related - may become involved . the group also claims so-called " test tourism " could mushroom , much like the abortion tourism which became prevalent in the 1970s when german women who were prevented from having abortions at home travelled to the more liberal holland . they also counter advocates ' claims that secret paternity tests endanger the rights of the child and break up families .
in their view , it is far more harmful for children to grow-up in a family held together by a web of lies . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects teenager 's claim for cash from wealthy father a teenage girl has failed to convince a german court that her wealthy father should pay her more financial support than is required by law .

following the fall of the iron curtain , novum ’ s managing director and sole shareholder , rudolfine steindling transferred millions of swiss francs out of novum ’ s accounts in switzerland to private persons without any economic basis .
" we are talking about a big black hole here , " the ukpv spokesman said , adding that estimates lie at some € 250 million .
the treuhandanstalt successor bvs has taken civil action in switzerland to recover the money .
steindling , otherwise known as " the red fini " for her tight contacts to austria ’ s communist party -lrb- kpö -rrb- , had insisted novum was not owned by the sed , but rather by the kpö .
extracting money for the stasi in a separate case in austria , germany in april won a 10-year legal battle against the austrian schoellerbank .
prior to reunification , the east berlin company fc gerlach transferred close to € 75 million to the account of the fictitious company anstalt fortintakt , registered in liechtenstein .
but fc gerlach was operating as a front .
it was controlled by alexander schalck-golodkowski , who ran the gdr 's foreign trade and foreign exchange operations , but was also a special officer for the much-feared east german secret service stasi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum in berlin was formerly the headquarters of the much-feared east german secret service under schalck-golodkowski , the stasi for decades procured hard currency through bogus companies abroad .
schoellerbank initially refused to release the funds from the fortintakt account .
but following the ruling by austria 's supreme court , the bank has transferred the full amount plus interest , totalling € 146.5 million .
" the purpose of the gdr 's foreign organizations was to pretend to the west that you were working with real companies , " florian kremslehner , the attorney representing the german government in the case , told austrian media .
" but in reality , the stasi was behind it all . "
help for the eastern states according to germany 's unity treaty , the sed assets are supposed to be used for non-profit purposes , as well as the economic restructuring of the new eastern german states .
in november , for example , the federal government transferred € 55 million in former sed funds to the stiftung zur aufarbeitung der sed-diktatur , a foundation dedicated to researching the causes and impact of the sed dictatorship .
parliamentarian siegfried scheffler , spokesman for the eastern german states in the lower house bundestag , said other trails of sed funds also led to hungary .
last year , he asked german chancellor gerhard schröder to discuss this problem while he was visiting budapest .
although the hungarian government had officially promised to work together with german authorities , the ministerial red tape , as well as bureaucracy on the part of the banks concerned constituted " hardly concealed delaying tactics , " he said .
the situation has improved , however , since schröder 's visit in november 2003 .
" there has been some movement now , but the research is still going on , " scheffler said .
" we still do n't know how much sed money was parked in hungary . "
the ukpv spokesman said countries have been " very cooperative " in supporting the german government 's enquiries .
still , the commission has its work cut out for it .
through bank transactions , for example , it finds leads and sends an auditor .
" but then it depends on how tight the evidence is , " he said . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin improves in battling corruption according to the latest report by transparency international , germany has made strides in countering corruption .

the message was delivered during an eu-china summit in the hague when eu representatives met chinese premier wen jiabao .
" we are working assiduously but ... the time is not right to lift the embargo , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot , current head of the council .
there is broad agreement among eu members for lifting the embargo , but concerns over human rights and us opposition are delaying the move .
the us is keen not to see hi-tech european weapons in chinese hands , although chinese officials say that lifting the embargo is of political rather than military significance .
the eu is also looking for china to speed up the ratification of the un covenant on civil and political rights .
china is keen to emphasize that it now a responsible player on the world stage and views the ban as anachronistic .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

nato officials dashed us hopes the alliance would significantly boost contributions to iraq and afghanistan . on the first day of his trip to europe , what many are calling a " charm offensive " to sooth over tense transatlantic relations , us secretary of state colin powell received disappointing news .
despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

despite us hopes european members of the alliance would contribute to a larger officer training facility in iraq and expand peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , he came up empty-handed .
at thursday 's meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer hailed the decision on the part of certain members of the alliance , including hungary , the netherlands , norway and poland , to send more staff to an existing training facility in baghdad , thereby boosting the total number from 60 to 300 .
but that contribution falls well below us expectations , and prompted an angry outburst from powell at a press conference .
he specifically took issue with certain nato members ' decision to prevent staff seconded to the alliance from taking part in military training missions in iraq , namely belgium , france , germany , greece , and spain .
" when it comes time to perform a mission , it seems to us to be quite awkward for suddenly members of that international staff to say they are unable to go , " he said , claiming such actions undermine the credibility and cohesion of nato .
powell makes final lap around europe in what will likely to be his last european trip as us secretary of state , colin powell arrived in brussels hoping washington and europe could come together again to respond to new threats and promote democracy .
ahead of the nato meeting , he said he was aware that some of president george w. bush 's key decisions in the last four years had been controversial in europe , especially those concerning iraq .
" whatever our differences about the past and about iraq , we are looking forward , " powell said in a speech to the german marshall fund in brussels on wednesday .
" we 're reaching out to europe , and we hope that europe will reach out to us . "
" we can handle the bumps and bruises . "
powell pointed out that bush would make his first trip abroad in his second term to europe to visit the eu and nato on feb .
22 and that the first official visitor he received at the white house after winning re-election in november had been nato chief de hoop scheffer .
he offered both as evidence of new us overtures to europe , where bush is widely perceived as a belligerent unilateralist and remains deeply unpopular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and the united states be able to see eye-to-eye again ?
powell stressed that the united states and europe were tied by deep cultural and ethical bonds and , in time , relations would get smoother .
" we can handle the bumps and bruises of transatlantic political life that can come along from time to time , " he said .
" transatlantic politics has its blustery days , but the weather eventually improves .
it 's improving as i speak and will improve further when president bush visits europe . "
helping iraq is in europe 's interest , too according to powell , victory in iraq is in everyone 's interests , even those european nations that vehemently opposed the war .
this includes successful elections in january for a transitional parliament .
" it seems to me that europe , whatever disagreement we had last year with respect to the war , should see it -lrb- also -rrb- on the basis of principle to help the iraqi people safely go to the polls and have an election to put in place a democratic government , " powell said .
at the nato meeting on thursday , the members of the alliance opposed to the invasion of iraq did not show any indication that they agreed with powell .
" there will be no -lrb- french -rrb- officers or soldiers in iraq , " french foreign minister michel barnier told reporters .

chirac said that the spanish would be in the " first row " of european integration and called on spaniards to " show the way " to other countries with a " massive yes . "
opinion polls consistently show that a majority of spanish people are in favor of the constitution .
confirming that he would " engage without holding back " in the campaign , the french president also said the campaign should not be " ruined by internal politics . "
chirac himself is set to have a difficult time persuading the french people to vote " yes " to the constitution as he tries to avoid the issue becoming entangled in the question of whether turkey should become an eu member .
however , his task was made easier by the overwhelming " yes " to the treaty that emerged during an internal referendum held by the opposition socialists last week - this may encourage him to hold the vote as early as may next year .

the name of mohamad-mehdi navab-motlagh , deputy minister for economic and international affairs in tehran , is not on the list of supervisory board members proposed for re-election at thyssenkrupp 's upcoming annual shareholders meeting on jan .
21 .
the list of candidates for re-election was published in the invitation to the meeting and was made available on thyssenkrupp 's web site .
a spokesman for the company declined to comment on the matter .
however , a number of german newspapers suggested that the departure of the iranian government official from thyssenkrupp 's supervisory board was a condition imposed by the us administration for including the german steel and engineering giant in public contracts in the us .

a 14-page ministry report says the mistreatment involves willful negligence and humiliating treatment perpetrated on subordinates by hierarchical superiors , injuries sustained during training and military training exercises which went wrong .
according to a report in the tabloid bild , a non-commissioned officer in varel , northern germany , aimed at soldiers with a loaded gun and hit them several times in the stomach and the genitals .
in another report , the daily süddeutsche zeitung said that three soldiers were injured during a military exercise which went wrong at the airport at the southwestern city of stuttgart .
it said a non-commissioned officer had also whispered obscenities in the ears of two female recruits who were tied up and blindfolded during a mock hostage-taking exercise .
according to the ministry report , probes have been opened into eight of the cases .
the new allegations come in the wake of a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers , in which a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster .
they are accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were conscripts . dw-world.de when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

next time you want to bring your loved one a bouquet of roses , you 're just as well off with a bottle of beer .
a german professor has discovered that the smell of beer is similar to that of roses . they say that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet .
but roses are the last thing you think of when putting a nice cold beer to your mouth .
" yet flowers and beer have more in common than you 'd think , " said dietrich wabner , a professor at munich 's technical university and president of the natural oils research association .
wabner developed a procedure to determine the ingredients responsible for the taste and shelf life of beer .
to his surprise , he discovered that the fragrance of beer resembles that of roses .
" we found the same essential oils in beer that are contained in roses , jasmine , grapefruit and clary sage used in perfumes , " he told the german brewer 's association dbb .
aroma therapy with beer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pretty much the same thing : flowers and beer wabner also has an explanation for the pleasant sensation we get drinking a beer .
" when we smell these aromas , it immediately triggers a sense of well-being in us , " he said .
the sense of smell is tied to the limbic system in the brain , where our feelings are also located .
" the smell of a fresh beer causes the disbursement of the body 's own opiates , which activate our memories , " he said .
" we immediately have comforting feelings : the end of the work day , nice conversations with good friends - you could call it a downright aroma therapy with beer . "
it 's good for you , too !
the golden brew has other benefits , too .
" hops is anti-bacterial and anticonvulsant , " wabner said , adding that beer 's good qualities can only be enjoyed when it 's drunk in moderation .
" the soul is happy about a comforting , analgesic and tonic effect . "
and most importantly : " a fresh beer tastes darned good . "

they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . " in a debate over paternity tests in germany - father 's rights groups are lobbying to block proposed legislation banning secret tests without the mother 's permission - advocates are employing increasingly alarmist arguments .
one group , the network for paternity tests , claims on its web site that making the tests illegal would lead to an increase in incest between half brothers and sisters who do n't know they 're related . but the core of their argument , that fathers have a right to know if the child they have been supporting financially and come to think of their own is in fact their biological offspring , is gaining sympathy .
german politicians and medical ethicists are divided , and it is not certain that the new legislation proposed by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens will be passed . a fringe issue steals spotlight the debate began quietly in 2003 , when as part of a larger packet of legislation intended to curb the misuse of diagnostic tests by employers and other interested parties , the german justice minister brigitte zypries decided to address the increasing number of anonymous paternity tests procured by fathers without the mother 's permission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests are becoming more common in her opinion , such tests threatened the integrity of the family , many of which break up after a negative result , and violated the rights of a child .

" the mszp -lrb- socialist party -rrb- is working on a bill that would allow free access to the national security documents housed in the historical archives , " party president istvan hiller told a news conference .
" the unfortunate and fruitless disputes must come to an end , " added the party 's new leader , in reference to leaks to the press implicating everyone from politicians to footballers of collaborating with the secret service .
" we can only plan safely for the future if we face the past and have closure , " he said . the socialist party , which counts among its ranks many former communists , had been against divulging the files from the cold war era when spying on each other was commonplace .
its coalition partner , the free democrats , - with many ex-dissident members - was for opening them .
the bill foresees making available dossiers of the communist security apparatus which contain secrets on collaborators with the espionage , counter-espionage and the domestic intelligence services , socialist parliamentarian sandor burany said . high ranking officials had spy posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter medgyessy hungary was hit by a scandal in 2002 when then-prime minister peter medgyessy -lrb- photo -rrb- was forced to admit after a leak that he had served as a counter-espionage officer under the communist regime .
several other high ranking officials in both left-wing and right-wing administrations have since admitted having worked for the communist secret service .
besides medgyessy , who was forced out of power in a coalition row last september , a commission set up in 2002 found high-ranking officials with secret service pasts in each government administration since 1990 .
but it did not reveal any names .

the new south american community of nations was launched at a summit in the peruvian city of cuzco .
peruvian president alejandro toledo , said a new country was being born , which would one day have a common currency , parliament and passport .
members of the new community will start by phasing out tariffs .
leaders also hope it will increase south america 's clout in international trade talks .
the new bloc territory : 17,658,000 sq km population : 361 million gdp : $ 973bn exports : $ 181bn unemployment : 12 % -lrb- can -rrb- ; 12.9 % -lrb- mercosur -rrb- ; 8.5 % -lrb- chile -rrb- source : can -lrb- 2003 -rrb- mr toledo said the new community would also help member nations " confront the challenges of globalisation so that it is fairer " .
" if in the past , geography divided us , today it unites us , " mr toledo said .
the move will create a market of 361 million people with a gdp of $ 973bn , exporting $ 181bn of goods and services .
stumbling blocs but the bbc 's hannah hennessy in cuzco says details and disputes must be resolved if the bloc is to live up to expectations .
it is born from the convergence of the two main trade groups of the region - the andean community -lrb- can -rrb- and mercosur - as well as chile , surinam and guyana .
the can was created 35 years ago , but it still has not decided on common tariffs for its members .
critics say that if existing blocs have not been able to achieve unity , this one stands little chance of doing so .
poverty is one of the greatest challenges for the new bloc there have also been criticisms that countries are putting their own interests first .
the presidents of brazil , venezuela , peru , colombia , bolivia , chile , surinam and guyana attended the summit .
the leaders of argentina , ecuador , uruguay and paraguay did not even bother attending the summit , sending envoys in their place .
others left before the signing of the declaration .
in trade terms , there is also scepticism .
some analysts note that in many cases the south american countries export the same products .
the region 's two biggest powers , brazil and argentina , are currently locked in trade disputes , while bolivia and chile have no diplomatic relations at all .
however former argentine president eduardo duhalde brushed aside the sceptics , saying the new group would not only responded to a very old integration dream but also to modern requirements .
" our countries can not face alone the challenges of the new economic and political world order , " said mr duhalde .
to emphasise this move towards greater integration , peru and brazil signed a $ 700m agreement to create a road linking the two countries to be finished by the end of his term in 2006 .

colin percy , 75 , from kirby muxloe , leics , worked at a tube plant in the county for nearly 27 years .

mr percy said : " maureen , through no fault of her own , has got it from my clothes . "
he called on the government to do more to help people like his wife who had been affected .
mrs percy said she would wash her husband 's clothes in a separate washing tub every weekend because they were so covered in dust from the factory .
she is now taking legal action to try to win compensation for contracting the deadly disease .
liz darliston , from the macmillan mesothelioma resource centre at glenfield hospital in leicester , said : " the whole disease is an injustice , irrespective of how you have been exposed to asbestos .
" but if you add to that that you ca n't claim the same benefits as another sufferer just because you were exposed to asbestos washing your husband 's clothes , that adds to the injustice of the disease . "
a spokeswoman for the department of work and pensions said : " there are no current plans to extend the scope of the industrial injuries scheme to the family members of asbestosis sufferers , or to people who have been exposed to asbestos outside of their work . "

the train drivers , who normally work sundays as overtime , have decided not to work on 12 december to highlight ongoing pay talks .
midland mainline says they have offered the union members a 4 % pay rise , but that has been turned down .
under the current agreement drivers are not contracted to work on sundays .

" sundays are voluntary and some guys have decided not to come to work on that day , " he said .
the cancellation affects passengers travelling on the entire midland mainline route from london to sheffield , which also serves nottingham , leicester and derby .
the action follows a similar cancellation in april which brought train services to a standstill .
midland mainline says it is very disappointed by the move and is reviewing the policy of not contracting drivers to work on sundays .
company spokesperson emma knight said : " we have 200-odd drivers and none of them has volunteered to work on sunday - we believe it is over the pay talks . "
the firm is advising passengers to avoid travelling on sunday or to use alternative rail routes , or replacement bus services .
passengers who have pre-booked tickets for sunday , but decide not to travel , can request a full refund .

the train drivers , who normally work sundays as overtime , have decided not to work on 12 december to highlight ongoing pay talks .
midland mainline says they have offered the union members a 4 % pay rise , but that has been turned down .
under the current agreement drivers are not contracted to work on sundays .

the cancellation affects passengers travelling on the entire midland mainline route from london to sheffield , which also serves nottingham , leicester and derby .

midland mainline says it is very disappointed by the move and is reviewing the policy of not contracting drivers to work on sundays .
