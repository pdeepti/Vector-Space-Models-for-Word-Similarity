program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto .

his foreign secretary jack straw added to the compliments , saying it " had been a joy to work " with powell .
“ i am confident that whoever president bush appoints to succeed secretary powell will be somebody with whom the uk government will be able to work very closely and with whom i will be able swiftly to have a good working relationship , ” said straw .
fischer 's close friend the former four-star general was widely perceived as the bush administration cabinet member most sympathetic to european views .
in his book " plan of attack " , journalist bob woodward depicted powell as the person in bush 's foreign policy team most critical of the administration 's march towards a military invasion of iraq , something that endeared him to european opponents of the war . german foreign minister joschka fischer considered powell a close friend as well as a colleague .
speaking to reporters following powell 's resignation , fischer said the secretary was a man who understood germany very well , from his time here as a soldier .
despite policy differences between the two countries , fischer said he never found it difficult to communicate with his counterpart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , open up a three-point lead at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1reverse against hertha berlin .
however , bayern munich can move to within one point of wolfsburg with all three points at vfl bochum on sunday .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
german champions werder bremen missed the chance to close in on the pretenders to their crown with a 2-2 draw against bayer leverkusen .
werder are now six points adrift of wolves back in sixth place .
since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on sept .
18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
but a 3-0 triumph over stuttgart at the volkswagen arena helped the wolves have the honor of leading the german standings for another week .
petrov steals the show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's martin petrov showed world class quality when finishing two individual goals .
the wolves were demolished 5-1 by stuttgart at home last season but surged into a 42nd minute lead through thomas brdaric .
some poor defending was pivotal to the goal and this theme continued in the 69th minute when martin petrov walzed around markus babbel to rifle past timo hildebrand .
the bulgarian attacker grabbed his second in the 76th minute to complete a miserable week for stuttgart who crashed out of the german cup to bayern on wednesday .
a capacity 61,500 crowd at the arena auf schalke watched schalke 's record run of six successive wins come to an end as hertha ran out 3-1 winners .
brazilian marcelinho opened the scoring in the 42nd minute for berlin but the hosts restored parity with hertha goalkeeper christian fiedler gifting a goal to gerald asamoah after 50 minutes .
schalke pushed for another goal but came undone on the counter attack with angolan nando rafael -lrb- 71 -rrb- and niko kovac -lrb- 83 -rrb- on target .
champs falter bremen failed to take advantage of the schalke slip , playing out a 2-2 draw with leverkusen at the weserstadion .
miroslav klose was rested in midweek and showed his sharpness with an instinctive strike in the 19th minute after bayer goalkeeper hans jorg butt had fumbled a cross .
but bayer turned the game on its head in the second half with ukraine international andrei voronin equalizing in the 51st minute , and 120 seconds later leverkusen were in front .
bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , who had hit the post in the first half , took advantage of some invisible marking to head in a corner from the right .
bremen 's paraguayan supersub nelson haedo valdez salavaged a point with his 72nd-minute leveller , but werder have some work to do to force their way back into the title race .
elsewhere borussia dortmund , with an injury list totalling 14 players , fell to a 1-0 defeat at kaiserslautern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , open up a three-point lead at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1reverse against hertha berlin .
however , bayern munich can move to within one point of wolfsburg with all three points at vfl bochum on sunday .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
german champions werder bremen missed the chance to close in on the pretenders to their crown with a 2-2 draw against bayer leverkusen .
werder are now six points adrift of wolves back in sixth place .
since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on sept .
18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
but a 3-0 triumph over stuttgart at the volkswagen arena helped the wolves have the honor of leading the german standings for another week .
petrov steals the show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's martin petrov showed world class quality when finishing two individual goals .

that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .

there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner .

on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ? no sooner had the german economy surmounted the latest dramatic climb in oil prices , than it was forced to face a new demon in the shape of a stubbornly strong euro .
the fearful have responded in a chorus of woeful lament , predicting a rise in the price of german exports , and a subsequent fall in demand thereof .
and because the slight upward turn in the ailing economy has been almost exclusively thanks to germany 's exporters , the fear is that such a shift could plunge germany right back into recession . this , however , is not just a german problem , but a european one , to which the president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , jean-claude trichet , paid testimony with words of unusual gravity .
" it is a brutal , most unwelcome appreciation , " he said .
yet trichet 's concern is not so much the present exchange rate as the phenomenon of fluctuation in the common currency .
such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .

by partnering one german school with each of the 205 members of soccer 's global association fifa , organizers want to involve kids in germany and abroad in the planet 's biggest sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann german national coach jürgen klinsmann , joined by german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , on friday officially started the project at an elementary school in berlin .
it was there that the german schools were matched up with institutions from azerbaijan to zambia . under the title " world cup schools - fair play for fair life , " the project will involve fifth and sixth graders from the 205 schools with their fifa partner country for the next two years .
the kids will learn about the other children from their nation and what role soccer plays there .
it is hoped that besides increasing excitement for the sport and the upcoming world cup , kids on both sides will learn about tolerance , team spirit and solving problems peacefully . international credentials highlighting the project 's international credentials , klinsmann played soccer with german kids in two teams representing croatia and the dominican republic , on friday , after the selection of partner schools . the participating schools will organize regional tournaments and will take over the role of their respective countries in the summer of 2005 .
for example , schools with latin american partners will represent them at a mock copa america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highpoint will come a year later during the world cup itself when 32 schools will take part in a street soccer tournament in potsdam .
both boys and girls will play modeled on a method made popular by " street soccer for tolerance , " which has the players set up the rules with each other .
besides eliminating the need for referees , it also determines that goals made by boys only count when a girl also makes a goal . much of the project is based on the work of " streetfootballworld , " an initiative to use the sport as a tool to aid development and intercultural learning for youth .
the program started in colombia in 1996 to offer kids an alternative to drugs and violence .
it has since set up a global network to help celebrate and take advantage of soccer 's grassroots role in many societies around the world . both the german government and deutsche welle are supporting partners of " world cup schools " and " streetfootballworld .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

by partnering one german school with each of the 205 members of soccer 's global association fifa , organizers want to involve kids in germany and abroad in the planet 's biggest sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann german national coach jürgen klinsmann , joined by german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , on friday officially started the project at an elementary school in berlin .
it was there that the german schools were matched up with institutions from azerbaijan to zambia . under the title " world cup schools - fair play for fair life , " the project will involve fifth and sixth graders from the 205 schools with their fifa partner country for the next two years .
the kids will learn about the other children from their nation and what role soccer plays there .
it is hoped that besides increasing excitement for the sport and the upcoming world cup , kids on both sides will learn about tolerance , team spirit and solving problems peacefully . international credentials highlighting the project 's international credentials , klinsmann played soccer with german kids in two teams representing croatia and the dominican republic , on friday , after the selection of partner schools . the participating schools will organize regional tournaments and will take over the role of their respective countries in the summer of 2005 .
for example , schools with latin american partners will represent them at a mock copa america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highpoint will come a year later during the world cup itself when 32 schools will take part in a street soccer tournament in potsdam .
both boys and girls will play modeled on a method made popular by " street soccer for tolerance , " which has the players set up the rules with each other .
besides eliminating the need for referees , it also determines that goals made by boys only count when a girl also makes a goal . much of the project is based on the work of " streetfootballworld , " an initiative to use the sport as a tool to aid development and intercultural learning for youth .
the program started in colombia in 1996 to offer kids an alternative to drugs and violence .
it has since set up a global network to help celebrate and take advantage of soccer 's grassroots role in many societies around the world . both the german government and deutsche welle are supporting partners of " world cup schools " and " streetfootballworld .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

" if we get into power , we are now in a position to act immediately , " stoiber said .
under the current system , workers and employers pay a percentage of gross monthly pay depending on income .
employers ' costs such as healthcare are a major obstacle to hiring in europe 's largest economy .
however the german press criticized the compromise as overly bureaucratic and said it was unlikely to be introduced in its current form , even if the cdu defeats chancellor gerhard schroeder in the general elections due in 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2004 strong euro sparks export fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is riding high the euro is climbing from strength to strength .
on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ? no sooner had the german economy surmounted the latest dramatic climb in oil prices , than it was forced to face a new demon in the shape of a stubbornly strong euro .
the fearful have responded in a chorus of woeful lament , predicting a rise in the price of german exports , and a subsequent fall in demand thereof .
and because the slight upward turn in the ailing economy has been almost exclusively thanks to germany 's exporters , the fear is that such a shift could plunge germany right back into recession . this , however , is not just a german problem , but a european one , to which the president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , jean-claude trichet , paid testimony with words of unusual gravity .
" it is a brutal , most unwelcome appreciation , " he said .
yet trichet 's concern is not so much the present exchange rate as the phenomenon of fluctuation in the common currency .
such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .

the parliament , which flexed its muscles and forced the first line-up to be withdrawn two weeks ago , is determined to make sure that these hearings are not perceived as being of a lower standard .
" the parliament will be just as strong as last time .
it is not a case of rushing everything quickly through the second time , " said a parliament spokesperson . as before , the behind-the-scenes political machinations are continuing .
the vote will take place on thursday and , as meps can only reject the commission as a whole and not individual commissioners , it is expected to be positive .

wins for leaders wolfsburg and bayern munich , who were fourth before the action this weekend , defeats for schalke 04 and stuttgart , second and third respectively , and a draw for the champions werder bremen in fifth meant that the top two teams on sunday evening had earned themselves some breathing space .
bayern moved up to second , one point adrift of wolfsburg , thanks to rising peruvian star paulo guerrero who proved to be the bavarians ' knight in shining armor , scoring twice in five minutes to help his team to a 3-1 win at vfl bochum on sunday .
guerrero , 20 , came on for compatriot claudio pizarro at half-time and had a huge impact equalizing in the 76th minute and then scoring again on 81 minutes .
an own goal from christoph preuss sixty seconds later meant bochum , who had led through vratislav lokvenc 's 66th minute opener , had thrown the match away conceding three goals in six hectic minutes .
bildunterschrift : despite the victory bayern general manager uli hoeness was angry about criticism of how munich played .
" when we have to justify a 3-1 win away from home it is time to give up , " explained hoeness .
" i want people to accept our performances for what they are - they are good . "
wolves consolidate lead at the top surprise package wolfsburg remain on top of the bundesliga following a comfortable 3-0 home win over vfb stuttgart on sunday .
the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , stay at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1 reverse against hertha berlin .
" tactically that was our best performance of the season , " said a delighted wolves boss erik gerets .
" we would not be able to beat a team such as stuttgart without such tactical nous . "
bildunterschrift : since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on september 18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
wolves were demolished 5-1 by stuttgart at home last season but took revenge with a 3-0 win .
goals from thomas brdaric -lrb- 42 -rrb- and martin petrov -lrb- 69 , 76 -rrb- completed a miserable week for stuttgart who crashed out of the german cup to bayern on wednesday .
royal blues slip up in shock defeat schalke 04 were looking to keep the pressure up on the wolves from their second place berth before saturday 's clash with hertha berlin .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
a capacity 61,500 crowd at the arena auf schalke watched schalke 's record run of six successive wins come to an end .
german international gerald asamoah cancelled out brazilian marcelinho 's opener for berlin but schalke then came undone on the counter attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2004 russia 's wto ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin wants russia to join the wto but is prepared to wait for more than 10 years moscow has been applying the join the world trade organization .
this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "
nevertheless she believes that russia will become a member within the next few years - and that , for the europeans , would be an important development , not only from a political but also from an economical point of view . karin kails -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ratifies kyoto protocol russia 's parliament ratified the un climate accord friday in a historic vote that virtually guarantees the treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions will finally enter into force seven years after its creation .

such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .

his foreign secretary jack straw added to the compliments , saying it " had been a joy to work " with powell .
“ i am confident that whoever president bush appoints to succeed secretary powell will be somebody with whom the uk government will be able to work very closely and with whom i will be able swiftly to have a good working relationship , ” said straw .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it .

it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .

by partnering one german school with each of the 205 members of soccer 's global association fifa , organizers want to involve kids in germany and abroad in the planet 's biggest sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann german national coach jürgen klinsmann , joined by german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , on friday officially started the project at an elementary school in berlin .
it was there that the german schools were matched up with institutions from azerbaijan to zambia . under the title " world cup schools - fair play for fair life , " the project will involve fifth and sixth graders from the 205 schools with their fifa partner country for the next two years .
the kids will learn about the other children from their nation and what role soccer plays there .
it is hoped that besides increasing excitement for the sport and the upcoming world cup , kids on both sides will learn about tolerance , team spirit and solving problems peacefully . international credentials highlighting the project 's international credentials , klinsmann played soccer with german kids in two teams representing croatia and the dominican republic , on friday , after the selection of partner schools . the participating schools will organize regional tournaments and will take over the role of their respective countries in the summer of 2005 .
for example , schools with latin american partners will represent them at a mock copa america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highpoint will come a year later during the world cup itself when 32 schools will take part in a street soccer tournament in potsdam .
both boys and girls will play modeled on a method made popular by " street soccer for tolerance , " which has the players set up the rules with each other .
besides eliminating the need for referees , it also determines that goals made by boys only count when a girl also makes a goal . much of the project is based on the work of " streetfootballworld , " an initiative to use the sport as a tool to aid development and intercultural learning for youth .
the program started in colombia in 1996 to offer kids an alternative to drugs and violence .
it has since set up a global network to help celebrate and take advantage of soccer 's grassroots role in many societies around the world . both the german government and deutsche welle are supporting partners of " world cup schools " and " streetfootballworld .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with denglish will all europeans speak english ?
should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it . "
and so , most certainly , are opponents of denglish everywhere . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsch please , we 're german as the world celebrates international mother language day , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .

this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "

that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto .

this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "
nevertheless she believes that russia will become a member within the next few years - and that , for the europeans , would be an important development , not only from a political but also from an economical point of view . karin kails -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ratifies kyoto protocol russia 's parliament ratified the un climate accord friday in a historic vote that virtually guarantees the treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions will finally enter into force seven years after its creation .

his foreign secretary jack straw added to the compliments , saying it " had been a joy to work " with powell .
“ i am confident that whoever president bush appoints to succeed secretary powell will be somebody with whom the uk government will be able to work very closely and with whom i will be able swiftly to have a good working relationship , ” said straw .
fischer 's close friend the former four-star general was widely perceived as the bush administration cabinet member most sympathetic to european views .
in his book " plan of attack " , journalist bob woodward depicted powell as the person in bush 's foreign policy team most critical of the administration 's march towards a military invasion of iraq , something that endeared him to european opponents of the war . german foreign minister joschka fischer considered powell a close friend as well as a colleague .

the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , open up a three-point lead at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1reverse against hertha berlin .
however , bayern munich can move to within one point of wolfsburg with all three points at vfl bochum on sunday .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
german champions werder bremen missed the chance to close in on the pretenders to their crown with a 2-2 draw against bayer leverkusen .
werder are now six points adrift of wolves back in sixth place .
since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on sept .
18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
but a 3-0 triumph over stuttgart at the volkswagen arena helped the wolves have the honor of leading the german standings for another week .
petrov steals the show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's martin petrov showed world class quality when finishing two individual goals .
the wolves were demolished 5-1 by stuttgart at home last season but surged into a 42nd minute lead through thomas brdaric .
some poor defending was pivotal to the goal and this theme continued in the 69th minute when martin petrov walzed around markus babbel to rifle past timo hildebrand .
the bulgarian attacker grabbed his second in the 76th minute to complete a miserable week for stuttgart who crashed out of the german cup to bayern on wednesday .
a capacity 61,500 crowd at the arena auf schalke watched schalke 's record run of six successive wins come to an end as hertha ran out 3-1 winners .
brazilian marcelinho opened the scoring in the 42nd minute for berlin but the hosts restored parity with hertha goalkeeper christian fiedler gifting a goal to gerald asamoah after 50 minutes .
schalke pushed for another goal but came undone on the counter attack with angolan nando rafael -lrb- 71 -rrb- and niko kovac -lrb- 83 -rrb- on target .
champs falter bremen failed to take advantage of the schalke slip , playing out a 2-2 draw with leverkusen at the weserstadion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2004 strong euro sparks export fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is riding high the euro is climbing from strength to strength .
on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ? no sooner had the german economy surmounted the latest dramatic climb in oil prices , than it was forced to face a new demon in the shape of a stubbornly strong euro .
the fearful have responded in a chorus of woeful lament , predicting a rise in the price of german exports , and a subsequent fall in demand thereof .
and because the slight upward turn in the ailing economy has been almost exclusively thanks to germany 's exporters , the fear is that such a shift could plunge germany right back into recession . this , however , is not just a german problem , but a european one , to which the president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , jean-claude trichet , paid testimony with words of unusual gravity .
" it is a brutal , most unwelcome appreciation , " he said .
yet trichet 's concern is not so much the present exchange rate as the phenomenon of fluctuation in the common currency .
such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2004 strong euro sparks export fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is riding high the euro is climbing from strength to strength .
on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ? no sooner had the german economy surmounted the latest dramatic climb in oil prices , than it was forced to face a new demon in the shape of a stubbornly strong euro .
the fearful have responded in a chorus of woeful lament , predicting a rise in the price of german exports , and a subsequent fall in demand thereof .
and because the slight upward turn in the ailing economy has been almost exclusively thanks to germany 's exporters , the fear is that such a shift could plunge germany right back into recession . this , however , is not just a german problem , but a european one , to which the president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , jean-claude trichet , paid testimony with words of unusual gravity .
" it is a brutal , most unwelcome appreciation , " he said .
yet trichet 's concern is not so much the present exchange rate as the phenomenon of fluctuation in the common currency .
such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .

this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "
nevertheless she believes that russia will become a member within the next few years - and that , for the europeans , would be an important development , not only from a political but also from an economical point of view . karin kails -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ratifies kyoto protocol russia 's parliament ratified the un climate accord friday in a historic vote that virtually guarantees the treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions will finally enter into force seven years after its creation .

wins for leaders wolfsburg and bayern munich , who were fourth before the action this weekend , defeats for schalke 04 and stuttgart , second and third respectively , and a draw for the champions werder bremen in fifth meant that the top two teams on sunday evening had earned themselves some breathing space .
bayern moved up to second , one point adrift of wolfsburg , thanks to rising peruvian star paulo guerrero who proved to be the bavarians ' knight in shining armor , scoring twice in five minutes to help his team to a 3-1 win at vfl bochum on sunday .
guerrero , 20 , came on for compatriot claudio pizarro at half-time and had a huge impact equalizing in the 76th minute and then scoring again on 81 minutes .
an own goal from christoph preuss sixty seconds later meant bochum , who had led through vratislav lokvenc 's 66th minute opener , had thrown the match away conceding three goals in six hectic minutes .
bildunterschrift : despite the victory bayern general manager uli hoeness was angry about criticism of how munich played .
" when we have to justify a 3-1 win away from home it is time to give up , " explained hoeness .
" i want people to accept our performances for what they are - they are good . "
wolves consolidate lead at the top surprise package wolfsburg remain on top of the bundesliga following a comfortable 3-0 home win over vfb stuttgart on sunday .
the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , stay at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1 reverse against hertha berlin .
" tactically that was our best performance of the season , " said a delighted wolves boss erik gerets .
" we would not be able to beat a team such as stuttgart without such tactical nous . "
bildunterschrift : since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on september 18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
wolves were demolished 5-1 by stuttgart at home last season but took revenge with a 3-0 win .
goals from thomas brdaric -lrb- 42 -rrb- and martin petrov -lrb- 69 , 76 -rrb- completed a miserable week for stuttgart who crashed out of the german cup to bayern on wednesday .
royal blues slip up in shock defeat schalke 04 were looking to keep the pressure up on the wolves from their second place berth before saturday 's clash with hertha berlin .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
a capacity 61,500 crowd at the arena auf schalke watched schalke 's record run of six successive wins come to an end .
german international gerald asamoah cancelled out brazilian marcelinho 's opener for berlin but schalke then came undone on the counter attack .
angolan nando rafael -lrb- 71 -rrb- and niko kovac -lrb- 83 -rrb- landed the sucker punches for berlin .
german champions werder bremen missed the chance to close in on the pretenders to their crown with a 2-2 draw against bayer leverkusen .
werder are now six points adrift of wolves back in sixth place .
champs blow chance to take advantage bildunterschrift : bremen failed to take advantage of the schalke slip to move back into contention despite being in a commanding position at the weserstadion .
" i can not fathom how we gave away the initiative in the space of 10 minutes , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we were too slow for both their goals and were punished . "
bayer turned the game on its head in the second half with ukraine international andrei voronin equalizing in the 51st minute and 120 seconds later leverkusen were in front .
bremen 's paraguayan supersub nelson haedo valdez salvaged a point with his 72nd minute leveler but werder have some work to do to force their way back into the title race .
dortmund 's woes increase elsewhere borussia dortmund , with an injury list totaling 14 players , fell to a 1-0 defeat at kaiserslautern .
ferydoon zandi scored from the spot after 71 minutes to pull dortmund back into the relegation battle .
" the 17-year-old marc kruska was our best player .
that says it all , " fumed dortmund chief bert van marwijk .
hansa rostock remain bottom of the league and must now search for a new coach after a 6-0 home thrashing by sv hamburg on sunday .

on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ? no sooner had the german economy surmounted the latest dramatic climb in oil prices , than it was forced to face a new demon in the shape of a stubbornly strong euro .
the fearful have responded in a chorus of woeful lament , predicting a rise in the price of german exports , and a subsequent fall in demand thereof .
and because the slight upward turn in the ailing economy has been almost exclusively thanks to germany 's exporters , the fear is that such a shift could plunge germany right back into recession . this , however , is not just a german problem , but a european one , to which the president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , jean-claude trichet , paid testimony with words of unusual gravity .
" it is a brutal , most unwelcome appreciation , " he said .
yet trichet 's concern is not so much the present exchange rate as the phenomenon of fluctuation in the common currency .
such volatility creates an insecurity to which markets react in a highly allergic fashion . weak dollar takes the wrap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strong rate is showing no signs of abating the pundits have been quick to point the finger of blame at the weak dollar , and america 's so-called twin deficit .
on the one hand , there is a $ 413 billion -lrb- € 534 -rrb- hole in the us finance minister 's budget , where just four years ago there was a plus of $ 200 billion .
moreover , the weak dollar is the product of a current account deficit .
america consumes considerably more goods and services than it produces , which means it needs a huge daily influx of foreign capital .
so in order to counteract the trend , the guardians of the dollar are backing the weak currency , raising interest rates in order to curb consumption .
but it ’ s the europeans who pay the price . that said , europe should n't complain too loudly , because a weak dollar also has its advantages , not least that of diluting the consequences of high oil prices , which are traditionally in dollars .
and ultimately , the high euro exchange rate is a kind of accolade for the young currency , which is gaining popularity as a reserve currency in the vaults of national banks in countries such as thailand , malaysia and china .
in world trade terms , the euro has already become a more major player than the dollar . europe should act however , there is no escaping the negative ramifications of the strong euro for german companies .
for every cent the euro increases in value , german chemical giant basf , for example , loses € 120 million in turnover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar is currently weak given the improbability that america will succumb to feelings of sympathy and consequently slam on the emergency brakes , it 's up to the europeans to take action .
the recipe is as simple as it is complex .
lower taxes , investment support and reformed labor markets would all stimulate the necessary growth .
yet such processes are slow , so the custodians of the euro should consider intervening through the foreign exchange markets in a bid to temporarily strengthen the dollar and alarm the speculators .
that aside , a little more calm could go a long way , because in reality not every new market record has to spell immediate calamity for the world economy . henrik böhme -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar the euro jumped to a record high against the dollar on friday following us president george w. bush 's re-election .
investors fear the us might have trouble attracting enough capital to cover its massive trade deficit .

this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "

this week , a working group of around 60 countries is meeting again to discuss russia 's accession to the wto . in order for any new country to join the world trade organization , every one of the current 148 wto members has to agree .
that 's one of the factors facing russia this week as its accession to the wto is discussed by a working group of 60 nations .
there are some hard negotiations ahead , for example with the united states , which is demanding stronger protection of copyright in russia in the battle against music and video piracy .
the russian federation has already taken a big step forward towards membership of the wto .
in may , russia came to an agreement with the european union .
" signing a bilateral agreement with eu is quite something because it means signing an agreement with 25 members , " said fabien delcrois , who represents the eu at the wto . " but it does not mean that you will get the consensus of the others and it doesn ’ t mean that we don ’ t have still have some problems to solve with the russians . "
a step towards membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu and russian negotiations were hard but productive .
the negotiations between the eu and russia were long and hard .
some say that russia gave in by agreeing to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change .
others say that the eu gave in because it initially wanted russia to extend the eu-russia partnership to include the new eu members who joined in may , a development russia views with suspicion , as many of the new members are former soviet states .
delcrois says that russia is on the right track , but that the eu will carefully watch the implementation of internal reforms in the country .
" basically everything is in the hands of russia . " he said .
" what is sure is that since the arrival of president putin in power we have observed an increased commitment .
and an intensification of the internal reforms in russia has helped a lot in accelerating the process " us stumbling blocks even though the agreement with the eu constitutes major progress , some obstacles remain .
there are two main issues to be resolved in negotiations with the united states in particular .
the us wants to see better protection of intellectual property in russia , and a different framework for the service and telecommunication market .
xenia udayeva , who works for the carnegie center think tank in washington , believes that both sides have to compromise .
but she also points out that russia is an oil exporter , and is therefore not as dependent on wto membership as other countries are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for russia , becoming a member of the wto is not that big and i guess this is why the negotiations are taking so long because russia is not that eager to become a member , " she said .
" it wants to become a member because everybody else is a member , but it wo n't have that many benefits . "
nevertheless she believes that russia will become a member within the next few years - and that , for the europeans , would be an important development , not only from a political but also from an economical point of view . karin kails -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia ratifies kyoto protocol russia 's parliament ratified the un climate accord friday in a historic vote that virtually guarantees the treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions will finally enter into force seven years after its creation .

his foreign secretary jack straw added to the compliments , saying it " had been a joy to work " with powell .
“ i am confident that whoever president bush appoints to succeed secretary powell will be somebody with whom the uk government will be able to work very closely and with whom i will be able swiftly to have a good working relationship , ” said straw .
fischer 's close friend the former four-star general was widely perceived as the bush administration cabinet member most sympathetic to european views .
in his book " plan of attack " , journalist bob woodward depicted powell as the person in bush 's foreign policy team most critical of the administration 's march towards a military invasion of iraq , something that endeared him to european opponents of the war . german foreign minister joschka fischer considered powell a close friend as well as a colleague .
speaking to reporters following powell 's resignation , fischer said the secretary was a man who understood germany very well , from his time here as a soldier .
despite policy differences between the two countries , fischer said he never found it difficult to communicate with his counterpart .

the three points saw wolfsburg , only promoted to the bundesliga in 1997 , open up a three-point lead at the summit as second-placed schalke 04 slipped to a 3-1reverse against hertha berlin .
however , bayern munich can move to within one point of wolfsburg with all three points at vfl bochum on sunday .
under ralf rangnick , schalke had won six league matches in a row but it was unlucky seven as hertha triumphed 3-1 at the arena auf schalke - their first victory in gelsenkirchen since 1970 .
german champions werder bremen missed the chance to close in on the pretenders to their crown with a 2-2 draw against bayer leverkusen .
werder are now six points adrift of wolves back in sixth place .
since wolfsburg reached the bundesliga summit on sept .
18 , everyone has been asking how long it would be before the unfashionable outfit slipped down the ladder .
but a 3-0 triumph over stuttgart at the volkswagen arena helped the wolves have the honor of leading the german standings for another week .
petrov steals the show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's martin petrov showed world class quality when finishing two individual goals .
the wolves were demolished 5-1 by stuttgart at home last season but surged into a 42nd minute lead through thomas brdaric .
some poor defending was pivotal to the goal and this theme continued in the 69th minute when martin petrov walzed around markus babbel to rifle past timo hildebrand .
the bulgarian attacker grabbed his second in the 76th minute to complete a miserable week for stuttgart who crashed out of the german cup to bayern on wednesday .
a capacity 61,500 crowd at the arena auf schalke watched schalke 's record run of six successive wins come to an end as hertha ran out 3-1 winners .
brazilian marcelinho opened the scoring in the 42nd minute for berlin but the hosts restored parity with hertha goalkeeper christian fiedler gifting a goal to gerald asamoah after 50 minutes .
schalke pushed for another goal but came undone on the counter attack with angolan nando rafael -lrb- 71 -rrb- and niko kovac -lrb- 83 -rrb- on target .
champs falter bremen failed to take advantage of the schalke slip , playing out a 2-2 draw with leverkusen at the weserstadion .
miroslav klose was rested in midweek and showed his sharpness with an instinctive strike in the 19th minute after bayer goalkeeper hans jorg butt had fumbled a cross .
but bayer turned the game on its head in the second half with ukraine international andrei voronin equalizing in the 51st minute , and 120 seconds later leverkusen were in front .
bulgarian international dimitar berbatov , who had hit the post in the first half , took advantage of some invisible marking to head in a corner from the right .
bremen 's paraguayan supersub nelson haedo valdez salavaged a point with his 72nd-minute leveller , but werder have some work to do to force their way back into the title race .
elsewhere borussia dortmund , with an injury list totalling 14 players , fell to a 1-0 defeat at kaiserslautern .
ferydoon zandi scored from the spot after 71 minutes to pull dortmund back into the relegation battle . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top teams meet in title showdowns on the 13th match day in the bundesliga , the title contenders have the opportunity to send messages to their nearest rivals .

should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? europe battles english invasion deutsch please , we 're german europe -pipe- 15.11.2004 opinion : desperately ditching denglish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the us fast food chain is switching to german and lovin ' it after several misguided years of using bad english to woo customers , german advertisers have apparently rediscovered their own language .
it may not help ailing retailers much , but limiting silly denglish is long overdue . native english-speakers are often impressed when they come to germany .
despite their monoglot tendencies , there are still plenty of people that understand them here .
many germans often wow the british with perfect received pronunciation and americans are always floored when someone from düsseldorf sounds like they 're from des moines , iowa . without a doubt most germans have a better grasp of english than the french , greeks and spanish .
but compared to the dutch or scandinavians , the average german 's command of the language of shakespeare and " sex and the city " frequently can leave much to be desired .
the clearest evidence of this is the recent move by major german advertisers to back away from using english slogans . unlike the french , who religiously guard against the invasion of foreign -lrb- read english -rrb- words , germans have embraced anglo terms and phrases with almost careless abandon in recent years .
this has lead to the advent of the horribly silly denglish -lrb- deutsch + english -rrb- , which has become far too popular with many germans . calling a mobile phone a " handy " or going online in order to " chatten " with friends is , of course , harmless .
the problem starts when english words are used where there are perfectly good german alternatives .
for example , there is absolutely no need to use the denglish verb " updaten " when " aktualisieren " will work just fine . but far worse than pseudo-important individuals peppering their speech with unnecessary anglicisms is when companies adopt the annoying habit .
germany 's former state monopoly telephone company deutsche telekom was rightfully skewered for at one point listing national phone calls on its bills as " german calls " and local ones as " city calls . "
naturally , 86-year-old grandmothers in deepest bavaria were perplexed . thankfully , big ad firms have apparently come to the conclusion that the vast majority of teutons have real problems understanding their often ham-handed attempts to use english .
and some marketing guru somewhere has fortunately realized that adding confusion to a brand is n't a great marketing strategy in a country plagued by a dreadful climate in the retail and advertising sectors . remembering german the market research outfit dialego discovered earlier this year that the top seven most recognized ad slogans for german companies were , perhaps unsurprisingly to anyone except the country 's ad execs , in german .
whether that study alone was enough to set off alarm bells for copywriters from hamburg to munich is unclear .
but the trend back to german slogans is undeniable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers at douglas perfume stores were coming in and finding their way back out again - true to its slogan " come in and find out " the latest conversion back to good old deutsch is the douglas chain of perfume shops .
perhaps because of its english sounding name , the german company for years has bewildered its customers with the slogan " come in and find out . "
sadly , the majority of germans thought the scent peddlers were asking them to come into the store and find their way out again . the company germanized the pronunciation of its name long ago .
it 's spoken " dooglass " here .
now they 've at least decided to be consistent , picking a german advertising motto .
instead of giving their customers directions , the company is " making life prettier " with " douglas macht das leben schöner . " douglas ' retreat from english to the mother tongue follows the example of other big name german firms including lufthansa , utilities giant rwe and the television channel sat1 , which used to claim it was " powered by emotion . "
unfortunately , that sounded to a lot of germans like a direct translation of the nazi recreation slogan " kraft durch freude . " oddly it was the quintessentially american company , mcdonald 's , that led the way back to german by ditching " every time a good time " for " ich liebe es , " which is analogous to their us slogan " i 'm lovin ' it .

islanders gave their comments as part of a study carried out by the environment department .
currently , each parish in jersey makes its own arrangements for rubbish collection and recycling .
but the environment department is inviting all constables to meet to see how they can work together to improve the system .
in september , the department asked for comments on a discussion document about how jersey 's waste should be tackled .
issues raised included health concerns of residents in bellozanne over emissions from the nearby waste-to-energy plant .
they also included the funding of waste solutions and the possibility of exporting jersey 's waste to france or having a joint scheme with guernsey .
jersey currently recycles about 9 % of combustible and biodegradable waste .
this falls short of some european countries with figures of14 % .

busted were converted to the band aid cause the recording studio was packed with some of the uk 's most popular artists and was a celebration of britain 's musical talent .
but it was not a day of glamour , egos or schmoozing , and they were told in no uncertain terms the day was not about them .
bob geldof made sure of that .
if any stars had a tenuous grip on reality , geldof brought them down to earth with a jolt , leaving most - from joss stone to the darkness frontman justin hawkins - in tears .
famine just before they got together for the group photo , geldof decided to play them a 20-year-old video of the ethiopian famine .
it was the most moving video from live aid , showing dying refugees in 1984 , and has lost none of its power .
stone , the 17-year-old soul sensation , was aghast throughout , mouth gaping and hand helplessly held against her face .
will young recorded two lines with jamelia other superstars who are used to the world revolving around them were also in the huddle , equally rapt and upset .
geldof , who knows how to tug the heartstrings , then introduced a woman from the wings who was seen as a starving child at the end of the video .
it was too much for some artists and there will be many red eyes in the group photo that followed .
it was a wake-up call to some young singers that their influence and responsibilities stretch beyond the record shops .
overdue and 20 years after the original , it was an overdue reminder to the rest that there is still a world outside their windows .
at the start of the day , stone - who was not born when the original song came out - mistakenly called geldof " gandalf " and james bourne from busted did not recognise the man who started it all .
but by the end , the young stars were won over and busted were saying they wanted to show the band aid logo and video on tour .
" cool or uncool - what does that mean on a sunday morning when you have n't shaved and your make-up is still dripping from the night before ? "
geldof asked .
" if you can sing like a voice from god , who cares , cool or uncool ?
spare me .
rock or pop - so ?
all that goes and it just becomes a bunch of people on a sunday morning noodling about the place . "
everyone can get a bit excited and carried away recording the song heidi range sugababes geldof has a certain way of getting his message across , making stars an offer they can not refuse .
he basically tells them if they do not take part , and help raise money for famine relief , they are directly responsible for the deaths of other people .

busted were converted to the band aid cause the recording studio was packed with some of the uk 's most popular artists and was a celebration of britain 's musical talent .
but it was not a day of glamour , egos or schmoozing , and they were told in no uncertain terms the day was not about them .
bob geldof made sure of that .
if any stars had a tenuous grip on reality , geldof brought them down to earth with a jolt , leaving most - from joss stone to the darkness frontman justin hawkins - in tears .
famine just before they got together for the group photo , geldof decided to play them a 20-year-old video of the ethiopian famine .
it was the most moving video from live aid , showing dying refugees in 1984 , and has lost none of its power .
stone , the 17-year-old soul sensation , was aghast throughout , mouth gaping and hand helplessly held against her face .
will young recorded two lines with jamelia other superstars who are used to the world revolving around them were also in the huddle , equally rapt and upset .
geldof , who knows how to tug the heartstrings , then introduced a woman from the wings who was seen as a starving child at the end of the video .
it was too much for some artists and there will be many red eyes in the group photo that followed .
it was a wake-up call to some young singers that their influence and responsibilities stretch beyond the record shops .
overdue and 20 years after the original , it was an overdue reminder to the rest that there is still a world outside their windows .
at the start of the day , stone - who was not born when the original song came out - mistakenly called geldof " gandalf " and james bourne from busted did not recognise the man who started it all .
but by the end , the young stars were won over and busted were saying they wanted to show the band aid logo and video on tour .
" cool or uncool - what does that mean on a sunday morning when you have n't shaved and your make-up is still dripping from the night before ? "
geldof asked .
" if you can sing like a voice from god , who cares , cool or uncool ?
spare me .
rock or pop - so ?
all that goes and it just becomes a bunch of people on a sunday morning noodling about the place . "
everyone can get a bit excited and carried away recording the song heidi range sugababes geldof has a certain way of getting his message across , making stars an offer they can not refuse .
he basically tells them if they do not take part , and help raise money for famine relief , they are directly responsible for the deaths of other people .
his achievement in getting such a stellar line-up together 20 years ago was more impressive because this time , most of the current stars were eager to take part .
