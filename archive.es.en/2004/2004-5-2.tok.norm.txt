as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .

both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .

" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .
" whatever the case , germany will not take part in it .
the army will only provide special aircraft to transport wounded if this proves necessary .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .
" whatever the case , germany will not take part in it .
the army will only provide special aircraft to transport wounded if this proves necessary .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .
in the meantime , eu interpreters will be faced with the daunting task of translating accession into 380 official language combinations - that is until maltese is spoken in brussels . sophie nicholson in valletta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maltese bridge between cultures the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may , and some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .

instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .

both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .
" whatever the case , germany will not take part in it .
the army will only provide special aircraft to transport wounded if this proves necessary .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .

not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .

so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .

both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .
in the meantime , eu interpreters will be faced with the daunting task of translating accession into 380 official language combinations - that is until maltese is spoken in brussels . sophie nicholson in valletta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maltese bridge between cultures the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may , and some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world .

the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .

as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .
in the meantime , eu interpreters will be faced with the daunting task of translating accession into 380 official language combinations - that is until maltese is spoken in brussels . sophie nicholson in valletta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maltese bridge between cultures the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may , and some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .

not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .
in the meantime , eu interpreters will be faced with the daunting task of translating accession into 380 official language combinations - that is until maltese is spoken in brussels . sophie nicholson in valletta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maltese bridge between cultures the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may , and some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .

according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .
" whatever the case , germany will not take part in it .
the army will only provide special aircraft to transport wounded if this proves necessary .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .

german defense minister peter struck calls for shortening the length of military missions abroad and removing guards from u.s. bases by the end of the year in order to save money . the german military , the bundeswehr , has more troops deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad than any country apart from the united states .
from kosovo to afghanistan and the horn of africa , some 7,700 german soldiers participate in international security forces .
but the country is undergoing massive cost-cutting reforms , and the finance ministry has targeted the defense department as one of the areas where the government needs to cut back .
according to the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper , struck plans to shorten the length of missions abroad .
" we will reduce the duration of international missions from six months to four months in the second half of the year , " he said on sunday .
the minister , however , resisted plans to trim down defense spending even more .
" the finance minister wants to push through budget reforms in all areas , but i can not accept that , " he was quoted in the newspaper .
the defense ministry 's current finance plan is based on an annual budget of € 24.2 billion euros , of which only € 1.15 billion went towards underwriting foreign deployments in 2003 .
cutting that amount even further would jeopardize several international missions , to which the bundeswehr has pledged itself , struck argued .
no more protection of u.s. bases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol outside the u.s. air base at rhein-main near frankfurt .
instead of withdrawing itself from its international military commitments such as the international fight against terrorism , the minister proposed terminating the protection of u.s. military installations in germany .
since the start of the war in iraq last january , around 2,500 german soldiers have been providing guard duty for 100 u.s. bases throughout the country .
" at the end of the year , we want to stop the german federal armed forces guarding american military bases , " struck told the newspaper , adding that negotiations were already underway for ending the policing process .
the u.s. defense department is currently studying a " base realignment and closure " program aimed at relocating installations around the world so the pentagon can react quickly to new military threats .
under the plans , a number of bases are likely to close in germany as tens of thousands of troops leave the country , probably for central and eastern europe .
euro 2004 and olympics still safe germany will still participate in security missions to protect the european soccer championships in portugal this june and the olympics in greece in august .
both countries had appealed to nato to provide military assistance in protecting the events from possible terror attacks .
germany 's contribution will be primarily limited to patrolling the air space , for which the german air force will send troops .
as to the question of german involvement in iraq , struck unconditionally rejected sending troops .
even if nato is asked to participate in a prospective security force once the u.s.-led coalition transfers sovereignty to an iraqi government at the end of june , the minister said germany would not be a part of it .
" it seems highly uncertain if and when nato will be asked for support , " struck said .
" whatever the case , germany will not take part in it .
the army will only provide special aircraft to transport wounded if this proves necessary .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . when the european union opened its doors to 10 new members on may 1 , it increased the number of official languages from 11 to 20 .
the eu is the only international organization in which all participants can speak in their own language and know that everything will be translated correctly .
in fact brussels is the place to be for foreign language fans and professional translators .
each language entering the eu is due to hire an extra 60 translators , and with a total cost estimated at over 800 million euros , translating and interpreting is a big part of daily business in brussels .
but for the mediterranean island of malta , it 's a job just trying to find enough people who can do the translation work .
looking for maltese translators maltese , the island nation 's official language , is a mixture of old phoenician and arabic with a mingling of italian and french words .
for the majority of europeans , the ancient language with semitic roots is difficult to understand .
and compared to the other nine accession countries , malta 's language is spoken by a relatively small population : only about 400,000 people live in malta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro eu supporters wave european union and national flags during a rally in st. andrews , malta , on march 6 , 2003 .
malta 's citizens voted in favor of entering in the european union .
for this reason , the people involved in preparing the country for entry in the eu were excited to have maltese accepted as an official language .
not all the regional and minority languages spoken in europe are recognized as official eu languages .
carmel atald , acting director of the maltese eu information center , explained that because malta is small and joining a big economic bloc , many " fear a loss of identity . "
it 's important for the government " to negotiate and obtain maltese as an official language , " he said .
but by the time the government in valletta had achieved official status for maltese , it was too late to train enough qualified translators and interpreters by may 1 , 2004 .
the island had no school for translators because there had never been a need for it .
english , malta 's other official language , is just as widely spoken as the local one .
adding another language to brussels a university translation course was finally set up last october .
vanni bruno , head of the island 's translation unit , had been working overtime to be ready for accession .
" yes , we do have problems ; it was a bit late , " he admitted .
" we hope to keep to certain milestone target dates .
if we do n't it will be very embarrassing , " he said looking towards a more multi-lingual future for the island .
meanwhile , the translation unit has offered to provide freelance translators in malta until there are people available to fill jobs in brussels .
so far there are only a handful of maltese interpreters .
none of the current eu translators speak maltese because there is no one to teach the language .
eu officials are downplaying the problem .
on a recent visit to valletta , the vice president of the european commission , neil kinnock , told the maltese that their multi-lingualism will help them to train translators quickly .
" what has been represented in some quarters as a major source of difficulty , is a technical problem , " he said and expressed confidence that the problem would be overcome , " not by may 1 , but over a couple of years . "
linguistic pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese flags hang in the republic street in valletta while the rush to train linguists continues , some people are looking ahead to the benefits of maltese being recognized as an official european language .
kenneth gambin from malta 's heritage organization said many maltese still see their native tongue as a dialect .
he 's setting up a museum of maltese language to change attitudes towards it .
" we 've received good press for the museum , " he said , " probably because it 's an official eu language . "
it helps them to be " proud , " where they might normally have an " ambiguous feeling to it , or be afraid to use it . "
other academics are concerned about the increasing tendency to mix maltese and english words to the detriment of both languages .
maltese novelist and poet , oliver friggieri , hopes that the eu will help to preserve linguistic variety .
" europe has to impose self-respect and self-discipline and laws .
if brussels insists , then the future of small languages is guaranteed .
if left to individual countries , greater forces will prevail , " and language diversity will be lost , he said .
in the meantime , eu interpreters will be faced with the daunting task of translating accession into 380 official language combinations - that is until maltese is spoken in brussels . sophie nicholson in valletta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maltese bridge between cultures the tiny mediterranean island state with its own language joins the eu in may , and some hope it will serve as a bridge between europe and the arab world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2004 new eu needs to go green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raimo pirksaar , 26 , says estonia needs to develop renewable energy sources .
as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy . engineer raimo pirksaar is on his way to estonia 's sole wind energy park on the country 's west coast .
only three wind turbines are in operation , but it 's a start .
under eu directives estonia needs to increase its share of renewable energy to 5.1 percent by the year 2005 .
it currently stands at just one percent .
wind energy is expected to make up at least one third of that figure , says pirksaar .
estonia 's coastline is blessed with a continual strong breeze and several large wind energy plants are already being planned .
measuring the benefits of alternative energy the 26-year-old engineer , who is researching the impact of wind energy on estonia 's power grid , says it is important to determine how electricity generated from different types of turbines effects the outdated grid system .
models vary in quality and older ones especially can cause problems for the weak grid , says pirksaar , who hopes his measurements will show how many turbines the state-run electricity system can safely manage .
but there 's another problem .
wind is not a continuous , non-stop source of electricity , and the supply gap can hardly be filled by estonia 's obsolete power plants which run on oil shale .
" sometimes there 's a strong wind , sometimes there is n't , so the turbines are n't producing power all the time , and the oil shale plants ca n't pick up the slack so quickly , " pirksaar explains .
" it takes hours to either boost or scale down output .
that 's the problem . "
rethinking estonia 's power supply oil shale is estonia 's main power source and has rendered the country practically self-sufficient in the energy sector , but it also has the negative side effects of carbon dioxide and other toxic emissions .
according to eu environmental guidelines , to which estonia now must also adhere , these greenhouse gases have to be drastically reduced by the year 2005 .
a major step towards this goal is the modernization of the soviet-era power plants .
up in the north of the country , along the estonian-russian border , near the town of narva , the state power supplier eesti energia has taken the initiative and launched a new program to reduce emissions .
valdur lahtvee , environmental manager of the utility giant and co-founder of estonia 's green movement says that 10 million tons of oil shale are burned annually in energy production , but only less than a third is actually suitable for energy use .
the rest ends up as ash mixed with water on dump sites .
" it 's the environment that suffers .
the estonians are working on it , harnessing the latest in power plant technolgy , " lahtvee says .
and so far the plant in narva has managed to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 percent .
it 's a figure he 's proud of : " new technology enhances efficiency and productivity from 28 to 36 percent , and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide . "
eesti energia has plans on the drafting table to convert smaller plants from oil shale to biomass-based energy suppliers .
but so far such goals are still a ways off in the future .
reserves of biomass , such as wood waste and sawdust , are found in abundance in a country so full of forests as estonia .
the alternative energy source , however , has hardly been exploited for mass power supply .
only on the individual level , in a few small villages such as avirnurme in central estonia , has biomass been used to provide heat for the residents by using modern technology to burn wood waste .
raimo pirksaar hopes estonia will look to such smaller examples for a nationwide energy plan and begin investing more in the study and harnessing of renewable energy sources for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the green light the ten candidate countries joining the european union in may face a daunting list of environmental requirements that must be met as stipulated in the bloc 's membership criteria .

jackie , like many people , took the view that a visit from a hospital chaplain meant little more than a kind word of comfort with a christian message .
" in the past i went out of my way to avoid the god squad , " she said .
however , jackie had n't expected the thoroughly modern approach to hospital chaplaincy adopted by reverend chris johnson and his multi-faith team .
chris saw me as a person and not as a patient jackie hill " chris was there when i needed advice , " she said .
" he helped me to structure my thoughts .
he was n't judgmental and i did n't feel pushed .
" he allowed me to come to my own conclusions .
" it 's very important when you 're a patient to have someone supporting you who is not from the medical side .
" when you spend a lot of time in hospital , like i did , you can be seen through your illness .
chris saw me as a person and not as a patient .
" it was n't about chris telling me about how i should feel about my illness , it was more about him just being there to listen .
" it was having a regular visitor who became a friend that helped me to recover by encouraging me to see for myself how i wanted to get better . "
jackie admits that her life has now been transformed by the support she received in hospital .
" i 've been on the visitors course run by the chaplaincy and i 'm now about to help others , " she said .
multi-faith approach as the chaplaincy manager of bradford teaching hospitals nhs trust , chris johnson leads a team of eight chaplains that represent the christian , muslim , sikh and hindu faiths .
" the chaplaincy is about seeing people as people and not in religious terms .
primarily i have a spiritual responsibility and therefore respect anyone 's belief or culture , " he said .
" together with all nhs staff we have to show respect for the religious , spiritual and cultural needs of everyone in the hospital . "
last november the department of health launched guidance for nhs trusts on chaplaincy services in response to the religious diversity of the communities that the nhs serves .
" one way of doing this is for multi-faith support and guidance to be available to today 's multi-cultural and spiritually diverse patients and staff , " said chief nursing officer sarah mullally .
" we see nhs chaplaincy services as offering an important component in the key policy area of improving the patient experience . "
chris johnson has been a hospital chaplain for seven years , but has worked closely with urban communities in west yorkshire for 30 years .
he is aware that he is part of a new breed of health care professionals .
" the professional label wo n't officially come in for a couple of years , " he says , " but we are now better trained and offer a 24 hour service . "
training chaplaincy volunteers is an important part of building an effective team .
sympathetic approach people working for the chaplaincy provide facilities for prayer and raise cultural awareness among staff , but for many people it 's the support they provide in times of bereavement that is invaluable .
" my mother was given a few hours to live and chris johnson came to see me , " said christopher ingleby .
it 's about just being there and listening rev chris johnson " he was very sympathetic , had time for me , and told me i could keep in touch .
" i did n't have a vicar at the time so chris conducted the funeral service .
we 've kept in touch ever since . "
it is the inter-denominational nature of the hospital chaplaincy in bradford that chris johnson is particularly pleased about .
he values the way religions work together : " we 're a good example to the outside world of an ecumenical approach . "
one thing that a modern chaplaincy has dispensed with is the wearing of religious garments .
this is all part of making the chaplaincy service non-threatening .
" we do n't want to set the agenda , " said mr johnson .
" we work from what people want out of us .
we certainly do n't evangelise .
" we offer counselling and support .
it 's about just being there and listening .
and this is a service we offer to staff as well . "

" the kingdom will eliminate terrorism no matter how long it takes , " said crown prince abdullah .
the gunmen killed two americans , two britons , an australian and a saudi national guard .
security forces pursued and shot dead all four attackers , who had fled the scene , the authorities said .
the attack took place at offices just outside a petrochemical plant partly owned by the us firm exxon-mobil .
saudi arabia said three of the gunmen worked at the site and used their entry passes to gain access , sneaking the fourth attacker in with them .
australia has said al-qaeda was probably behind the attack .
" al-qaeda people are very active in saudi arabia , where one of al-qaeda 's key objectives is the overthrow of the regime , " foreign affairs minister alexander downer told an australian tv station on sunday .
one " could safely assume " the islamic militant network was involved , he said .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said he was " shocked and sickened " by what he called an act of terrorism .
the us ambassador to saudi arabia , james c oberwetter , said he appreciated " everything the saudi authorities -lsb- were -rsb- doing to fight terrorism " .
' evil rampage ' the interior ministry said three foreigners - an american , a canadian and a pakistani - were also wounded in saturday 's attack .
an official quoted by the state news agency denied reports that the body of one dead foreigner had been dragged through the streets by the attackers .
saudi arabia 's ambassador to britain , prince turki al-faisal , described the attack as " an indiscriminate evil rampage " .
four of the westerners killed were working for swedish-swiss engineering giant abb .
the fifth was sub-contracted to work for it .
saudi arabia has seen a year-long wave of islamist militancy , targeting mainly foreigners .
more than 50 people have been killed in suicide bombings in the capital riyadh , including an attack on a security building last month but this is the first known attack by anti-western groups on an oil facility in saudi arabia .
yanbu , together with jubail , is home to much of the kingdom 's oil-refining and petrochemicals industries .
are you in saudi arabia ?
send us your reaction to the gunmen 's attack in yanbu .
such attacks must be condemned .
foreigners are like guests in our countries and they are not involved in crimes like war , etc .
but at the same time , the us should think about its policies , not to be hard on muslims .
instead they should make good relations with muslim countries .

" the kingdom will eliminate terrorism no matter how long it takes , " said crown prince abdullah .
the gunmen killed two americans , two britons , an australian and a saudi national guard .
security forces pursued and shot dead all four attackers , who had fled the scene , the authorities said .
the attack took place at offices just outside a petrochemical plant partly owned by the us firm exxon-mobil .
saudi arabia said three of the gunmen worked at the site and used their entry passes to gain access , sneaking the fourth attacker in with them .
australia has said al-qaeda was probably behind the attack .
" al-qaeda people are very active in saudi arabia , where one of al-qaeda 's key objectives is the overthrow of the regime , " foreign affairs minister alexander downer told an australian tv station on sunday .
one " could safely assume " the islamic militant network was involved , he said .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said he was " shocked and sickened " by what he called an act of terrorism .
the us ambassador to saudi arabia , james c oberwetter , said he appreciated " everything the saudi authorities -lsb- were -rsb- doing to fight terrorism " .

an official quoted by the state news agency denied reports that the body of one dead foreigner had been dragged through the streets by the attackers .
saudi arabia 's ambassador to britain , prince turki al-faisal , described the attack as " an indiscriminate evil rampage " .
four of the westerners killed were working for swedish-swiss engineering giant abb .
the fifth was sub-contracted to work for it .
saudi arabia has seen a year-long wave of islamist militancy , targeting mainly foreigners .
more than 50 people have been killed in suicide bombings in the capital riyadh , including an attack on a security building last month but this is the first known attack by anti-western groups on an oil facility in saudi arabia .
yanbu , together with jubail , is home to much of the kingdom 's oil-refining and petrochemicals industries .

such attacks must be condemned .
foreigners are like guests in our countries and they are not involved in crimes like war , etc .
but at the same time , the us should think about its policies , not to be hard on muslims .
instead they should make good relations with muslim countries .
zain , dubai , uae the attack is not the first and shall certainly not be the last given the significant base for islamic militants in the kingdom , who can remain well hidden given the very closed and private society within which people live here .
in view of the bubble of young disillusioned people coming in to the workplace with little education and no job prospects i can only fear that it will become a lot worse before it gets better .
mark david , al khobar , saudi arabia i thought it was unemployment that caused these terrorist attacks but if three of the attackers were working for the company they attacked it proves that unemployment is not behind terror attacks .

killing in the name - rage against the machine what is your favourite rock riff ?
what makes a great riff ?
bbc news online users sent us their views .
my favourites are plug in baby by muse and requisition by clandestine . both fast moving , energy raising , sweat inducing , heart thumping guitar riffs !
woody , bracknell my favourite riff as got to be by pearl jam .
namely , rearviewmirror , a classic piece of guitar playing by one of the best bands of all time .
although not released , this album track stands out for its brilliant melody and searing lyrics .
if you have n't heard it and want to lose yourself in a hard rock classic , then look no further .
mike traylen , guildford , uk whole lotta love does it for me - extrememly simple , catchy and impossible to ever forget .
it 's a shame that it 's used as the theme tune for a programme that often showcases the worst in manufactured pop !
jon , uk keith richards ' guitar in satisfaction franco nero , middelburg holland frank zappa - watermelon in easterhay .
how can any serious commpendium of classic guitar work not included one of the greatest virtuoso 's of all time .
damien byrne , ireland whilst i appreciate that dire straits are regarded as naff by most rock fans , i would still argue that the main riff from money for nothing -lrb- from the 1985 brothers in arms album -rrb- deserves an entry .
max wurr , stanmore , uk the byrds : 8 miles high .
the start of real rock and psychodelica , mcguinn 's 12 string guitar inspred by george harrison , the byrds were the band that never quite made it although their music still lives on. howard , seoul s. korea plug in baby by muse. its the way it comes out of the intro. excellent stuff .
dan phillips , sheffield , england bombtrack-rage against the machine ! !
there are three parts to this song and all of them are excellent powerful riffs .
its the reason why i picked a guitar in the first place ! !
simon , birmingham lionel ritchie 's ' running with the night ' - the guitar solo at the end of this track is absolutely stunning findlay houliston , glasgow , uk paradise city - guns n ' roses juan , southsea -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction by the rolling stones without a doubt !
apart from being supreme to the others mentioned , it must surely be one of the most recognizable riffs ever .
when richards decided to run his guitar through a gibson fuzz box to create the distortion effect the result was a masterpiece !
kevin , essex i would vote for the human league 's " lebanon " track .
it was a great riff and a departure from their usual electronic sound .
vincent de mello , london " frame by frame " by king crimson because of the insane difficulty .
greg smith , lawrenceville , usa a great riff is - simple and straightforward to play - instantly appealing - one that gets people off their seat in the concert hall .
all right now is my favourite of those in the list , ticks all the boxes !
arthur , colchester , uk a good riff should be made from a short segment of notes or chords , repeated enough to create a great hook but not overplayed so as to be repetative and annoying .
rj , exeter england down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland new zealand down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland , new zealand status quo " whatever you want . "
is great because it gives a feeling of freedom and the open road and it just keeps on going .
ian , wroclaw , poland ex uk how can smells like teen spirit - which does n't even have a riff ! - make number 2 and nothing by the rolling stones get into the list ?
has nobody heard honky tonk women or brown sugar ?
criminal .
frank , cambridge , uk i think voodoo chili by jimi hendrix is the best riff of all time .
not only the music , but the presentation , especially at woodstock , was incredible .
how can you beat a song where the artist plays it with his teeth ?
ben , fairfield , ct , usa i think r.e.m. 's " chronic town -lrb- box cars -rrb- " has the best guitar riffs ever !
clifford speck , trincomalee , sri lanka one riff stands above all others : " satisfaction " by the stones .
after 40 years it still has the power to move one .
mike williams , corpus christi , texas smells like teen spirit at number 2 ?
it 's a joke to pretend they can compare to what the 70s gave us .
and have none of these idiots heard of comfortably numb ?
jeez ...
joshua , kenilworth , england more people ask me to teach them the riff to sweet child o ' mine than any other song , which is impressive when you consider slash -lrb- gnr guitarist -rrb- was only joking around when he first composed it .
although i think riffs can be overplayed in terms of importance , and run the risk of creating novelty music with something to latch onto , it follows on from thematic use in historical music throughout the ages so it 's good to see its survival in modern , popular music .
andy , nottm . , uk there is no doubt that the top 20 here is really special .
i was surprised , however , not to find freebird - lynyrd skynyrd in the list .. the longer version is just awesome .
and its popular too .
cheers .
manish mohan , madras , india superb list , and this is one top 20 that should indeed be based on popularity , not on critics ' sentiments .
hon 'ble mention goes to teenage kicks by the undertones .
miranda , toronto , canada when it comes to great riffs that grab you by the short and curlies then there is no better than toccatta by the legendary sky .
this obviously influenced many apprentice ' axemen ' as plug in baby by muse is a note for note copy .
paul armatage , london , uk what about the searing guitar work of joe walsh in hotel california or that of mark knopfler in sultans of swing - would these not qualify as good riffs ?
a few more that come to mind are those that happened in the doors ' light my fire , led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and badge by cream .
i guess i am old fashoned !
s. lahiri , gaithersburg , md good range in the list , and nice to see plug in baby as a modern classic , but where was 20th century boy by t rex ?
surely that deserves a mention ?
kate , london well , as good as sweet child o mine is , i think the most memorable riff that has lasted the test of time has got to be paranoid by black sabbath .
as soon as those two notes are hit , you instantly know what song it is , incredible .
as a huge muse fan i 'm pleased to see plug in baby in the top 20 , however , muse have done better , namely new born .
but good choices all round in my opinion .
ben , keith richards on satisfaction , honky tonk women , shattered , dancing with mr d , beast of burden , when the whip comes down , gimme shelter , jumpin jack flash , street fighting man , you ca n't always get . , sympathy for the devil , ... aw heck , keith on just about anything and everything .
kudos to pete townsend for the best two note riff of all time on my generation .
bill , gulf breeze , fl usa top 20 riffs without iron maiden ? ?
where were they ?
robert g eggleston , dronfield , derbyshire , england i 'd have like to have seen ' my mamma said ' by lenny kravitz and aggree entirly with damien byrne that ' watermellon in easter hay ' and ' i am the slime ' by god zappa and are sadly missing .
jim gardner , stockton on tees uk plug in baby is the best .
it 's amazing ..
hayley , england what no boston ?
anything from ' third stage ' make me want to get the air guitar out in the street !
simon , uk is it too recent for ' hysteria ' by muse ... or for that matter all of ' absolution ' ? ... that album is something not often achieved - well done muse , maybe next time .
but hey , for now kurt would be turning in his grave if he saw slts at no .
2 - # 1 surely !
row bell , sheffield , uk i agree with most of the list , but to choose rage against the machine 's killing in the name instead of satisfaction by the stones , under the bridge by red hot chili peppers or even flow by pearl jam is in my opinion a big mistake .
carlos kuriyama , new york , usa while i am utterly sick of it , sweet child o ' mine is worthy of topping that list .
layla should 've been a bit higher up i think , and tom morello 's rage against the machine riffery could do with a bit more coverage in the overall chart .
pity that g n ' r lost their touch , eh ...
gareth , nottingham , uk not many people outside of ireland , but dearg doom by horselips .
stompin ' good riff !
aisling tracy , bristol uk deep purple 's classic smoke on the water is memorable for many reasons but the riff of all riffs i think is burn for the pure adrenalin rush that kicks in when it starts .
magic ! !
kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !
michael idoyaga , new orleans , la , usa why is n't ca n't stop there or even under the bridge by the red hot chilis ?
they both have amazing riffs , john fruscianti -lrb- rhcp guitarist -rrb- is a genius , especially in under the bridge. mike dean , london , uk there are so many good ones but " the last time " by jagger / richards is outstanding .
neat , easy , powerful lick .
an inspired piece of riff writing !
chris hunter , bedford , uk sweet child of mine deserves to be number 1 .
my personal favorite would be metallica 's master of puppets , it made to number 7 .
another good one would be iron man by black sabbath , awesome riff !
rami el-akabawi , cairo , egypt where 's " rebel rebel " by david bowie ?
an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .
but , from the list , how can anyone go past " satisfaction " by the stones ?
truly awe-inspiring .
timothy clifford , ex-pat a great riff lets the rest of the song fade into memory while leaving the hook dangling in mind forever .
as the list is missing both dire straits ' " money for nothin " ' and the cult 's " love removal machine " i personally ca n't take it too seriously .
to omit one is folly , but to leave out both is blasphemy !
robert bickers , arlington , texas , usa how total guitar could list the top 20 riffs of all time and not include any andrew ridgley has to be a crime .
i mean , club tropicana , need i say more ... ! daz , texas usa the fact that metallica is the only band that has two songs in the top 10 really says something about this incredibly influential band .
vasco burgos , chile - lives in us joshua , the " idiots " who voted for ' smells like teen spirit ' above ' comfortably numb ' are probably the kind of idiots who know the difference between a guitar riff and a guitar solo .
both are great songs .
but only one of them contains a riff .
iggy , glasgow agree about the rolling stones , adding ' the last time ' ' jumping jack flash ' to the others mentioned peter , london uk ' are you gonna go my way ' by lenny kravitz and ' london calling ' by the clash - two songs perfectly matched with their simple riffs .
in my opinion simplicity is the key .
also - why no pink floyd ? !
is it only me that thinks ' money ' has there the world 's greatest riff ?
it 's not even in the top 20 !
jim doyle , bristol , uk sultans of swing by dire straits has the best riff i can think of .
tom , london , uk nothing by queen , stones or stairway to heaven .
go back to school !
rh , hong kong nothing by the who in the list ?
how about substitute for starters - fantastic use of variants of one chord .
simple , catchy and instantly recognisable .
steve haywood , wooburn green , uk ac / dc - back in black or bad boy boogie .
angus is just a guitar god .
his on-stage antics are a riot .
how he can keep his playing so great while jumping all over the shop beggers belief .
hugh , tipton , uk just thinking about " bad " by u2 .
the entire song is a riff .
constant , timeless .
yet not mentioned .
killerwatt output seems to rule -lrb- sadly -rrb- . pat , " rifles " by black rebel motorcycle club , it sounds really puny on the recording , but when played live it turns into something amazing .
some of the choices in this list are pretty weird , but its nice to see qotsa in there .
dan , leeds is it just me or do people not appreciate the difference between a riff and a solo .
definition riff - a melodic phrase repeated throughout a song .
freebird is a brilliant piece of guitar playing , however it does not have a riff .
for what it 's worth my vote would be for paranoid by black sabbath .
dave edwards , yorkshire i think ' hot for teacher ' by van halen should be on the list somewhere , just because the style is groundbreaking .. and it sounds awesome .
james hingston , springfield america hey !
" you really got me " started the whole thing !
dave davies is such a neglected talent in the axe-business ...
-lrb- even though the classic riff originally were written on - piano ... -rrb-
jan baeckman , orsa , sweden the greatest guitar riffs of all time are missing of that list .
they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !
michael idoyaga , new orleans , la , usa why is n't ca n't stop there or even under the bridge by the red hot chilis ?
they both have amazing riffs , john fruscianti -lrb- rhcp guitarist -rrb- is a genius , especially in under the bridge. mike dean , london , uk there are so many good ones but " the last time " by jagger / richards is outstanding .
neat , easy , powerful lick .
an inspired piece of riff writing !
chris hunter , bedford , uk sweet child of mine deserves to be number 1 .
my personal favorite would be metallica 's master of puppets , it made to number 7 .
another good one would be iron man by black sabbath , awesome riff !
rami el-akabawi , cairo , egypt where 's " rebel rebel " by david bowie ?
an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .
but , from the list , how can anyone go past " satisfaction " by the stones ?
truly awe-inspiring .
timothy clifford , ex-pat a great riff lets the rest of the song fade into memory while leaving the hook dangling in mind forever .
as the list is missing both dire straits ' " money for nothin " ' and the cult 's " love removal machine " i personally ca n't take it too seriously .
to omit one is folly , but to leave out both is blasphemy !
robert bickers , arlington , texas , usa how total guitar could list the top 20 riffs of all time and not include any andrew ridgley has to be a crime .
i mean , club tropicana , need i say more ... ! daz , texas usa the fact that metallica is the only band that has two songs in the top 10 really says something about this incredibly influential band .
vasco burgos , chile - lives in us joshua , the " idiots " who voted for ' smells like teen spirit ' above ' comfortably numb ' are probably the kind of idiots who know the difference between a guitar riff and a guitar solo .
both are great songs .
but only one of them contains a riff .
iggy , glasgow agree about the rolling stones , adding ' the last time ' ' jumping jack flash ' to the others mentioned peter , london uk ' are you gonna go my way ' by lenny kravitz and ' london calling ' by the clash - two songs perfectly matched with their simple riffs .
in my opinion simplicity is the key .
also - why no pink floyd ? !
is it only me that thinks ' money ' has there the world 's greatest riff ?
it 's not even in the top 20 !
jim doyle , bristol , uk sultans of swing by dire straits has the best riff i can think of .
tom , london , uk nothing by queen , stones or stairway to heaven .
go back to school !
rh , hong kong nothing by the who in the list ?
how about substitute for starters - fantastic use of variants of one chord .
simple , catchy and instantly recognisable .
steve haywood , wooburn green , uk ac / dc - back in black or bad boy boogie .
angus is just a guitar god .
his on-stage antics are a riot .
how he can keep his playing so great while jumping all over the shop beggers belief .
hugh , tipton , uk just thinking about " bad " by u2 .
the entire song is a riff .
constant , timeless .
yet not mentioned .
killerwatt output seems to rule -lrb- sadly -rrb- . pat , " rifles " by black rebel motorcycle club , it sounds really puny on the recording , but when played live it turns into something amazing .
some of the choices in this list are pretty weird , but its nice to see qotsa in there .
dan , leeds is it just me or do people not appreciate the difference between a riff and a solo .
definition riff - a melodic phrase repeated throughout a song .
freebird is a brilliant piece of guitar playing , however it does not have a riff .
for what it 's worth my vote would be for paranoid by black sabbath .
dave edwards , yorkshire i think ' hot for teacher ' by van halen should be on the list somewhere , just because the style is groundbreaking .. and it sounds awesome .
james hingston , springfield america hey !
" you really got me " started the whole thing !
dave davies is such a neglected talent in the axe-business ...
-lrb- even though the classic riff originally were written on - piano ... -rrb-
jan baeckman , orsa , sweden the greatest guitar riffs of all time are missing of that list .
they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

what makes a great riff ?
bbc news online users sent us their views .
my favourites are plug in baby by muse and requisition by clandestine . both fast moving , energy raising , sweat inducing , heart thumping guitar riffs !
woody , bracknell my favourite riff as got to be by pearl jam .
namely , rearviewmirror , a classic piece of guitar playing by one of the best bands of all time .
although not released , this album track stands out for its brilliant melody and searing lyrics .
if you have n't heard it and want to lose yourself in a hard rock classic , then look no further .
mike traylen , guildford , uk whole lotta love does it for me - extrememly simple , catchy and impossible to ever forget .
it 's a shame that it 's used as the theme tune for a programme that often showcases the worst in manufactured pop !
jon , uk keith richards ' guitar in satisfaction franco nero , middelburg holland frank zappa - watermelon in easterhay .
how can any serious commpendium of classic guitar work not included one of the greatest virtuoso 's of all time .
damien byrne , ireland whilst i appreciate that dire straits are regarded as naff by most rock fans , i would still argue that the main riff from money for nothing -lrb- from the 1985 brothers in arms album -rrb- deserves an entry .
max wurr , stanmore , uk the byrds : 8 miles high .
the start of real rock and psychodelica , mcguinn 's 12 string guitar inspred by george harrison , the byrds were the band that never quite made it although their music still lives on. howard , seoul s. korea plug in baby by muse. its the way it comes out of the intro. excellent stuff .
dan phillips , sheffield , england bombtrack-rage against the machine ! !
there are three parts to this song and all of them are excellent powerful riffs .
its the reason why i picked a guitar in the first place ! !
simon , birmingham lionel ritchie 's ' running with the night ' - the guitar solo at the end of this track is absolutely stunning findlay houliston , glasgow , uk paradise city - guns n ' roses juan , southsea -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction by the rolling stones without a doubt !
apart from being supreme to the others mentioned , it must surely be one of the most recognizable riffs ever .
when richards decided to run his guitar through a gibson fuzz box to create the distortion effect the result was a masterpiece !
kevin , essex i would vote for the human league 's " lebanon " track .
it was a great riff and a departure from their usual electronic sound .
vincent de mello , london " frame by frame " by king crimson because of the insane difficulty .
greg smith , lawrenceville , usa a great riff is - simple and straightforward to play - instantly appealing - one that gets people off their seat in the concert hall .
all right now is my favourite of those in the list , ticks all the boxes !
arthur , colchester , uk a good riff should be made from a short segment of notes or chords , repeated enough to create a great hook but not overplayed so as to be repetative and annoying .
rj , exeter england down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland new zealand down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland , new zealand status quo " whatever you want . "
is great because it gives a feeling of freedom and the open road and it just keeps on going .
ian , wroclaw , poland ex uk how can smells like teen spirit - which does n't even have a riff ! - make number 2 and nothing by the rolling stones get into the list ?
has nobody heard honky tonk women or brown sugar ?
criminal .
frank , cambridge , uk i think voodoo chili by jimi hendrix is the best riff of all time .
not only the music , but the presentation , especially at woodstock , was incredible .
how can you beat a song where the artist plays it with his teeth ?
ben , fairfield , ct , usa i think r.e.m. 's " chronic town -lrb- box cars -rrb- " has the best guitar riffs ever !
clifford speck , trincomalee , sri lanka one riff stands above all others : " satisfaction " by the stones .
after 40 years it still has the power to move one .
mike williams , corpus christi , texas smells like teen spirit at number 2 ?
it 's a joke to pretend they can compare to what the 70s gave us .
and have none of these idiots heard of comfortably numb ?
jeez ...
joshua , kenilworth , england more people ask me to teach them the riff to sweet child o ' mine than any other song , which is impressive when you consider slash -lrb- gnr guitarist -rrb- was only joking around when he first composed it .
although i think riffs can be overplayed in terms of importance , and run the risk of creating novelty music with something to latch onto , it follows on from thematic use in historical music throughout the ages so it 's good to see its survival in modern , popular music .
andy , nottm . , uk there is no doubt that the top 20 here is really special .
i was surprised , however , not to find freebird - lynyrd skynyrd in the list .. the longer version is just awesome .
and its popular too .
cheers .
manish mohan , madras , india superb list , and this is one top 20 that should indeed be based on popularity , not on critics ' sentiments .
hon 'ble mention goes to teenage kicks by the undertones .
miranda , toronto , canada when it comes to great riffs that grab you by the short and curlies then there is no better than toccatta by the legendary sky .
this obviously influenced many apprentice ' axemen ' as plug in baby by muse is a note for note copy .
paul armatage , london , uk what about the searing guitar work of joe walsh in hotel california or that of mark knopfler in sultans of swing - would these not qualify as good riffs ?
a few more that come to mind are those that happened in the doors ' light my fire , led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and badge by cream .
i guess i am old fashoned !
s. lahiri , gaithersburg , md good range in the list , and nice to see plug in baby as a modern classic , but where was 20th century boy by t rex ?
surely that deserves a mention ?
kate , london well , as good as sweet child o mine is , i think the most memorable riff that has lasted the test of time has got to be paranoid by black sabbath .
as soon as those two notes are hit , you instantly know what song it is , incredible .
as a huge muse fan i 'm pleased to see plug in baby in the top 20 , however , muse have done better , namely new born .
but good choices all round in my opinion .
ben , keith richards on satisfaction , honky tonk women , shattered , dancing with mr d , beast of burden , when the whip comes down , gimme shelter , jumpin jack flash , street fighting man , you ca n't always get . , sympathy for the devil , ... aw heck , keith on just about anything and everything .
kudos to pete townsend for the best two note riff of all time on my generation .
bill , gulf breeze , fl usa top 20 riffs without iron maiden ? ?
where were they ?
robert g eggleston , dronfield , derbyshire , england i 'd have like to have seen ' my mamma said ' by lenny kravitz and aggree entirly with damien byrne that ' watermellon in easter hay ' and ' i am the slime ' by god zappa and are sadly missing .
jim gardner , stockton on tees uk plug in baby is the best .
it 's amazing ..
hayley , england what no boston ?
anything from ' third stage ' make me want to get the air guitar out in the street !
simon , uk is it too recent for ' hysteria ' by muse ... or for that matter all of ' absolution ' ? ... that album is something not often achieved - well done muse , maybe next time .
but hey , for now kurt would be turning in his grave if he saw slts at no .
2 - # 1 surely !
row bell , sheffield , uk i agree with most of the list , but to choose rage against the machine 's killing in the name instead of satisfaction by the stones , under the bridge by red hot chili peppers or even flow by pearl jam is in my opinion a big mistake .
carlos kuriyama , new york , usa while i am utterly sick of it , sweet child o ' mine is worthy of topping that list .
layla should 've been a bit higher up i think , and tom morello 's rage against the machine riffery could do with a bit more coverage in the overall chart .
pity that g n ' r lost their touch , eh ...
gareth , nottingham , uk not many people outside of ireland , but dearg doom by horselips .
stompin ' good riff !
aisling tracy , bristol uk deep purple 's classic smoke on the water is memorable for many reasons but the riff of all riffs i think is burn for the pure adrenalin rush that kicks in when it starts .
magic ! !
kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !

an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .

simon , birmingham lionel ritchie 's ' running with the night ' - the guitar solo at the end of this track is absolutely stunning findlay houliston , glasgow , uk paradise city - guns n ' roses juan , southsea -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction by the rolling stones without a doubt !
apart from being supreme to the others mentioned , it must surely be one of the most recognizable riffs ever .
when richards decided to run his guitar through a gibson fuzz box to create the distortion effect the result was a masterpiece !
kevin , essex i would vote for the human league 's " lebanon " track .
it was a great riff and a departure from their usual electronic sound .
vincent de mello , london " frame by frame " by king crimson because of the insane difficulty .
greg smith , lawrenceville , usa a great riff is - simple and straightforward to play - instantly appealing - one that gets people off their seat in the concert hall .
all right now is my favourite of those in the list , ticks all the boxes !
arthur , colchester , uk a good riff should be made from a short segment of notes or chords , repeated enough to create a great hook but not overplayed so as to be repetative and annoying .
rj , exeter england down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland new zealand down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland , new zealand status quo " whatever you want . "
is great because it gives a feeling of freedom and the open road and it just keeps on going .
ian , wroclaw , poland ex uk how can smells like teen spirit - which does n't even have a riff ! - make number 2 and nothing by the rolling stones get into the list ?
has nobody heard honky tonk women or brown sugar ?
criminal .
frank , cambridge , uk i think voodoo chili by jimi hendrix is the best riff of all time .
not only the music , but the presentation , especially at woodstock , was incredible .
how can you beat a song where the artist plays it with his teeth ?
ben , fairfield , ct , usa i think r.e.m. 's " chronic town -lrb- box cars -rrb- " has the best guitar riffs ever !
clifford speck , trincomalee , sri lanka one riff stands above all others : " satisfaction " by the stones .
after 40 years it still has the power to move one .
mike williams , corpus christi , texas smells like teen spirit at number 2 ?
it 's a joke to pretend they can compare to what the 70s gave us .
and have none of these idiots heard of comfortably numb ?
jeez ...
joshua , kenilworth , england more people ask me to teach them the riff to sweet child o ' mine than any other song , which is impressive when you consider slash -lrb- gnr guitarist -rrb- was only joking around when he first composed it .
although i think riffs can be overplayed in terms of importance , and run the risk of creating novelty music with something to latch onto , it follows on from thematic use in historical music throughout the ages so it 's good to see its survival in modern , popular music .
andy , nottm . , uk there is no doubt that the top 20 here is really special .
i was surprised , however , not to find freebird - lynyrd skynyrd in the list .. the longer version is just awesome .
and its popular too .
cheers .
manish mohan , madras , india superb list , and this is one top 20 that should indeed be based on popularity , not on critics ' sentiments .
hon 'ble mention goes to teenage kicks by the undertones .
miranda , toronto , canada when it comes to great riffs that grab you by the short and curlies then there is no better than toccatta by the legendary sky .
this obviously influenced many apprentice ' axemen ' as plug in baby by muse is a note for note copy .
paul armatage , london , uk what about the searing guitar work of joe walsh in hotel california or that of mark knopfler in sultans of swing - would these not qualify as good riffs ?
a few more that come to mind are those that happened in the doors ' light my fire , led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and badge by cream .
i guess i am old fashoned !
s. lahiri , gaithersburg , md good range in the list , and nice to see plug in baby as a modern classic , but where was 20th century boy by t rex ?
surely that deserves a mention ?
kate , london well , as good as sweet child o mine is , i think the most memorable riff that has lasted the test of time has got to be paranoid by black sabbath .
as soon as those two notes are hit , you instantly know what song it is , incredible .
as a huge muse fan i 'm pleased to see plug in baby in the top 20 , however , muse have done better , namely new born .
but good choices all round in my opinion .
ben , keith richards on satisfaction , honky tonk women , shattered , dancing with mr d , beast of burden , when the whip comes down , gimme shelter , jumpin jack flash , street fighting man , you ca n't always get . , sympathy for the devil , ... aw heck , keith on just about anything and everything .
kudos to pete townsend for the best two note riff of all time on my generation .
bill , gulf breeze , fl usa top 20 riffs without iron maiden ? ?
where were they ?
robert g eggleston , dronfield , derbyshire , england i 'd have like to have seen ' my mamma said ' by lenny kravitz and aggree entirly with damien byrne that ' watermellon in easter hay ' and ' i am the slime ' by god zappa and are sadly missing .
jim gardner , stockton on tees uk plug in baby is the best .
it 's amazing ..
hayley , england what no boston ?
anything from ' third stage ' make me want to get the air guitar out in the street !
simon , uk is it too recent for ' hysteria ' by muse ... or for that matter all of ' absolution ' ? ... that album is something not often achieved - well done muse , maybe next time .
but hey , for now kurt would be turning in his grave if he saw slts at no .
2 - # 1 surely !
row bell , sheffield , uk i agree with most of the list , but to choose rage against the machine 's killing in the name instead of satisfaction by the stones , under the bridge by red hot chili peppers or even flow by pearl jam is in my opinion a big mistake .
carlos kuriyama , new york , usa while i am utterly sick of it , sweet child o ' mine is worthy of topping that list .
layla should 've been a bit higher up i think , and tom morello 's rage against the machine riffery could do with a bit more coverage in the overall chart .
pity that g n ' r lost their touch , eh ...
gareth , nottingham , uk not many people outside of ireland , but dearg doom by horselips .
stompin ' good riff !
aisling tracy , bristol uk deep purple 's classic smoke on the water is memorable for many reasons but the riff of all riffs i think is burn for the pure adrenalin rush that kicks in when it starts .
magic ! !
kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !
michael idoyaga , new orleans , la , usa why is n't ca n't stop there or even under the bridge by the red hot chilis ?
they both have amazing riffs , john fruscianti -lrb- rhcp guitarist -rrb- is a genius , especially in under the bridge. mike dean , london , uk there are so many good ones but " the last time " by jagger / richards is outstanding .
neat , easy , powerful lick .
an inspired piece of riff writing !
chris hunter , bedford , uk sweet child of mine deserves to be number 1 .
my personal favorite would be metallica 's master of puppets , it made to number 7 .
another good one would be iron man by black sabbath , awesome riff !
rami el-akabawi , cairo , egypt where 's " rebel rebel " by david bowie ?
an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .
but , from the list , how can anyone go past " satisfaction " by the stones ?
truly awe-inspiring .
timothy clifford , ex-pat a great riff lets the rest of the song fade into memory while leaving the hook dangling in mind forever .
as the list is missing both dire straits ' " money for nothin " ' and the cult 's " love removal machine " i personally ca n't take it too seriously .
to omit one is folly , but to leave out both is blasphemy !
robert bickers , arlington , texas , usa how total guitar could list the top 20 riffs of all time and not include any andrew ridgley has to be a crime .
i mean , club tropicana , need i say more ... ! daz , texas usa the fact that metallica is the only band that has two songs in the top 10 really says something about this incredibly influential band .
vasco burgos , chile - lives in us joshua , the " idiots " who voted for ' smells like teen spirit ' above ' comfortably numb ' are probably the kind of idiots who know the difference between a guitar riff and a guitar solo .
both are great songs .
but only one of them contains a riff .
iggy , glasgow agree about the rolling stones , adding ' the last time ' ' jumping jack flash ' to the others mentioned peter , london uk ' are you gonna go my way ' by lenny kravitz and ' london calling ' by the clash - two songs perfectly matched with their simple riffs .
in my opinion simplicity is the key .
also - why no pink floyd ? !
is it only me that thinks ' money ' has there the world 's greatest riff ?
it 's not even in the top 20 !
jim doyle , bristol , uk sultans of swing by dire straits has the best riff i can think of .
tom , london , uk nothing by queen , stones or stairway to heaven .
go back to school !
rh , hong kong nothing by the who in the list ?
how about substitute for starters - fantastic use of variants of one chord .
simple , catchy and instantly recognisable .
steve haywood , wooburn green , uk ac / dc - back in black or bad boy boogie .
angus is just a guitar god .
his on-stage antics are a riot .
how he can keep his playing so great while jumping all over the shop beggers belief .
hugh , tipton , uk just thinking about " bad " by u2 .
the entire song is a riff .
constant , timeless .
yet not mentioned .
killerwatt output seems to rule -lrb- sadly -rrb- . pat , " rifles " by black rebel motorcycle club , it sounds really puny on the recording , but when played live it turns into something amazing .
some of the choices in this list are pretty weird , but its nice to see qotsa in there .
dan , leeds is it just me or do people not appreciate the difference between a riff and a solo .
definition riff - a melodic phrase repeated throughout a song .
freebird is a brilliant piece of guitar playing , however it does not have a riff .
for what it 's worth my vote would be for paranoid by black sabbath .
dave edwards , yorkshire i think ' hot for teacher ' by van halen should be on the list somewhere , just because the style is groundbreaking .. and it sounds awesome .
james hingston , springfield america hey !
" you really got me " started the whole thing !
dave davies is such a neglected talent in the axe-business ...
-lrb- even though the classic riff originally were written on - piano ... -rrb-
jan baeckman , orsa , sweden the greatest guitar riffs of all time are missing of that list .
they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

what makes a great riff ?
bbc news online users sent us their views .
my favourites are plug in baby by muse and requisition by clandestine . both fast moving , energy raising , sweat inducing , heart thumping guitar riffs !
woody , bracknell my favourite riff as got to be by pearl jam .
namely , rearviewmirror , a classic piece of guitar playing by one of the best bands of all time .
although not released , this album track stands out for its brilliant melody and searing lyrics .
if you have n't heard it and want to lose yourself in a hard rock classic , then look no further .
mike traylen , guildford , uk whole lotta love does it for me - extrememly simple , catchy and impossible to ever forget .
it 's a shame that it 's used as the theme tune for a programme that often showcases the worst in manufactured pop !
jon , uk keith richards ' guitar in satisfaction franco nero , middelburg holland frank zappa - watermelon in easterhay .
how can any serious commpendium of classic guitar work not included one of the greatest virtuoso 's of all time .
damien byrne , ireland whilst i appreciate that dire straits are regarded as naff by most rock fans , i would still argue that the main riff from money for nothing -lrb- from the 1985 brothers in arms album -rrb- deserves an entry .
max wurr , stanmore , uk the byrds : 8 miles high .
the start of real rock and psychodelica , mcguinn 's 12 string guitar inspred by george harrison , the byrds were the band that never quite made it although their music still lives on. howard , seoul s. korea plug in baby by muse. its the way it comes out of the intro. excellent stuff .
dan phillips , sheffield , england bombtrack-rage against the machine ! !
there are three parts to this song and all of them are excellent powerful riffs .
its the reason why i picked a guitar in the first place ! !
simon , birmingham lionel ritchie 's ' running with the night ' - the guitar solo at the end of this track is absolutely stunning findlay houliston , glasgow , uk paradise city - guns n ' roses juan , southsea -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction by the rolling stones without a doubt !
apart from being supreme to the others mentioned , it must surely be one of the most recognizable riffs ever .
when richards decided to run his guitar through a gibson fuzz box to create the distortion effect the result was a masterpiece !
kevin , essex i would vote for the human league 's " lebanon " track .
it was a great riff and a departure from their usual electronic sound .
vincent de mello , london " frame by frame " by king crimson because of the insane difficulty .
greg smith , lawrenceville , usa a great riff is - simple and straightforward to play - instantly appealing - one that gets people off their seat in the concert hall .
all right now is my favourite of those in the list , ticks all the boxes !
arthur , colchester , uk a good riff should be made from a short segment of notes or chords , repeated enough to create a great hook but not overplayed so as to be repetative and annoying .
rj , exeter england down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland new zealand down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland , new zealand status quo " whatever you want . "
is great because it gives a feeling of freedom and the open road and it just keeps on going .
ian , wroclaw , poland ex uk how can smells like teen spirit - which does n't even have a riff ! - make number 2 and nothing by the rolling stones get into the list ?
has nobody heard honky tonk women or brown sugar ?
criminal .
frank , cambridge , uk i think voodoo chili by jimi hendrix is the best riff of all time .
not only the music , but the presentation , especially at woodstock , was incredible .
how can you beat a song where the artist plays it with his teeth ?
ben , fairfield , ct , usa i think r.e.m. 's " chronic town -lrb- box cars -rrb- " has the best guitar riffs ever !
clifford speck , trincomalee , sri lanka one riff stands above all others : " satisfaction " by the stones .
after 40 years it still has the power to move one .
mike williams , corpus christi , texas smells like teen spirit at number 2 ?
it 's a joke to pretend they can compare to what the 70s gave us .
and have none of these idiots heard of comfortably numb ?
jeez ...
joshua , kenilworth , england more people ask me to teach them the riff to sweet child o ' mine than any other song , which is impressive when you consider slash -lrb- gnr guitarist -rrb- was only joking around when he first composed it .
although i think riffs can be overplayed in terms of importance , and run the risk of creating novelty music with something to latch onto , it follows on from thematic use in historical music throughout the ages so it 's good to see its survival in modern , popular music .
andy , nottm . , uk there is no doubt that the top 20 here is really special .
i was surprised , however , not to find freebird - lynyrd skynyrd in the list .. the longer version is just awesome .
and its popular too .
cheers .
manish mohan , madras , india superb list , and this is one top 20 that should indeed be based on popularity , not on critics ' sentiments .
hon 'ble mention goes to teenage kicks by the undertones .
miranda , toronto , canada when it comes to great riffs that grab you by the short and curlies then there is no better than toccatta by the legendary sky .
this obviously influenced many apprentice ' axemen ' as plug in baby by muse is a note for note copy .
paul armatage , london , uk what about the searing guitar work of joe walsh in hotel california or that of mark knopfler in sultans of swing - would these not qualify as good riffs ?
a few more that come to mind are those that happened in the doors ' light my fire , led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and badge by cream .
i guess i am old fashoned !
s. lahiri , gaithersburg , md good range in the list , and nice to see plug in baby as a modern classic , but where was 20th century boy by t rex ?
surely that deserves a mention ?
kate , london well , as good as sweet child o mine is , i think the most memorable riff that has lasted the test of time has got to be paranoid by black sabbath .
as soon as those two notes are hit , you instantly know what song it is , incredible .
as a huge muse fan i 'm pleased to see plug in baby in the top 20 , however , muse have done better , namely new born .
but good choices all round in my opinion .
ben , keith richards on satisfaction , honky tonk women , shattered , dancing with mr d , beast of burden , when the whip comes down , gimme shelter , jumpin jack flash , street fighting man , you ca n't always get . , sympathy for the devil , ... aw heck , keith on just about anything and everything .
kudos to pete townsend for the best two note riff of all time on my generation .
bill , gulf breeze , fl usa top 20 riffs without iron maiden ? ?
where were they ?
robert g eggleston , dronfield , derbyshire , england i 'd have like to have seen ' my mamma said ' by lenny kravitz and aggree entirly with damien byrne that ' watermellon in easter hay ' and ' i am the slime ' by god zappa and are sadly missing .
jim gardner , stockton on tees uk plug in baby is the best .
it 's amazing ..
hayley , england what no boston ?
anything from ' third stage ' make me want to get the air guitar out in the street !
simon , uk is it too recent for ' hysteria ' by muse ... or for that matter all of ' absolution ' ? ... that album is something not often achieved - well done muse , maybe next time .
but hey , for now kurt would be turning in his grave if he saw slts at no .
2 - # 1 surely !
row bell , sheffield , uk i agree with most of the list , but to choose rage against the machine 's killing in the name instead of satisfaction by the stones , under the bridge by red hot chili peppers or even flow by pearl jam is in my opinion a big mistake .
carlos kuriyama , new york , usa while i am utterly sick of it , sweet child o ' mine is worthy of topping that list .
layla should 've been a bit higher up i think , and tom morello 's rage against the machine riffery could do with a bit more coverage in the overall chart .
pity that g n ' r lost their touch , eh ...
gareth , nottingham , uk not many people outside of ireland , but dearg doom by horselips .
stompin ' good riff !
aisling tracy , bristol uk deep purple 's classic smoke on the water is memorable for many reasons but the riff of all riffs i think is burn for the pure adrenalin rush that kicks in when it starts .
magic ! !
kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !
michael idoyaga , new orleans , la , usa why is n't ca n't stop there or even under the bridge by the red hot chilis ?
they both have amazing riffs , john fruscianti -lrb- rhcp guitarist -rrb- is a genius , especially in under the bridge. mike dean , london , uk there are so many good ones but " the last time " by jagger / richards is outstanding .
neat , easy , powerful lick .
an inspired piece of riff writing !
chris hunter , bedford , uk sweet child of mine deserves to be number 1 .
my personal favorite would be metallica 's master of puppets , it made to number 7 .
another good one would be iron man by black sabbath , awesome riff !
rami el-akabawi , cairo , egypt where 's " rebel rebel " by david bowie ?
an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .
but , from the list , how can anyone go past " satisfaction " by the stones ?
truly awe-inspiring .
timothy clifford , ex-pat a great riff lets the rest of the song fade into memory while leaving the hook dangling in mind forever .
as the list is missing both dire straits ' " money for nothin " ' and the cult 's " love removal machine " i personally ca n't take it too seriously .
to omit one is folly , but to leave out both is blasphemy !
robert bickers , arlington , texas , usa how total guitar could list the top 20 riffs of all time and not include any andrew ridgley has to be a crime .
i mean , club tropicana , need i say more ... ! daz , texas usa the fact that metallica is the only band that has two songs in the top 10 really says something about this incredibly influential band .
vasco burgos , chile - lives in us joshua , the " idiots " who voted for ' smells like teen spirit ' above ' comfortably numb ' are probably the kind of idiots who know the difference between a guitar riff and a guitar solo .
both are great songs .
but only one of them contains a riff .
iggy , glasgow agree about the rolling stones , adding ' the last time ' ' jumping jack flash ' to the others mentioned peter , london uk ' are you gonna go my way ' by lenny kravitz and ' london calling ' by the clash - two songs perfectly matched with their simple riffs .
in my opinion simplicity is the key .
also - why no pink floyd ? !
is it only me that thinks ' money ' has there the world 's greatest riff ?
it 's not even in the top 20 !
jim doyle , bristol , uk sultans of swing by dire straits has the best riff i can think of .
tom , london , uk nothing by queen , stones or stairway to heaven .
go back to school !
rh , hong kong nothing by the who in the list ?
how about substitute for starters - fantastic use of variants of one chord .
simple , catchy and instantly recognisable .
steve haywood , wooburn green , uk ac / dc - back in black or bad boy boogie .
angus is just a guitar god .
his on-stage antics are a riot .
how he can keep his playing so great while jumping all over the shop beggers belief .
hugh , tipton , uk just thinking about " bad " by u2 .
the entire song is a riff .
constant , timeless .
yet not mentioned .
killerwatt output seems to rule -lrb- sadly -rrb- . pat , " rifles " by black rebel motorcycle club , it sounds really puny on the recording , but when played live it turns into something amazing .
some of the choices in this list are pretty weird , but its nice to see qotsa in there .
dan , leeds is it just me or do people not appreciate the difference between a riff and a solo .
definition riff - a melodic phrase repeated throughout a song .
freebird is a brilliant piece of guitar playing , however it does not have a riff .
for what it 's worth my vote would be for paranoid by black sabbath .
dave edwards , yorkshire i think ' hot for teacher ' by van halen should be on the list somewhere , just because the style is groundbreaking .. and it sounds awesome .
james hingston , springfield america hey !
" you really got me " started the whole thing !
dave davies is such a neglected talent in the axe-business ...
-lrb- even though the classic riff originally were written on - piano ... -rrb-
jan baeckman , orsa , sweden the greatest guitar riffs of all time are missing of that list .
they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

robert g eggleston , dronfield , derbyshire , england i 'd have like to have seen ' my mamma said ' by lenny kravitz and aggree entirly with damien byrne that ' watermellon in easter hay ' and ' i am the slime ' by god zappa and are sadly missing .
jim gardner , stockton on tees uk plug in baby is the best .
it 's amazing ..
hayley , england what no boston ?
anything from ' third stage ' make me want to get the air guitar out in the street !
simon , uk is it too recent for ' hysteria ' by muse ... or for that matter all of ' absolution ' ? ... that album is something not often achieved - well done muse , maybe next time .
but hey , for now kurt would be turning in his grave if he saw slts at no .
2 - # 1 surely !
row bell , sheffield , uk i agree with most of the list , but to choose rage against the machine 's killing in the name instead of satisfaction by the stones , under the bridge by red hot chili peppers or even flow by pearl jam is in my opinion a big mistake .
carlos kuriyama , new york , usa while i am utterly sick of it , sweet child o ' mine is worthy of topping that list .
layla should 've been a bit higher up i think , and tom morello 's rage against the machine riffery could do with a bit more coverage in the overall chart .
pity that g n ' r lost their touch , eh ...
gareth , nottingham , uk not many people outside of ireland , but dearg doom by horselips .
stompin ' good riff !
aisling tracy , bristol uk deep purple 's classic smoke on the water is memorable for many reasons but the riff of all riffs i think is burn for the pure adrenalin rush that kicks in when it starts .
magic ! !
kevin , cardiff , wales i ca n't believe iron maiden have n't been mentioned yet , of whom i vote for ' 2 minutes to midnight ' - it has such an unbelievable , unforgettable charge up .
ben brown , chester-le-street , uk eric clapton 's ' layla ' , beyond a shadow of a doubt - & i 'll see / hear him play it next saturday at the albert hall ! !
carolyn middleton , aberdeen , scotland the entirety of the album cypher from ... and oceans is my favourite guitar riff . : -rrb- alex s , edison , nj , usa detroit rock city by kiss is memorable , as is their rock n roll all night , but the best riff ever ... ?
like asking to choose which child you would like to save from a fire ...
impossible ! ! !
bigdek , birmingham , englands i guess " satisfaction " is the most famous riff ever , but i prefer " honky tonk women " .
it could n't be simpler ; just tune your telecaster to open g and play with one hand !
michael idoyaga , new orleans , la , usa why is n't ca n't stop there or even under the bridge by the red hot chilis ?
they both have amazing riffs , john fruscianti -lrb- rhcp guitarist -rrb- is a genius , especially in under the bridge. mike dean , london , uk there are so many good ones but " the last time " by jagger / richards is outstanding .
neat , easy , powerful lick .
an inspired piece of riff writing !
chris hunter , bedford , uk sweet child of mine deserves to be number 1 .
my personal favorite would be metallica 's master of puppets , it made to number 7 .
another good one would be iron man by black sabbath , awesome riff !
rami el-akabawi , cairo , egypt where 's " rebel rebel " by david bowie ?
an absolute classic riff .
ben cottam , coventry , england i cant believe no-one mentioned cream - sunshine of your love !
an amazing riff that many people would recognise , but far fewer would be able to name the song .
mike parker , sheffield , uk british metal legends , iron maiden , with " fear of the dark " , or the sweet 's " alexander graham bell " both really do it for me .
but , from the list , how can anyone go past " satisfaction " by the stones ?
truly awe-inspiring .
timothy clifford , ex-pat a great riff lets the rest of the song fade into memory while leaving the hook dangling in mind forever .
as the list is missing both dire straits ' " money for nothin " ' and the cult 's " love removal machine " i personally ca n't take it too seriously .
to omit one is folly , but to leave out both is blasphemy !
robert bickers , arlington , texas , usa how total guitar could list the top 20 riffs of all time and not include any andrew ridgley has to be a crime .
i mean , club tropicana , need i say more ... ! daz , texas usa the fact that metallica is the only band that has two songs in the top 10 really says something about this incredibly influential band .
vasco burgos , chile - lives in us joshua , the " idiots " who voted for ' smells like teen spirit ' above ' comfortably numb ' are probably the kind of idiots who know the difference between a guitar riff and a guitar solo .
both are great songs .
but only one of them contains a riff .
iggy , glasgow agree about the rolling stones , adding ' the last time ' ' jumping jack flash ' to the others mentioned peter , london uk ' are you gonna go my way ' by lenny kravitz and ' london calling ' by the clash - two songs perfectly matched with their simple riffs .
in my opinion simplicity is the key .
also - why no pink floyd ? !
is it only me that thinks ' money ' has there the world 's greatest riff ?
it 's not even in the top 20 !
jim doyle , bristol , uk sultans of swing by dire straits has the best riff i can think of .
tom , london , uk nothing by queen , stones or stairway to heaven .
go back to school !
rh , hong kong nothing by the who in the list ?
how about substitute for starters - fantastic use of variants of one chord .
simple , catchy and instantly recognisable .
steve haywood , wooburn green , uk ac / dc - back in black or bad boy boogie .
angus is just a guitar god .
his on-stage antics are a riot .
how he can keep his playing so great while jumping all over the shop beggers belief .
hugh , tipton , uk just thinking about " bad " by u2 .
the entire song is a riff .
constant , timeless .
yet not mentioned .
killerwatt output seems to rule -lrb- sadly -rrb- . pat , " rifles " by black rebel motorcycle club , it sounds really puny on the recording , but when played live it turns into something amazing .
some of the choices in this list are pretty weird , but its nice to see qotsa in there .
dan , leeds is it just me or do people not appreciate the difference between a riff and a solo .
definition riff - a melodic phrase repeated throughout a song .
freebird is a brilliant piece of guitar playing , however it does not have a riff .
for what it 's worth my vote would be for paranoid by black sabbath .
dave edwards , yorkshire i think ' hot for teacher ' by van halen should be on the list somewhere , just because the style is groundbreaking .. and it sounds awesome .
james hingston , springfield america hey !
" you really got me " started the whole thing !
dave davies is such a neglected talent in the axe-business ...
-lrb- even though the classic riff originally were written on - piano ... -rrb-
jan baeckman , orsa , sweden the greatest guitar riffs of all time are missing of that list .
they are the riff by joe walsh in life in the fast lane by the eagles , and the riff in kashmir by led zepplin. but maybe it is hotel california by the eagles and the greatest end to a song ever. what a riff at the end .
alex skander , leeds , uk hard to argue with guns 'n'roses at number one for their riff , but for me gary moore in still got the blues has to up there too .
steve wroblewski , brit .
expat - malaysia some fair points made here about ' smells like teen spirit ' .
but as any fule kno - and cobain admitted - it 's actually a rip-off of the riff from boston 's ' more than a feeling ' pete , london wow !
so many great riffs to choose from .
two faves that were n't on the list would be queen 's " we are the champions " and the eagles ' " hotel california " .
to me , a great riff sends a chill through you when you hear it -lrb- and you want to hear it again and again ! -rrb- .

bbc news online users sent us their views .
my favourites are plug in baby by muse and requisition by clandestine . both fast moving , energy raising , sweat inducing , heart thumping guitar riffs !
woody , bracknell my favourite riff as got to be by pearl jam .
namely , rearviewmirror , a classic piece of guitar playing by one of the best bands of all time .
although not released , this album track stands out for its brilliant melody and searing lyrics .
if you have n't heard it and want to lose yourself in a hard rock classic , then look no further .
mike traylen , guildford , uk whole lotta love does it for me - extrememly simple , catchy and impossible to ever forget .
it 's a shame that it 's used as the theme tune for a programme that often showcases the worst in manufactured pop !
jon , uk keith richards ' guitar in satisfaction franco nero , middelburg holland frank zappa - watermelon in easterhay .
how can any serious commpendium of classic guitar work not included one of the greatest virtuoso 's of all time .
damien byrne , ireland whilst i appreciate that dire straits are regarded as naff by most rock fans , i would still argue that the main riff from money for nothing -lrb- from the 1985 brothers in arms album -rrb- deserves an entry .
max wurr , stanmore , uk the byrds : 8 miles high .
the start of real rock and psychodelica , mcguinn 's 12 string guitar inspred by george harrison , the byrds were the band that never quite made it although their music still lives on. howard , seoul s. korea plug in baby by muse. its the way it comes out of the intro. excellent stuff .
dan phillips , sheffield , england bombtrack-rage against the machine ! !
there are three parts to this song and all of them are excellent powerful riffs .
its the reason why i picked a guitar in the first place ! !
simon , birmingham lionel ritchie 's ' running with the night ' - the guitar solo at the end of this track is absolutely stunning findlay houliston , glasgow , uk paradise city - guns n ' roses juan , southsea -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction by the rolling stones without a doubt !
apart from being supreme to the others mentioned , it must surely be one of the most recognizable riffs ever .
when richards decided to run his guitar through a gibson fuzz box to create the distortion effect the result was a masterpiece !
kevin , essex i would vote for the human league 's " lebanon " track .
it was a great riff and a departure from their usual electronic sound .
vincent de mello , london " frame by frame " by king crimson because of the insane difficulty .
greg smith , lawrenceville , usa a great riff is - simple and straightforward to play - instantly appealing - one that gets people off their seat in the concert hall .
all right now is my favourite of those in the list , ticks all the boxes !
arthur , colchester , uk a good riff should be made from a short segment of notes or chords , repeated enough to create a great hook but not overplayed so as to be repetative and annoying .
rj , exeter england down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland new zealand down here , we have a different standard for great guitar riffs , set by the legendary garage band " last tango " and their incendiary tribute to captain oates , " country life " , or the more thoughtful but unforgettable " before i read rorty " .
a great riff must have a philosophy of self .
peter weekes , auckland , new zealand status quo " whatever you want . "
is great because it gives a feeling of freedom and the open road and it just keeps on going .
ian , wroclaw , poland ex uk how can smells like teen spirit - which does n't even have a riff ! - make number 2 and nothing by the rolling stones get into the list ?
has nobody heard honky tonk women or brown sugar ?
criminal .
frank , cambridge , uk i think voodoo chili by jimi hendrix is the best riff of all time .
not only the music , but the presentation , especially at woodstock , was incredible .
how can you beat a song where the artist plays it with his teeth ?
ben , fairfield , ct , usa i think r.e.m. 's " chronic town -lrb- box cars -rrb- " has the best guitar riffs ever !
clifford speck , trincomalee , sri lanka one riff stands above all others : " satisfaction " by the stones .
after 40 years it still has the power to move one .
mike williams , corpus christi , texas smells like teen spirit at number 2 ?
it 's a joke to pretend they can compare to what the 70s gave us .
and have none of these idiots heard of comfortably numb ?
jeez ...
joshua , kenilworth , england more people ask me to teach them the riff to sweet child o ' mine than any other song , which is impressive when you consider slash -lrb- gnr guitarist -rrb- was only joking around when he first composed it .
although i think riffs can be overplayed in terms of importance , and run the risk of creating novelty music with something to latch onto , it follows on from thematic use in historical music throughout the ages so it 's good to see its survival in modern , popular music .
andy , nottm . , uk there is no doubt that the top 20 here is really special .
i was surprised , however , not to find freebird - lynyrd skynyrd in the list .. the longer version is just awesome .
and its popular too .
cheers .
manish mohan , madras , india superb list , and this is one top 20 that should indeed be based on popularity , not on critics ' sentiments .
hon 'ble mention goes to teenage kicks by the undertones .
miranda , toronto , canada when it comes to great riffs that grab you by the short and curlies then there is no better than toccatta by the legendary sky .
this obviously influenced many apprentice ' axemen ' as plug in baby by muse is a note for note copy .
paul armatage , london , uk what about the searing guitar work of joe walsh in hotel california or that of mark knopfler in sultans of swing - would these not qualify as good riffs ?
a few more that come to mind are those that happened in the doors ' light my fire , led zeppelin 's stairway to heaven and badge by cream .
i guess i am old fashoned !
s. lahiri , gaithersburg , md good range in the list , and nice to see plug in baby as a modern classic , but where was 20th century boy by t rex ?
surely that deserves a mention ?
kate , london well , as good as sweet child o mine is , i think the most memorable riff that has lasted the test of time has got to be paranoid by black sabbath .
as soon as those two notes are hit , you instantly know what song it is , incredible .
as a huge muse fan i 'm pleased to see plug in baby in the top 20 , however , muse have done better , namely new born .
but good choices all round in my opinion .
ben , keith richards on satisfaction , honky tonk women , shattered , dancing with mr d , beast of burden , when the whip comes down , gimme shelter , jumpin jack flash , street fighting man , you ca n't always get . , sympathy for the devil , ... aw heck , keith on just about anything and everything .
kudos to pete townsend for the best two note riff of all time on my generation .

stephen byers said mr blair had a " huge appetite " to remain in the job .
but the former transport secretary told gmtv that , without a blairite manifesto of real change , voters might think he would not be there to see it through .
last week downing street dismissed reports speculating about how long mr blair wants to remain prime minister .
blair ' indispensable ' mr byers said : " i think the acid test will be whether or not we have a clearly blairite manifesto for labour in the run-up to the next general election . "
without one , the government risked losing people who voted labour for the first time when the party took power in 1997 , he said .
culture secretary tessa jowell also backed mr blair on the programme , saying his leadership was " indispensable " .
comments by former labour leader neil kinnock last weekend fuelled speculation about mr blair 's future .
mr byers is seen as close to the prime minister he said it would be understandable if the pm considered " hanging his boots up " after the referendum on the eu constitution .
some saw this as a signal of a new deal to allow chancellor gordon brown to succeed mr blair as prime minister .
but health secretary john reid dismissed reports as " misleading and ill-informed speculation in certain sections of the press " .
on sunday mr byers said a third term would give mr blair 's government the chance to change the political landscape .
he said since 1945 , only clement attlee and margaret thatcher 's governments had achieved that .

stephen byers said mr blair had a " huge appetite " to remain in the job .
