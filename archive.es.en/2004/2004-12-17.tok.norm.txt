the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .
the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .
it had all seemed so much more positive late thursday , when eu leaders were busy trumpeting their historic offer to start membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister balkenende -lrb- left -rrb- and european commission president jose barroso " tonight the european union has opened its door to turkey , " said european commission chief jose barroso , who would be in charge of negotiations . backers of turkey 's eu hopes , also including germany , have long argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east .
" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .

some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .
in return , the greek cypriots would be pushed to start new talks with the turk cypriots . united states diplomats have been heavily involved behind the scenes .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .
croatia is still a ways behind its more northern neighbors and is awaiting a green light from brussels to begin accession talks . “ i ’ m confident that the eu leaders will approve the accession negotiations and set a date for the signing of the accession treaties in the first half of 2005 , ” barroso said of bulgaria and romania , which are on track to join the eu in 2007 . “ the same goes for croatia , as i assume a date for agreement can be reached on when the accession negotiations should begin , ” he added of the balkan country , provided it agrees to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal . the eu has been pressing zagreb to work together with the hague-based tribunal in the arresting of fugitive war criminals from former yugoslavia .
“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .
a certain amount of uncertainty still surrounds the country ’ s track record and its ability to push through all the necessary reforms by 2007 . the eu commission has set up a strict monitoring process to keep an eye on bucharest ’ s progress in judicial reform , border protection , environmental cleaup , fighting corruption and ending illegal state aid to industry . the european parliament also expressed concerns over romania .
“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .
the accession entry date is by no means a guarantee , officials in brussels stress , with an eye to romania , croatia and turkey . historic moment despite such remarks , the eu summit will be a historic moment for romania and bulgaria , bringing them to the threshold of one of the world ’ s biggest economies , with its promise of prosperity , security and the flowing of billions of euros in development aid to build roads , create jobs and clean up the environment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still at odds over turkey croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .
the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .
it had all seemed so much more positive late thursday , when eu leaders were busy trumpeting their historic offer to start membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister balkenende -lrb- left -rrb- and european commission president jose barroso " tonight the european union has opened its door to turkey , " said european commission chief jose barroso , who would be in charge of negotiations . backers of turkey 's eu hopes , also including germany , have long argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east .
" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .
the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .
it had all seemed so much more positive late thursday , when eu leaders were busy trumpeting their historic offer to start membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister balkenende -lrb- left -rrb- and european commission president jose barroso " tonight the european union has opened its door to turkey , " said european commission chief jose barroso , who would be in charge of negotiations . backers of turkey 's eu hopes , also including germany , have long argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east .
" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .
today , turkey is the only country that recognises the northern turkish-controlled part as a state and does not recognise the government of the greek south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , right , tried to broker a deal in march an attempt to re-unite the two communities failed in march because the southern greeks turned down a united nations brokered deal .

some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .
croatia is still a ways behind its more northern neighbors and is awaiting a green light from brussels to begin accession talks . “ i ’ m confident that the eu leaders will approve the accession negotiations and set a date for the signing of the accession treaties in the first half of 2005 , ” barroso said of bulgaria and romania , which are on track to join the eu in 2007 . “ the same goes for croatia , as i assume a date for agreement can be reached on when the accession negotiations should begin , ” he added of the balkan country , provided it agrees to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal . the eu has been pressing zagreb to work together with the hague-based tribunal in the arresting of fugitive war criminals from former yugoslavia .
“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .
a certain amount of uncertainty still surrounds the country ’ s track record and its ability to push through all the necessary reforms by 2007 . the eu commission has set up a strict monitoring process to keep an eye on bucharest ’ s progress in judicial reform , border protection , environmental cleaup , fighting corruption and ending illegal state aid to industry . the european parliament also expressed concerns over romania .
“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .
the accession entry date is by no means a guarantee , officials in brussels stress , with an eye to romania , croatia and turkey . historic moment despite such remarks , the eu summit will be a historic moment for romania and bulgaria , bringing them to the threshold of one of the world ’ s biggest economies , with its promise of prosperity , security and the flowing of billions of euros in development aid to build roads , create jobs and clean up the environment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still at odds over turkey croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .

if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2004 budget wrangling at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the eu does n't come cheap with all the talk of turkey 's bid to join the eu , it 's easy to forget there are other issues on the agenda at the summit in brussels .
the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .
croatia is still a ways behind its more northern neighbors and is awaiting a green light from brussels to begin accession talks . “ i ’ m confident that the eu leaders will approve the accession negotiations and set a date for the signing of the accession treaties in the first half of 2005 , ” barroso said of bulgaria and romania , which are on track to join the eu in 2007 . “ the same goes for croatia , as i assume a date for agreement can be reached on when the accession negotiations should begin , ” he added of the balkan country , provided it agrees to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal . the eu has been pressing zagreb to work together with the hague-based tribunal in the arresting of fugitive war criminals from former yugoslavia .
“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .
a certain amount of uncertainty still surrounds the country ’ s track record and its ability to push through all the necessary reforms by 2007 . the eu commission has set up a strict monitoring process to keep an eye on bucharest ’ s progress in judicial reform , border protection , environmental cleaup , fighting corruption and ending illegal state aid to industry . the european parliament also expressed concerns over romania .
“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .
the accession entry date is by no means a guarantee , officials in brussels stress , with an eye to romania , croatia and turkey . historic moment despite such remarks , the eu summit will be a historic moment for romania and bulgaria , bringing them to the threshold of one of the world ’ s biggest economies , with its promise of prosperity , security and the flowing of billions of euros in development aid to build roads , create jobs and clean up the environment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still at odds over turkey croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
though the bloc has left a back door open in case bulgaria takes a wrong turn in the final steps on its path toward eu membership , officials foresee an eu flag flying over sofia on jan .
1 , 2007 .
click here for more information on the politics and history of bulgaria .
as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "
corruption concerns remain " on the one hand , there is a lot of enthusiasm about joining the eu , " said george tabakov , chairman of the bulgarian economic forum .
" on the other hand there is still work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still a big problem in bulgarian society the eu ’ s remaining concerns focus on making sure bulgaria continues reforming its judiciary system and implementing , and not just talking about , changes that make all branches of government less susceptible to corruption .
us ambassador james pardew recently blasted the bulgarian government for not doing enough to prosecute high-level organized crime and corruption , such as when the bbc caught ivan slavkov , former head of bulgaria ’ s olympic committee , trying to influence the 2012 olympic bidding process through bribes .
international networking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy , center , shares a word with dutch counterpart ben bot , right , and slovenia 's dimitri rupel during a meeting of the osce at the palace of culture in sofia , last week demonstrating the country 's desire to play fairly in the international community , bulgaria served as chairman of the organization for cooperation and development in 2004 .
as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
much of the incoming money will be spent dismantling the soviet-era kozloduy nuclear plant by the end of 2006 .
eager trade partner bulgaria is also hoping to profit from increased trade with the eu now that an accession date has been set .
eu members already account for 56 percent of bulgaria ’ s total export sales worth about € 3.61 billion .
just under half of bulgaria ’ s imports , worth € 4.7 billion , came from eu members and in 2003 bulgaria experienced a real gross domestic product growth of 4.3 percent .
though living in what the eu calls a " stable market economy , " the average bulgarian 's income is less than a third of that in eu member states .
the bulgarian labor market is improving and unemployment has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in the first half of 2004 .
with 63 percent of bulgaria ’ s 7.8 million people expressing a favorable view of the european union , it ’ s only a matter of time until sofia becomes an eu capital . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria edges closer to eu membership after successfully wrapping up entry talks with the european union in luxembourg this week , bulgaria is slowly but surely approaching its goal of joining the 25-nation eu club by 2007 .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
though the bloc has left a back door open in case bulgaria takes a wrong turn in the final steps on its path toward eu membership , officials foresee an eu flag flying over sofia on jan .
1 , 2007 .
click here for more information on the politics and history of bulgaria .
as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "
corruption concerns remain " on the one hand , there is a lot of enthusiasm about joining the eu , " said george tabakov , chairman of the bulgarian economic forum .
" on the other hand there is still work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still a big problem in bulgarian society the eu ’ s remaining concerns focus on making sure bulgaria continues reforming its judiciary system and implementing , and not just talking about , changes that make all branches of government less susceptible to corruption .
us ambassador james pardew recently blasted the bulgarian government for not doing enough to prosecute high-level organized crime and corruption , such as when the bbc caught ivan slavkov , former head of bulgaria ’ s olympic committee , trying to influence the 2012 olympic bidding process through bribes .
international networking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy , center , shares a word with dutch counterpart ben bot , right , and slovenia 's dimitri rupel during a meeting of the osce at the palace of culture in sofia , last week demonstrating the country 's desire to play fairly in the international community , bulgaria served as chairman of the organization for cooperation and development in 2004 .
as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
much of the incoming money will be spent dismantling the soviet-era kozloduy nuclear plant by the end of 2006 .
eager trade partner bulgaria is also hoping to profit from increased trade with the eu now that an accession date has been set .
eu members already account for 56 percent of bulgaria ’ s total export sales worth about € 3.61 billion .
just under half of bulgaria ’ s imports , worth € 4.7 billion , came from eu members and in 2003 bulgaria experienced a real gross domestic product growth of 4.3 percent .
though living in what the eu calls a " stable market economy , " the average bulgarian 's income is less than a third of that in eu member states .
the bulgarian labor market is improving and unemployment has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in the first half of 2004 .
with 63 percent of bulgaria ’ s 7.8 million people expressing a favorable view of the european union , it ’ s only a matter of time until sofia becomes an eu capital . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria edges closer to eu membership after successfully wrapping up entry talks with the european union in luxembourg this week , bulgaria is slowly but surely approaching its goal of joining the 25-nation eu club by 2007 .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .

as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
though the bloc has left a back door open in case bulgaria takes a wrong turn in the final steps on its path toward eu membership , officials foresee an eu flag flying over sofia on jan .

as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "
corruption concerns remain " on the one hand , there is a lot of enthusiasm about joining the eu , " said george tabakov , chairman of the bulgarian economic forum .

us ambassador james pardew recently blasted the bulgarian government for not doing enough to prosecute high-level organized crime and corruption , such as when the bbc caught ivan slavkov , former head of bulgaria ’ s olympic committee , trying to influence the 2012 olympic bidding process through bribes .

as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .

it will instead make do with a verbal declaration of good will by turkey . eu leaders scramble for a compromise after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " by the stringent cyprus conditions requested by the eu , key union members sought to work out a fresh proposal on friday morning .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met to take stock of the situation . bildunterschrift : eu leaders and heads of state stand for a group photo at an eu summit in brussels later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal to save the day .

backers of turkey 's eu hopes , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east . but critics , including many members of germany 's opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . on friday , conservative german politicians reiterated those concerns .
gerd müller , parliamentary spokesman for european and foreign affairs for the cdu 's bavarian sister party , csu , said the decision to offer entry talks to turkey was taken against the will of the german people . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrambles for compromise with turkey eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2004 budget wrangling at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the eu does n't come cheap with all the talk of turkey 's bid to join the eu , it 's easy to forget there are other issues on the agenda at the summit in brussels .
the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .
croatia is still a ways behind its more northern neighbors and is awaiting a green light from brussels to begin accession talks . “ i ’ m confident that the eu leaders will approve the accession negotiations and set a date for the signing of the accession treaties in the first half of 2005 , ” barroso said of bulgaria and romania , which are on track to join the eu in 2007 . “ the same goes for croatia , as i assume a date for agreement can be reached on when the accession negotiations should begin , ” he added of the balkan country , provided it agrees to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal . the eu has been pressing zagreb to work together with the hague-based tribunal in the arresting of fugitive war criminals from former yugoslavia .
“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .
a certain amount of uncertainty still surrounds the country ’ s track record and its ability to push through all the necessary reforms by 2007 . the eu commission has set up a strict monitoring process to keep an eye on bucharest ’ s progress in judicial reform , border protection , environmental cleaup , fighting corruption and ending illegal state aid to industry . the european parliament also expressed concerns over romania .
“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .
the accession entry date is by no means a guarantee , officials in brussels stress , with an eye to romania , croatia and turkey . historic moment despite such remarks , the eu summit will be a historic moment for romania and bulgaria , bringing them to the threshold of one of the world ’ s biggest economies , with its promise of prosperity , security and the flowing of billions of euros in development aid to build roads , create jobs and clean up the environment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still at odds over turkey croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .

the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .
today , turkey is the only country that recognises the northern turkish-controlled part as a state and does not recognise the government of the greek south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , right , tried to broker a deal in march an attempt to re-unite the two communities failed in march because the southern greeks turned down a united nations brokered deal .
in may , the eu accepted all of cyprus as a member . turkey has , so far , categorically ruled out recognition of cyprus as long as there ’ s no peace treaty accepted by both communities on the island .
some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .
in return , the greek cypriots would be pushed to start new talks with the turk cypriots . united states diplomats have been heavily involved behind the scenes .
the us wants turkey integrated with the eu and has leaned heavily on the greek cypriots not to block it .
there has also been heavy pressure from britain towards that end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tentative cross-border travel many turkish cypriots are known to be unhappy about turkey ’ s heavy-handedness in the north .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
though the bloc has left a back door open in case bulgaria takes a wrong turn in the final steps on its path toward eu membership , officials foresee an eu flag flying over sofia on jan .
1 , 2007 .
click here for more information on the politics and history of bulgaria .
as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "
corruption concerns remain " on the one hand , there is a lot of enthusiasm about joining the eu , " said george tabakov , chairman of the bulgarian economic forum .
" on the other hand there is still work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still a big problem in bulgarian society the eu ’ s remaining concerns focus on making sure bulgaria continues reforming its judiciary system and implementing , and not just talking about , changes that make all branches of government less susceptible to corruption .
us ambassador james pardew recently blasted the bulgarian government for not doing enough to prosecute high-level organized crime and corruption , such as when the bbc caught ivan slavkov , former head of bulgaria ’ s olympic committee , trying to influence the 2012 olympic bidding process through bribes .
international networking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy , center , shares a word with dutch counterpart ben bot , right , and slovenia 's dimitri rupel during a meeting of the osce at the palace of culture in sofia , last week demonstrating the country 's desire to play fairly in the international community , bulgaria served as chairman of the organization for cooperation and development in 2004 .
as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
much of the incoming money will be spent dismantling the soviet-era kozloduy nuclear plant by the end of 2006 .
eager trade partner bulgaria is also hoping to profit from increased trade with the eu now that an accession date has been set .
eu members already account for 56 percent of bulgaria ’ s total export sales worth about € 3.61 billion .
just under half of bulgaria ’ s imports , worth € 4.7 billion , came from eu members and in 2003 bulgaria experienced a real gross domestic product growth of 4.3 percent .
though living in what the eu calls a " stable market economy , " the average bulgarian 's income is less than a third of that in eu member states .
the bulgarian labor market is improving and unemployment has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in the first half of 2004 .
with 63 percent of bulgaria ’ s 7.8 million people expressing a favorable view of the european union , it ’ s only a matter of time until sofia becomes an eu capital . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria edges closer to eu membership after successfully wrapping up entry talks with the european union in luxembourg this week , bulgaria is slowly but surely approaching its goal of joining the 25-nation eu club by 2007 .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
though the bloc has left a back door open in case bulgaria takes a wrong turn in the final steps on its path toward eu membership , officials foresee an eu flag flying over sofia on jan .
1 , 2007 .
click here for more information on the politics and history of bulgaria .
as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "
corruption concerns remain " on the one hand , there is a lot of enthusiasm about joining the eu , " said george tabakov , chairman of the bulgarian economic forum .
" on the other hand there is still work to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still a big problem in bulgarian society the eu ’ s remaining concerns focus on making sure bulgaria continues reforming its judiciary system and implementing , and not just talking about , changes that make all branches of government less susceptible to corruption .
us ambassador james pardew recently blasted the bulgarian government for not doing enough to prosecute high-level organized crime and corruption , such as when the bbc caught ivan slavkov , former head of bulgaria ’ s olympic committee , trying to influence the 2012 olympic bidding process through bribes .
international networking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy , center , shares a word with dutch counterpart ben bot , right , and slovenia 's dimitri rupel during a meeting of the osce at the palace of culture in sofia , last week demonstrating the country 's desire to play fairly in the international community , bulgaria served as chairman of the organization for cooperation and development in 2004 .
as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
much of the incoming money will be spent dismantling the soviet-era kozloduy nuclear plant by the end of 2006 .
eager trade partner bulgaria is also hoping to profit from increased trade with the eu now that an accession date has been set .
eu members already account for 56 percent of bulgaria ’ s total export sales worth about € 3.61 billion .
just under half of bulgaria ’ s imports , worth € 4.7 billion , came from eu members and in 2003 bulgaria experienced a real gross domestic product growth of 4.3 percent .
though living in what the eu calls a " stable market economy , " the average bulgarian 's income is less than a third of that in eu member states .
the bulgarian labor market is improving and unemployment has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in the first half of 2004 .
with 63 percent of bulgaria ’ s 7.8 million people expressing a favorable view of the european union , it ’ s only a matter of time until sofia becomes an eu capital . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria edges closer to eu membership after successfully wrapping up entry talks with the european union in luxembourg this week , bulgaria is slowly but surely approaching its goal of joining the 25-nation eu club by 2007 .

the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .

the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .
croatia is still a ways behind its more northern neighbors and is awaiting a green light from brussels to begin accession talks . “ i ’ m confident that the eu leaders will approve the accession negotiations and set a date for the signing of the accession treaties in the first half of 2005 , ” barroso said of bulgaria and romania , which are on track to join the eu in 2007 . “ the same goes for croatia , as i assume a date for agreement can be reached on when the accession negotiations should begin , ” he added of the balkan country , provided it agrees to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal . the eu has been pressing zagreb to work together with the hague-based tribunal in the arresting of fugitive war criminals from former yugoslavia .
“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .
a certain amount of uncertainty still surrounds the country ’ s track record and its ability to push through all the necessary reforms by 2007 . the eu commission has set up a strict monitoring process to keep an eye on bucharest ’ s progress in judicial reform , border protection , environmental cleaup , fighting corruption and ending illegal state aid to industry . the european parliament also expressed concerns over romania .
“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .
the accession entry date is by no means a guarantee , officials in brussels stress , with an eye to romania , croatia and turkey . historic moment despite such remarks , the eu summit will be a historic moment for romania and bulgaria , bringing them to the threshold of one of the world ’ s biggest economies , with its promise of prosperity , security and the flowing of billions of euros in development aid to build roads , create jobs and clean up the environment . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu still at odds over turkey croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .

british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .

" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .

if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .
the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .
it had all seemed so much more positive late thursday , when eu leaders were busy trumpeting their historic offer to start membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister balkenende -lrb- left -rrb- and european commission president jose barroso " tonight the european union has opened its door to turkey , " said european commission chief jose barroso , who would be in charge of negotiations . backers of turkey 's eu hopes , also including germany , have long argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east .
" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

but this agreement is being held hostage to disagreement over what happens next .
the united states and saudi arabia are opposed to an eu proposal to hold seminars to talk about the second commitment period . now that the kyoto protocol has been ratified , countries are required to reduce their co2 output by an average of 5 percent by 2012 , and the question remains what sort of measures are needed past that period .
but without the participation of the united states , there is hardly any chance to make great progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factories around the world increase greenhouse gas emissions .
" the first phase of the protocol ends in 2012 ; after that it is unthinkable to go ahead without the united states , china and india , " italian environment minister altero matteoli told reporters in buenos aires . matteoli also caused a stir by calling for the treaty 's end in 2012 if those countries do not sign on .
the statement moved away from the eu 's stance of having a legally binding agreement on greenhouse gas control . standards for developing world when 2012 rolls around , the emerging economies must be included .
it 's critical that those countries be pulled into the fold of the second round of kyoto commitments , stressed kilaparti ramakrishna , a climate change expert from the woods hole research center in the us .
" if we still leave the developing countries out of it , we are not going to be making any progress even if the industrialized countries increase their commitment by another five percent , " he said . but representatives from the developing countries point to the current circumstances today .
" there 's a discrepancy of about 300 to 400 percent between what a person in the us or europe spends on carbon vis-à-vis what somebody in india or pakistan does , " pakistani environment minister malik amin aslam khan said . with growth come catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say floods are increasing due to climate change caused by humans the treaty recognizes that poorer nations do not pollute as heavily as industrialized ones .
but as they advance economically , emission outputs will rise . nevertheless , it 's unlikely that china , india and brazil will be given mandatory reduction targets .
german environment minister jürgen trittin said these countries will be forced to reduce their emissions through other sector specific measures like renewable energy targets and energy efficiency standards . if they choose not to pursue cleaner energy sources , the welfare of the people may be hit in other ways , such as weather-related catastrophes .
in floods and landslides in developing countries , thousands are killed annually and existences washed away . " they should stop the pollution for which the weather is changing and their life is at stake , " said anil kirshna , a minister from west bengal in india , who argued that lives are on the line . the buenos aries conference will not stop the pollution , but the seeds of change may be planted . jennifer macey -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe leads way in climate talks at the climate change conference in buenos aires , the eu has focused attention on the post-kyoto process .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .
today , turkey is the only country that recognises the northern turkish-controlled part as a state and does not recognise the government of the greek south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , right , tried to broker a deal in march an attempt to re-unite the two communities failed in march because the southern greeks turned down a united nations brokered deal .
in may , the eu accepted all of cyprus as a member . turkey has , so far , categorically ruled out recognition of cyprus as long as there ’ s no peace treaty accepted by both communities on the island .
some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .
in return , the greek cypriots would be pushed to start new talks with the turk cypriots . united states diplomats have been heavily involved behind the scenes .
the us wants turkey integrated with the eu and has leaned heavily on the greek cypriots not to block it .
there has also been heavy pressure from britain towards that end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tentative cross-border travel many turkish cypriots are known to be unhappy about turkey ’ s heavy-handedness in the north .
political moderates there have often called for talks with the greeks in the south but been turned down .
very cautiously , cross-border travel is developing between the two communities . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de revival of trade ties remains tricky in cyprus new eu regulations introduced this week allow ethnically divided greeks and turks in cyprus to resume trade ties .

the bulgarian government has implemented nearly all the changes the eu pressed for since accession negotiations began in 2000 .

as an indication of the likelihood of that prediction , luxembourg ’ s foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country will take over the rotating eu presidency in january , announced recently that signing an accession treaty with bulgaria in the first half of 2005 will be one of the eu 's priorities .
treaty to be signed in early 2005 many were surprised at the speedy pace with which bulgaria pushed through brussels-suggested reforms , sometimes even holding extra parliamentary sessions to pass accession-related legislation .
the changes were especially quick to take effect compared to romania , another accession candidate hoping to join the union ’ s fifth enlargement process in 2007 .
while sofia ’ s negotiations ended in june , talks between bucharest and brussels only just concluded last week .
bulgaria 's chances at accession were made independent of neighboring romania 's because of the second nation ’ s slower reform pace .
the eu 's december accession report stressed that bulgaria ’ s accession " should not be linked to that of any other candidate country . "

as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .

states have insisted on education remaining a core responsibility for them but federal government officials had wanted to have a say as well .
the federal system was originally developed after world war ii to secure a balance of power between state and federal governments .
as part of the reform , fewer laws would have required state approval , which has been a problem for the federal government so far .
many bills have been blocked in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , which represents states ' interests . dw-world.de spd and greens take stock of reforms at a two-day meeting near berlin , gerhard schröder urges his cabinet to continue with difficult reforms and to find solutions to make their implementation as conflict-free as possible .

the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

“ the commission believes it is essential that croatia should cooperate with the hague court , ” barroso told reporters on thursday . rocky start for romania whereas bulgaria already completed its accession talks in june , romania has lagged further behind , only just getting brussels approval last week .

“ corruption remains a serious worry … especially high-level corruption .
european parliament members also expressed their alarm at continuing reports on cases of ill-treatment at police stations , prisons and mental hospitals , ” the assembly said in a resolution adopted thursday . given such concerns , the european union has left open a back door - an accession emergency brake of sorts - allowing it to halt the process if it feels a candidate country , is dragging its feet on reforms .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .

the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .

" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .

the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .

" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .

turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .
today , turkey is the only country that recognises the northern turkish-controlled part as a state and does not recognise the government of the greek south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , right , tried to broker a deal in march an attempt to re-unite the two communities failed in march because the southern greeks turned down a united nations brokered deal .
in may , the eu accepted all of cyprus as a member . turkey has , so far , categorically ruled out recognition of cyprus as long as there ’ s no peace treaty accepted by both communities on the island .
some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .
in return , the greek cypriots would be pushed to start new talks with the turk cypriots . united states diplomats have been heavily involved behind the scenes .
the us wants turkey integrated with the eu and has leaned heavily on the greek cypriots not to block it .
there has also been heavy pressure from britain towards that end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tentative cross-border travel many turkish cypriots are known to be unhappy about turkey ’ s heavy-handedness in the north .

states have insisted on education remaining a core responsibility for them but federal government officials had wanted to have a say as well .
the federal system was originally developed after world war ii to secure a balance of power between state and federal governments .
as part of the reform , fewer laws would have required state approval , which has been a problem for the federal government so far .
many bills have been blocked in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , which represents states ' interests . dw-world.de spd and greens take stock of reforms at a two-day meeting near berlin , gerhard schröder urges his cabinet to continue with difficult reforms and to find solutions to make their implementation as conflict-free as possible .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .
today , turkey is the only country that recognises the northern turkish-controlled part as a state and does not recognise the government of the greek south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , right , tried to broker a deal in march an attempt to re-unite the two communities failed in march because the southern greeks turned down a united nations brokered deal .
in may , the eu accepted all of cyprus as a member . turkey has , so far , categorically ruled out recognition of cyprus as long as there ’ s no peace treaty accepted by both communities on the island .
some analysts say that it ’ s too much to expect turkey to recognize a government it perceives as preventing an accommodation between the communities .
possible solutions one way out of the impasse would be for turkey to recognize cyprus indirectly by ratifying extension of the customs union , which includes cyprus .
in return , the greek cypriots would be pushed to start new talks with the turk cypriots . united states diplomats have been heavily involved behind the scenes .
the us wants turkey integrated with the eu and has leaned heavily on the greek cypriots not to block it .
there has also been heavy pressure from britain towards that end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tentative cross-border travel many turkish cypriots are known to be unhappy about turkey ’ s heavy-handedness in the north .

while debate still focuses on turkey , eu commission chief jose barroso said he is confident the bloc will agree to a date for romania and bulgaria to sign accession treaties and for croatia to start entry talks . the head of the eu executive voiced his optimism for the balkan trio at the start of the brussels summit on thursday , which has been largely dominated by debate on turkey ’ s bid to start negotiations on joining the 25-member bloc .
compared to the heated rhetoric over turkey , discussion of the three former eastern european countries has been fairly muted . nevertheless , the general assessment has been positive , particularly for bulgaria , and to a lesser degree romania .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .
3 , 2005 leading to nothing less than full eu membership .
once the talks are completed , probably in a decade , turkey would become the first majority-muslim nation inside what is now a 25-nation bloc , changing the geopolitical face of the eastern mediterranean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : border crossing between north and south the problem for turkey is that it would require ankara to do something it has historically avoided - recognizing the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of cyprus .
the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .
it had all seemed so much more positive late thursday , when eu leaders were busy trumpeting their historic offer to start membership talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister balkenende -lrb- left -rrb- and european commission president jose barroso " tonight the european union has opened its door to turkey , " said european commission chief jose barroso , who would be in charge of negotiations . backers of turkey 's eu hopes , also including germany , have long argued that the country is a vital bridge between europe and the middle east .
" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

eu leaders scrambled friday for a deal to save a crucial summit that has offered turkey eu membership talks from 2005 , after ankara dug in its heels over a demand that it recognize the greek cypriot government . after turkish diplomats indicated they were " disappointed " at the stringent conditions , key eu countries sought to work out a fresh proposal to break the logjam .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his dutch counterpart jan peter balkenende , whose nation holds the eu presidency , met in the morning to take stock of the situation . later , as the eu summit resumed in earnest , it emerged that britain , france , germany , greece and the netherlands were working on a proposal - its details so far unknown - to save the day .
" the presidency has developed a proposal with the agreement of the three big countries , " an eu diplomat said , referring to britain , france and germany .
" the presidency is still working on this proposal . " eu leaders , smoothing over their own divisions , had agreed among themselves over dinner late thursday to offer turkey a start to intensive negotiations on oct .

the mediterranean island has been divided along ethnic lines since turkish troops invaded its northern tier in 1974 , and ankara has refused to recognize anything other than the turkish cypriot government . ankara unhappy a turkish diplomat said friday that ankara was disappointed by the eu demands , and said he saw only " slim chances " of agreement .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose government is one of turkey 's strongest supporters in the eu , told bbc radio that it was " not clear " ankara could accept them . the cyprus issue has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks to turkey 's hopes of seeing its four-decade drive to be embraced into the european family bear fruit .

" it is fundamentally a european nation and it needs to be in europe , " straw said . but critics have maintained their doubts over the 25-nation bloc 's ability to absorb a huge , largely agrarian country with a population of more than 70 million .
they had called for ankara to be offered a " privileged partnership " as an alternative to full eu membership , should negotiations fail . in the end a compromise was found to say that if negotiations broke down , " it must be ensured that -lrb- turkey -rrb- is fully anchored in the european structures through the strongest possible bond , " according to a draft text of the summit conclusions .
turkish press skeptical the mood in friday 's turkish press was gloomy .
" cyprus crisis with the eu , " headlined the liberal turkish daily radikal , saying it had " cast a cloud over the date for accession talks that ankara has awaited for years . "
according to yeni safak , a turkish daily close to the government , erdogan has prepared two alternative speeches for the end of the eu summit .
if a compromise was found , he would thank the eu for making a decision that would help prevent " the clash of civilizations , " it reported .
if not , he would reject the proposal and hint at freezing relations between ankara and brussels . separately , eu leaders agreed to ask bulgaria and romania to sign accession treaties in april next year , with a view to joining in january 2007 provided they pursue their reform process .
croatia was given hope in the longer term , with a proposed start date for membership talks also in april , provided it gives " full cooperation " with the un war crimes court in the hague which wants to prosecute a retired croatian general over crimes during the 1991-1995 balkans conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth read about the discussion surrounding turkey 's eu bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2004 budget wrangling at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the eu does n't come cheap with all the talk of turkey 's bid to join the eu , it 's easy to forget there are other issues on the agenda at the summit in brussels .
the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

the invasion was ostensibly because the military dictators then in control in athens wanted to annex cyprus to greece - most of the people in the south of the island were ethnic greeks . more than 35,000 cypriots still live in the north , though turkey has encouraged settlement by mainland turks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.12.2004 budget wrangling at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says the eu does n't come cheap with all the talk of turkey 's bid to join the eu , it 's easy to forget there are other issues on the agenda at the summit in brussels .
the enlarged union 's budget is one of them . european commission chief jose barroso warned eu leaders , gathering for a summit in brussels on thursday , against short-changing the bloc in negotiations over its long-term financing . addressing calls by the european union 's richest countries to freeze spending over the 2007-2013 budget round , barroso said a sharp hike was needed for the eu to " project a stronger voice worldwide " . " we can not have more europe with less money , " he told a pre-summit news conference , urging the leaders to agree to the so-called financial perspectives by next june .
" without a deal on time , the fulfilment of the political priorities that the 25 member states have agreed to will be delayed .
europe can not afford that to happen , " he added . debate to reach critical mass in january bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who should foot the bill for the eu ?
the six biggest contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but barroso 's eu executive wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni to take into account ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members . the financial perspectives debate is expected to come to a head under after luxembourg takes over the union 's rotating presidency in january .
if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next presidency under britain will be unable to agree on the spending round in time , given london 's fierce defence of its own financial interests in the eu . stability pact reforms expected probably in march , the luxembourg presidency is also expected to unveil reforms to the eu 's stability and growth pact , the budget rules underpinning the euro . barroso noted that italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was likely to raise his own demands for the pact 's reform at the brussels summit , which go further than fiscal hardliners in brussels are prepared to accept .
" i assure you the commission will take a very firm role in that debate , " he said . " for me and the commission , it is important that this pact is credible and that the rules are applied in full respect of the treaty for all member states , regardless of their dimension or their economic development , " he said . the european parliament in strasbourg meanwhile approved a 2005 budget for the eu that foresees expenditure of € 106.3 billion -lrb- $ 142.7 billion -rrb- , a compromise between the demands of the commission and member states . dw staff / afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meets to mull turkish membership european union leaders are widely expected to give accession talks with turkey a green light during a two-day summit in brussels that starts on thursday .

16 , 2004 -rrb- eu still at odds over turkey foreign ministers from the european union are in brussels discussing the upcoming decision on entering talks with turkey over future membership in the eu .

in an interview published in the company 's in-house magazine on thursday , schrempp promised to turn things around in 2005 . " i 'm not promising too much when i tell you that we will get a grip on the challenges within a year , " schrempp said .
" we will do everything that is necessary to become number one again , we have to act and we must improve . " in the past year , problems have plagued daimlerchrysler , which includes the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands .
particularly at mercedes , the poor reliability of some models helped contribute to an overall third quarter drop in profits 62 percent , down to € 304 million -lrb- $ 403 million -rrb- , at the mercedes car group -lrb- mcg -rrb- . schrempp also conceded in the interview that overall operating profits for the entire year might fall below expectations . many reasons for decline given bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes has gone on a " new model offensive " " we have analyzed the causes and problems , and we have prepared corrective measures and solutions , " said schrempp .
" we will work under a great pressure to implement them . " among the reasons for the profit decline , schrempp sited decreased consumer confidence resulting from reliability problems , the introduction of new models , the rising cost of oil , the strong euro and the continuing poor performance of the smart brand . but daimlerchrysler was on the case , he stressed , pointing to a recent " quality offensive " to address the reliability problems .
he promised daimler would invest heavily to improve the quality of new models at mercedes , which have fallen from being one of the most reliable car brands in surveys to one of the worst , and re-educate dealerships to raise service standards . complex issues plague luxury giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers hit the streets to strike on july like many german car makers , mercedes has struggled in recent times .
the company stands at a crossroads , as increased competition from japanese competitors and the rising cost of " made in germany " produced luxury vehicles has forced management to carefully consider the future . in july , labor unrest and strikes were prompted by the management 's threat to move production of the new c-class sedan to south africa if personal costs at the sindelfingen factory were not cut by € 500 million . though not directly mentioned in schrempp 's interview , ways to keep the high cost of producing cars in germany below the revenue threshold will likely be another issue in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars drop in reliability ratings already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable .

starting in early 2005 , there will be a permanent deposit of 25 euro cents -lrb- $ 0.33 -rrb- on all bottles of beer , water and soft drinks .
as of early 2006 , all exceptions for ice tee , non-carbonated sport drinks and alcopops – fruit flavored alcoholic beverages – will be removed .

the law ’ s passage gained impetus earlier in the week when the european court of justice ruled the previous packaging and deposit system infringed upon eu guidelines on fair competition because it disadvantaged non-german companies , who did not have the same restrictions .
environment minister jürgen trittin , who has lobbied extensively for the law , welcomed the bundesrat vote , saying it paved the way for a universal national recycling system in keeping with eu guidelines .

in an interview published in the company 's in-house magazine on thursday , schrempp promised to turn things around in 2005 . " i 'm not promising too much when i tell you that we will get a grip on the challenges within a year , " schrempp said .
" we will do everything that is necessary to become number one again , we have to act and we must improve . " in the past year , problems have plagued daimlerchrysler , which includes the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands .
particularly at mercedes , the poor reliability of some models helped contribute to an overall third quarter drop in profits 62 percent , down to € 304 million -lrb- $ 403 million -rrb- , at the mercedes car group -lrb- mcg -rrb- . schrempp also conceded in the interview that overall operating profits for the entire year might fall below expectations . many reasons for decline given bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes has gone on a " new model offensive " " we have analyzed the causes and problems , and we have prepared corrective measures and solutions , " said schrempp .
" we will work under a great pressure to implement them . " among the reasons for the profit decline , schrempp sited decreased consumer confidence resulting from reliability problems , the introduction of new models , the rising cost of oil , the strong euro and the continuing poor performance of the smart brand . but daimlerchrysler was on the case , he stressed , pointing to a recent " quality offensive " to address the reliability problems .
he promised daimler would invest heavily to improve the quality of new models at mercedes , which have fallen from being one of the most reliable car brands in surveys to one of the worst , and re-educate dealerships to raise service standards . complex issues plague luxury giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers hit the streets to strike on july like many german car makers , mercedes has struggled in recent times .
the company stands at a crossroads , as increased competition from japanese competitors and the rising cost of " made in germany " produced luxury vehicles has forced management to carefully consider the future . in july , labor unrest and strikes were prompted by the management 's threat to move production of the new c-class sedan to south africa if personal costs at the sindelfingen factory were not cut by € 500 million . though not directly mentioned in schrempp 's interview , ways to keep the high cost of producing cars in germany below the revenue threshold will likely be another issue in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars drop in reliability ratings already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable .

as a member of nato , bulgarian soldiers are deployed as part of an eu-led contingent in bosnia and herzegovina , and the 450 bulgarian troops in iraq have received praise from us secretary of state colin powell .
" joining the eu will mean an increase of responsibility when every bulgarian citizen becomes a citizen of the eu , " tabakov of the bulgarian economic forum said .
the offshoot of the membership is that bulgaria can expect an increase in development aid .
over the next two years prime minister simeon saxcoburggotski 's government will receive about € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.34 billion -rrb- in eu aid in addition to the more than € 2.5 billion it has received since accession negotiations began in 2000 .
much of the incoming money will be spent dismantling the soviet-era kozloduy nuclear plant by the end of 2006 .
eager trade partner bulgaria is also hoping to profit from increased trade with the eu now that an accession date has been set .
eu members already account for 56 percent of bulgaria ’ s total export sales worth about € 3.61 billion .
just under half of bulgaria ’ s imports , worth € 4.7 billion , came from eu members and in 2003 bulgaria experienced a real gross domestic product growth of 4.3 percent .
though living in what the eu calls a " stable market economy , " the average bulgarian 's income is less than a third of that in eu member states .
the bulgarian labor market is improving and unemployment has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2000 to 12 percent in the first half of 2004 .
with 63 percent of bulgaria ’ s 7.8 million people expressing a favorable view of the european union , it ’ s only a matter of time until sofia becomes an eu capital . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria edges closer to eu membership after successfully wrapping up entry talks with the european union in luxembourg this week , bulgaria is slowly but surely approaching its goal of joining the 25-nation eu club by 2007 .

venkatesh , 25 , was suffering from a genetic neurological disorder and was on life-support .
on wednesday , a court rejected his plea to have his life support system turned off so that he could donate his organs before they were irreparably damaged .
euthanasia is outlawed in india and organ donation may only take place if the donor is declared brain dead .
doctors at the global hospital where venkatesh was undergoing treatment said he died in the early hours of friday because of heart failure .
plea turned down his mother , k sujatha , who was fighting the legal battle on her son 's behalf said she was very sad that her son 's last wish remained unfulfilled .
" i hope my son 's case will force the authorities to review the law relating to organ transplants .
" i hope the law will one day allow terminally ill patients with different medical conditions to donate their organs to help other people in need , " she said .
venkatesh , a former national chess champion , had been in hospital in the southern city of hyderabad for more than seven months , battling duchenne 's muscular dystrophy .
the disorder degenerates the body 's muscles , heart and lungs and he had wanted to donate his heart , kidneys and liver before it was too late .
but both the hospital authorities and the andhra pradesh high court refused his request to turn off his life support system , saying that would amount to euthanasia or mercy killing , which is illegal in india .

and now a west london woman is offering lessons in making your own .
hannah saxton , 25 , runs her chocolate-making workshops which include the history of the sweet treat , from her home in ladbroke grove .
she admits that in this health conscious age she was worried that people would be cautious of learning about the popular vice .
hannah said : " i did think it might be a problem , but you do have the salad and chocolate people .
" that 's what i call them .
they spend their time going to the gym , eating healthily - then they eat chocolate .
i chose chocolate because i love it , because i eat it everyday hannah saxton " and women in restaurants always get a dessert with two spoons , something for them to share and not feel so guilty about . "
hannah gave up her art degree to concentrate on something more creative .
" i chose chocolate because i love it , " she said .
" i eat it everyday and because i thought to myself no-one else does it in london and it 's a really specialist field .
internet course " i 'm the sort of person who , if i have five minutes at a tube station , i 'd go to one of the machines on a platform and buy a bar .
having dropped out of university , hannah was left with £ 2,000 savings to set up her business my chocolate .
at first she worked as a waitress while she spent hours and hours studying the substance , learning its history and how to craft it .
the tools of the trade took up most of hannah 's budget " that was the one good thing about university , " she said .
" it taught me how to study for long periods and learn quickly .
" i bought every book i could find on chocolate and took an internet course in it .
" you can go to france and study but there was no way i could afford that on my budget . "
hannah quite literally gives me a taste of her workshops when i visit her flat , where she hosts some of the sessions .
i am offered two pieces of chocolate and asked to fathom which is ' good ' chocolate and which is ' bad ' .
different flavours considering myself to be somewhat of an expert on the stuff , it is fairly easy .
this is because , hannah explains , cheap , or ' bad ' chocolate , has the cocoa butter it should contain replaced with vegetable fat and has excess sugar .
bad chocolate is brittle and lacks shine due to the way it is made .
chocolate has been around for centuries , hannah says , and was originally drunk by south american tribes .
chocs away ' good ' chocolate : shines should snap cleanly made with cocoa butter ' bad ' chocolate : brittle dull made with vegetable fat and excess sugar tastes of nothing they did not have the tools to separate the cocoa solids from the butter then recombine them to make chocolate as we know it today .
and the health benefits of the bean were well-known with warriors consuming it before a battle .
it was n't until 1828 that the first chocolate bar was produced .
the various implements and dipping tools used in the sessions are quite costly and hannah says she spent most of her original budget on them .
she says chocolate is like wine , with every different type of cocoa bean offering a different flavour , and the way it is dried can also change the taste .
and when asked the question of how to find the ultimate chocolate she gave the answer all chocolate-lovers want to hear .
" you just have to try as many as you can , " hannah said .

this week , david hollingworth of mortgage brokers london & country helps homeowner barry shortt , who has a buy-to-let query .
mr shortt is thinking of renting out his apartment from next august .
his two-year fixed rate mortgage will expire around that time .
is he obliged to switched to a buy-to-let mortgage ?
david hollingworth writes : " a standard mortgage for your own home will be offered on the basis that the property is your main residence , not for business purposes or for letting out .
when you are ready to let the property out you should therefore inform your existing lender and gain their consent .
do you have a question ?
send your questions to our experts often a lender will allow the property to be let , charge you an administration charge and leave the mortgage on the same interest rate , but they are fully entitled to increase the rate you will pay .
they will insist that the tenancy is formalised with an " assured shorthold tenancy " .
this is a tenancy agreement setting out the rights of the tenant and landlord and is usually for a six-month period .
if you do not inform the lender and do not seek their consent to let the property , then you will be in breach of the terms of your mortgage .
this rule applies to all residential mortgages .
in theory , the lender could refuse to let it out and require you to pay the money back .
then , you would be forced to go elsewhere and remortgage to a buy-to-let deal .
more realistically , though , the lender will want to hang onto your business - and there should n't be a problem as long as you tell them .
higher rates mortgage rates for owner-occupiers are cheaper than buy-to-let deals , typically by between a half to a full percentage point .
buy-to-let mortgages are more expensive because they are a greater risk for the lender : the chances of someone stopping payments of the mortgage on the roof over their own head is smaller than on a property that they are letting out or struggling to find tenants for .
it is therefore worth shopping around .
the level of borrowing available on a buy-to-let mortgage is calculated in a different way to a normal mortgage .
it will be based on the expected rental income rather than the borrower 's salary .
lenders are looking for a comfortable margin of rental income above the mortgage interest payments .
extra costs buy-to-let products are also only available up to a maximum of 85 % of the property value -lrb- although northern rock has just announced it can go to 87 % -rrb- .
be sure to factor in switching costs , such as legal and valuation fees , when looking at a buy-to-let deal .
many lenders now offer help with these costs on certain products so you need to work out if a deal offering lower costs but a slightly higher rate will work out cheaper or vice versa .
if you think you might return to your home after a year or so then you should opt for a deal that will not lock you in so that you can switch to the best rates if you move back .
it is also important to ensure you tell your insurance company otherwise your buildings and contents insurance may not cover you against any eventuality . "

one careless owner , who may sue the successful buyer .
price : surprisingly low to the right bidder .
non-russians need not apply .
tempted ?
probably not , but then the russian government is n't really looking to draw a crowd to the 19 december auction of yuganskneftegas .
three companies are interested in yuganskneftegas ; another may pitch in at the last minute ; but the likeliest winner - gas monopoly gazprom - is not in serious doubt .
much has been made of the political implications of the hounding of yukos , the company that owns yuganskneftegas .
in fact , the real interest is economic : the dismantling of yukos and the aggrandizement of gazprom are just part of the biggest shake-up in the russian oil business in more than a decade .
close call this weekend 's auction is not exactly a nail-biter .
one bidder is gazprom , possibly backed by a syndicate of western investment banks .
two other potential bidders - intercom and first venture - are reckoned by the sporadically-informative moscow rumour mill to be fronts either for gazprom or surgutneftegas , a loyal oil firm which may join in to make up the numbers .
the starting price is some $ 8.6bn -lrb- £ 4.4bn ; 6.4bn euros -rrb- roughly half the official government valuation of yuganskneftegas , and well below the $ 20bn minimum that yukos is sticking to .
yukos , which depends on yuganskneftegas for 60 % of its output , tried to scupper the sale with a declaration of bankruptcy in a us court .
but even yukos ' supporters are holding out little hope : tim osborne of menatep , which represents yukos shareholders , said : " i still think that the auction will go ahead and that it will be sold at the price that everybody 's talking about . "
wicked , or incompetent ?
most commentators on the affair , particularly in the west , have tended to focus on the political .
two main theories are in circulation : is putin pulling the strings , or a helpless bystander ?
the conspiracy theory argues that president vladimir putin hates yukos , and especially its founder , mikhail khodorkovsky , because of their support of opposition parties .
fundamentally suspicious of big business , mr putin has chased out or brought to heel the clique of " oligarchs " that ruled the roost under his predecessor , boris yeltsin .
yukos proved an unusually awkward customer , and so is being dealt with especially harshly .
the implication of this theory is that yukos is only the most egregious of many cases ; other businesses will be brought to book , if not necessarily for funding opposition parties than for not toeing the kremlin 's line .
a recent decision to insist on payment of back taxes by mobile operator vimpelcom has been held up as the next case study .
the cock-up theory , meanwhile , is similar in the sense of seeing a politically-inspired government campaign against the oligarchs .
but it attributes the curiously protracted and secretive campaign against yukos to a struggle for influence and money among various groups .
mr putin , the theory goes , is not directing matters , because events have spiralled beyond the government 's control .
cold comfort neither theory is especially comforting for russian business .
the government is either wicked or incompetent , or both .
as yukos shrinks , gazprom gets bigger more persuasive , however , is a third explanation - one which has , if anything , even more troubling implications for economic reform .
on 2 november , gazprom registered a new subsidiary , gazpromneft , whose purpose was to gather together the firm 's modest oil resources .
-lrb- in 2003 , the company produced just 16,000 barrels per day of oil , less than 1 % of the output of yukos . -rrb-
gazpromneft is to be the vehicle for the previously-announced takeover of rosneft , a once-mighty state oil producer now reduced to medium size .
building a champion the merger of gazprom and rosneft will have three main effects .
first , it will create a company with the potential to produce one million barrels per day of oil within the next few years .
second , it will leave gazprom fully state-owned , diluting private shareholders - currently 62 % of the total - to a minority .
third , gazpromneft will be the perfect vehicle for the takeover of yuganskneftegas , which will double its potential output and make it the country 's biggest oil producer by far .
money talks the question is why .
the kremlin insists its interference in the sector is minimal , and that oil companies are simply consolidating in response to global pressures in the industry .
this strikes most observers as disingenuous .
" companies like rosneft do n't buy a new photocopier without asking the government first , " sneers one analyst .
from moscow 's point of view , there are powerful economic reasons for consolidation .
the energy business is booming : a recent world bank report found that profit margins in the russian oil sector were up to 36 % , and 64 % for gas , compared with close to zero in the west .
gazprom , behemoth though it is , is being chipped away at by hungry private firms , whose share of gas production has risen from 8 % to 12 % in the past five years .
gazprom 's mature gasfields are in decline : to replenish production , it needs access to the plentiful gas produced - and in many cases , simply burned off - by oil companies .
power games there is a bigger dimension , too .
russia has long used its dominance of the ex-soviet energy infrastructure - pipelines and pumping stations , storage deports , refineries and ports - to exert control over its neighbours .
private firms are the main source of growth in russian oil under mr putin , these measures have been emphasised : he has , for example , signed deals to route almost all present and future energy exports from kazakhstan and turkmenistan .
increased muscle for gazprom means increased geopolitical influence , the theory goes .
and with europe heavily reliant on energy imports - the new east european eu members buy 75 % of their gas and 80 % of their oil from russia - russia will increasingly be able to exert that influence westward .
back to the ussr fair enough , up to a point .
all governments fret about their energy security , especially since september 11 , 2001 .
the west might be relieved that its energy imports are to come from a solid , massively-capitalised gazprom than from a rabble of flakey privateers .
but for those looking for progress from mr putin , the development is a dismal one .
russia spent much of the first half of the 1990s dismantling its state oil apparatus , and then gathering the fragments into more or less viable corporations .
now , that process seems to be going into reverse .
a return to quasi-ministerial control would be a blow to the industry 's efficiency , and is scarcely calculated to spread the wealth of the industry most efficiently to the areas that need it .
nor is yukos expected to be the end of gazprom 's ambitions : an obvious next step would be to absorb transneft , russia 's vastly influential pipeline monopoly .
the fall of yukos was the story of 2004 ; next year , it will be the rise of gazprom .

price : surprisingly low to the right bidder .
non-russians need not apply .
tempted ?
probably not , but then the russian government is n't really looking to draw a crowd to the 19 december auction of yuganskneftegas .
three companies are interested in yuganskneftegas ; another may pitch in at the last minute ; but the likeliest winner - gas monopoly gazprom - is not in serious doubt .
much has been made of the political implications of the hounding of yukos , the company that owns yuganskneftegas .
in fact , the real interest is economic : the dismantling of yukos and the aggrandizement of gazprom are just part of the biggest shake-up in the russian oil business in more than a decade .
close call this weekend 's auction is not exactly a nail-biter .
one bidder is gazprom , possibly backed by a syndicate of western investment banks .
two other potential bidders - intercom and first venture - are reckoned by the sporadically-informative moscow rumour mill to be fronts either for gazprom or surgutneftegas , a loyal oil firm which may join in to make up the numbers .
the starting price is some $ 8.6bn -lrb- £ 4.4bn ; 6.4bn euros -rrb- roughly half the official government valuation of yuganskneftegas , and well below the $ 20bn minimum that yukos is sticking to .
yukos , which depends on yuganskneftegas for 60 % of its output , tried to scupper the sale with a declaration of bankruptcy in a us court .
but even yukos ' supporters are holding out little hope : tim osborne of menatep , which represents yukos shareholders , said : " i still think that the auction will go ahead and that it will be sold at the price that everybody 's talking about . "
wicked , or incompetent ?
most commentators on the affair , particularly in the west , have tended to focus on the political .
two main theories are in circulation : is putin pulling the strings , or a helpless bystander ?
the conspiracy theory argues that president vladimir putin hates yukos , and especially its founder , mikhail khodorkovsky , because of their support of opposition parties .
fundamentally suspicious of big business , mr putin has chased out or brought to heel the clique of " oligarchs " that ruled the roost under his predecessor , boris yeltsin .
yukos proved an unusually awkward customer , and so is being dealt with especially harshly .
the implication of this theory is that yukos is only the most egregious of many cases ; other businesses will be brought to book , if not necessarily for funding opposition parties than for not toeing the kremlin 's line .
a recent decision to insist on payment of back taxes by mobile operator vimpelcom has been held up as the next case study .
the cock-up theory , meanwhile , is similar in the sense of seeing a politically-inspired government campaign against the oligarchs .
but it attributes the curiously protracted and secretive campaign against yukos to a struggle for influence and money among various groups .
mr putin , the theory goes , is not directing matters , because events have spiralled beyond the government 's control .
cold comfort neither theory is especially comforting for russian business .
the government is either wicked or incompetent , or both .
as yukos shrinks , gazprom gets bigger more persuasive , however , is a third explanation - one which has , if anything , even more troubling implications for economic reform .
on 2 november , gazprom registered a new subsidiary , gazpromneft , whose purpose was to gather together the firm 's modest oil resources .
-lrb- in 2003 , the company produced just 16,000 barrels per day of oil , less than 1 % of the output of yukos . -rrb-
gazpromneft is to be the vehicle for the previously-announced takeover of rosneft , a once-mighty state oil producer now reduced to medium size .
building a champion the merger of gazprom and rosneft will have three main effects .
first , it will create a company with the potential to produce one million barrels per day of oil within the next few years .
second , it will leave gazprom fully state-owned , diluting private shareholders - currently 62 % of the total - to a minority .
third , gazpromneft will be the perfect vehicle for the takeover of yuganskneftegas , which will double its potential output and make it the country 's biggest oil producer by far .
money talks the question is why .
the kremlin insists its interference in the sector is minimal , and that oil companies are simply consolidating in response to global pressures in the industry .
this strikes most observers as disingenuous .
" companies like rosneft do n't buy a new photocopier without asking the government first , " sneers one analyst .
from moscow 's point of view , there are powerful economic reasons for consolidation .

the conspiracy theory argues that president vladimir putin hates yukos , and especially its founder , mikhail khodorkovsky , because of their support of opposition parties .
fundamentally suspicious of big business , mr putin has chased out or brought to heel the clique of " oligarchs " that ruled the roost under his predecessor , boris yeltsin .
yukos proved an unusually awkward customer , and so is being dealt with especially harshly .
the implication of this theory is that yukos is only the most egregious of many cases ; other businesses will be brought to book , if not necessarily for funding opposition parties than for not toeing the kremlin 's line .
a recent decision to insist on payment of back taxes by mobile operator vimpelcom has been held up as the next case study .
the cock-up theory , meanwhile , is similar in the sense of seeing a politically-inspired government campaign against the oligarchs .
but it attributes the curiously protracted and secretive campaign against yukos to a struggle for influence and money among various groups .
mr putin , the theory goes , is not directing matters , because events have spiralled beyond the government 's control .
cold comfort neither theory is especially comforting for russian business .
the government is either wicked or incompetent , or both .
as yukos shrinks , gazprom gets bigger more persuasive , however , is a third explanation - one which has , if anything , even more troubling implications for economic reform .
on 2 november , gazprom registered a new subsidiary , gazpromneft , whose purpose was to gather together the firm 's modest oil resources .
-lrb- in 2003 , the company produced just 16,000 barrels per day of oil , less than 1 % of the output of yukos . -rrb-
gazpromneft is to be the vehicle for the previously-announced takeover of rosneft , a once-mighty state oil producer now reduced to medium size .
building a champion the merger of gazprom and rosneft will have three main effects .
first , it will create a company with the potential to produce one million barrels per day of oil within the next few years .
second , it will leave gazprom fully state-owned , diluting private shareholders - currently 62 % of the total - to a minority .
third , gazpromneft will be the perfect vehicle for the takeover of yuganskneftegas , which will double its potential output and make it the country 's biggest oil producer by far .
money talks the question is why .
the kremlin insists its interference in the sector is minimal , and that oil companies are simply consolidating in response to global pressures in the industry .
this strikes most observers as disingenuous .
" companies like rosneft do n't buy a new photocopier without asking the government first , " sneers one analyst .
from moscow 's point of view , there are powerful economic reasons for consolidation .
the energy business is booming : a recent world bank report found that profit margins in the russian oil sector were up to 36 % , and 64 % for gas , compared with close to zero in the west .
gazprom , behemoth though it is , is being chipped away at by hungry private firms , whose share of gas production has risen from 8 % to 12 % in the past five years .
gazprom 's mature gasfields are in decline : to replenish production , it needs access to the plentiful gas produced - and in many cases , simply burned off - by oil companies .
power games there is a bigger dimension , too .
russia has long used its dominance of the ex-soviet energy infrastructure - pipelines and pumping stations , storage deports , refineries and ports - to exert control over its neighbours .
private firms are the main source of growth in russian oil under mr putin , these measures have been emphasised : he has , for example , signed deals to route almost all present and future energy exports from kazakhstan and turkmenistan .
increased muscle for gazprom means increased geopolitical influence , the theory goes .
and with europe heavily reliant on energy imports - the new east european eu members buy 75 % of their gas and 80 % of their oil from russia - russia will increasingly be able to exert that influence westward .
back to the ussr fair enough , up to a point .
all governments fret about their energy security , especially since september 11 , 2001 .
the west might be relieved that its energy imports are to come from a solid , massively-capitalised gazprom than from a rabble of flakey privateers .
but for those looking for progress from mr putin , the development is a dismal one .
russia spent much of the first half of the 1990s dismantling its state oil apparatus , and then gathering the fragments into more or less viable corporations .
now , that process seems to be going into reverse .
a return to quasi-ministerial control would be a blow to the industry 's efficiency , and is scarcely calculated to spread the wealth of the industry most efficiently to the areas that need it .
nor is yukos expected to be the end of gazprom 's ambitions : an obvious next step would be to absorb transneft , russia 's vastly influential pipeline monopoly .
the fall of yukos was the story of 2004 ; next year , it will be the rise of gazprom .

council leader roy fisher said the policy will mean regional casinos will " go to the areas where they will bring the greatest benefit " .
the council produced a " masterplan " in 2003 , which relies on the introduction of new gambling laws .
culture secretary tessa jowell said on thursday that the total number of new casinos built nationally would be 24 .
protect the vulnerable it follows last month 's news that the number of the larger " super casinos " would be limited to eight .
but the department for culture , media and sport says the independent panel 's recommendations for casino locations are not expected until the end of 2006 .
tessa jowell 's deputy , richard caborn , said : " the overarching priority of this bill is to protect children and vulnerable people .
" that 's why we 've adopted a cautious approach throughout , listening to the people 's concerns and responding to them . "
blackpool council hopes the introduction of the gaming bill will help it transform the town into a " 21st century world class resort " .
the resort has drawn up a £ 1.4bn regeneration plan which envisages five new super-casinos , creating 30,000 new jobs and an annual income of £ 437m .

ten people will be able to live in the renovated grade ii listed regency building in bedford square , which is being opened on friday .
the first residents are due to move in after the weekend and in time for christmas , organisers said .
downland housing association teamed up with hove ymca on the project .
places are open to people who have already stayed at an assisted hostel , but are not yet able to live independently .
a development of this nature , for single homeless people , is very much wanted linda thomas the housing association said the hove ymca managed two housing schemes where homeless young people could receive one-to-one support from staff , but the maximum stay was nine months , at which stage young people could still find it hard to move to full independence .
the new scheme has been set up so hostel residents can move to the halfway house after gaining basic living skills and developing confidence .
they will be able to stay there for two years after which they can apply to the council for housing , or move into private rented accommodation .
downland spokesman linda thomas said there was a large number of young single homeless people in the city .
" a development of this nature , for single homeless people , is very much wanted , " she said .
the hostel , which includes eight one-bed flats and one two-bedroom flat , with shared bathrooms , took nine months to complete .
the building 's interior has been kept to the same layout , with none of the internal walls being knocked down or moved , and the windows have been designed to reflect the original 1830s style , developers said .

acting state premier kevin foley said the shark should be killed , even though great whites were a protected species .
" a large shark in close proximity to the beaches , that is posing a direct threat to human life , should be destroyed , " mr foley told reporters .
but the victim 's father said he did not want his son 's killer hunted down .
" we do n't advocate the indiscriminate killing of any shark , " philip peterson said after visiting the scene where his son nick died .

savage attack peterson was attacked after he fell off a surfboard , which friends were towing behind a small boat about 300 metres -lrb- 980 ft -rrb- offshore from west beach .
witnesses described seeing two great white sharks - one up to five metres -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- long - at the scene of the attack .
but police and rescuers now believe just one large shark killed the teenager .
adelaide 's beaches , normally packed in the christmas holiday season , were quiet in the wake of the attack , as police searched the area for the killer shark .
sea rescue squadron spokesman fraser bell said two sightings had been made early on friday .
" it actually came to the surface and swam under our rescue boat , so we do know it 's still in the area , " mr bell told the french news agency afp .
on friday rescuers also found what they believed to be human remains in the water close to where peterson was killed .
the remains have been sent for forensic testing .

acting state premier kevin foley said the shark should be killed , even though great whites were a protected species .
" a large shark in close proximity to the beaches , that is posing a direct threat to human life , should be destroyed , " mr foley told reporters .
but the victim 's father said he did not want his son 's killer hunted down .
" we do n't advocate the indiscriminate killing of any shark , " philip peterson said after visiting the scene where his son nick died .
nick peterson 's family and friends gathered at west beach on friday , and laid flowers along the shore as an impromptu tribute .
savage attack peterson was attacked after he fell off a surfboard , which friends were towing behind a small boat about 300 metres -lrb- 980 ft -rrb- offshore from west beach .
witnesses described seeing two great white sharks - one up to five metres -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- long - at the scene of the attack .
but police and rescuers now believe just one large shark killed the teenager .
adelaide 's beaches , normally packed in the christmas holiday season , were quiet in the wake of the attack , as police searched the area for the killer shark .
sea rescue squadron spokesman fraser bell said two sightings had been made early on friday .
" it actually came to the surface and swam under our rescue boat , so we do know it 's still in the area , " mr bell told the french news agency afp .
on friday rescuers also found what they believed to be human remains in the water close to where peterson was killed .
the remains have been sent for forensic testing .
thursday 's fatal attack was the third in recent months in australian waters .
a 38-year-old man was killed by a shark on the great barrier reef off north-east australia on saturday .
do you live in the area and are you worried about the chance of another attack ?
do you think protected species should be killed in order to safeguard humans ?
endangered species need protection instead of further eradication mike zrobok , queensland , australia the ocean belongs to its inhabitants .
when we enter its realm we are subject to its rules and we are agreeing to take our chances just by entering .
large sharks surround this country and their food supply is being diminished by over fishing .
it 's only natural that they seek alternate food sources .
if my family or friends were on the receiving end i would feel anger towards the fish but i would hope that i could come to my senses and realise that an endangered species need protection instead of further eradication .
mike zrobok , queensland , australia sharks should not be killed for acting naturally in their own environment .
people should accept that they are taking a risk being in the water .
safer areas for surfing and swimming should be created , such as electrical shark repellent barriers .
simon mcfarlane , newcastle , uk i am a native kiwi and have spent many years swimming in australian and nz waters .
people need to accept that the risk of these attacks are remote in the extreme when compared to the daily threats we face , such as road accidents .
not only should these fascinating creatures be protected , but so should we ensure they and other predatory sea life have a sufficient supply of food to avert these kinds of attacks .
it is striking when even the members of victims continually concur with this view .
winton smith , london , uk i support nick peterson 's family in their insistence on not killing the shark .
for one thing , the shark has probably left the area , and there 's no way of determining whether a shark found is the right one .
this is no time for being hysterical .
watching the same news shows with reports of murder , assaults and dangerous driving , i saw that other people are a greater danger to us than sharks .
let 's all take care this summer , wherever we are .
paulo de figueiredo , melbourne , australia i believe that sharks should not be killed if they attack humans .
you are in their domain and so therefore you should respect that .
claire fennell , sydney , australia for every shark you see there are 10 you do n't see ray close , seaford , australia sharks should not be killed for doing what they do instinctively .
having been a surfer for more than 20 years i have seen and been in the water with sharks .
it is a risk but still a very small one .
you have to be unlucky , and for every shark you see there are 10 you do n't see .
instead of killing the shark it would be better to tag it and track it remotely .
perhaps we could learn from it .
we could tell swimmers when to leave the beaches .
eventually it might move onto deeper water anyway .
ray close , seaford , australia i agree with the victim 's father philip peterson .
there should not be indiscriminate killing of any shark .
it 's their environment .
steve , adelaide , australia shark attacks are very rare .
it is much more dangerous driving to the beach .
the sharks are magnificent animals and should be left alone .
it is impossible to identify the correct shark until after it has been killed , by which time it is a bit late .
doug ranson , adelaide , australia i live in adelaide and occasionally swim at nearby beaches .
if swimming alone i always stay close to the shore and keep an eye out for sharks .
i 've never seen one .
i do n't think that one death should provoke a shark revenge killing but if there are other attacks or fatalities in the area in the next year or so then i 'd support a culling .
there are some commercial tour operators in south australia who offer opportunities to swim in protected cages with sharks .
i recently met a british backpacker who was looking forward to this experience .
she said that shark sightings are more or less guaranteed by the tour operators .
if so i wonder whether sharks may be fed to induce them to remain in the vicinity to be swimming companions for the tourists .

it is complicated by predictions that the number of pupils needing school places is expected to fall by 50,000 over the next decade .
a fall in pupil numbers could mean the need for fewer teachers .
nut cymru has called for a guaranteed year of work for new recruits to ensure they do not leave the profession .
' suitable numbers ' a scheme like that has already been introduced in scotland .
education minister jane davidson said the review of initial teacher training provision -lrb- itt -rrb- in wales would seek to " more closely match demand and encourage under-represented groups into teaching " .
she said : " the review of itt provision in wales will focus primarily on how itt course intake targets , courses , and course availability might better deliver newly qualified teachers in suitable numbers appropriate to meet the needs of maintained schools in wales . "
the review is expected to start on 14 march 2005 and to last for some six months , with a written report and recommendations submitted by the end of september 2005 .

by joseph winter bbc news website , africa desk uk home secretary david blunkett has resigned after it emerged that his office had fast-tracked a visa application for his ex-lover 's nanny .
mr blunkett criticised colleagues in an interview with his biographer an e-mail was sent which said the application should receive " no favours but slightly quicker " .
mr blunkett insisted that he had done nothing wrong and his close friend and ally , prime minister tony blair said he had " left government with his integrity intact " .
if an interior minister in most african countries had helped with a visa application for an acquaintance in this way , no-one would have batted an eyelid .
if the details had been leaked to an african newspaper , they would not have seen it as a story - such abuse of power , and far more extreme versions , are taken for granted .
' big boss ' and this goes right to the heart of many of the continent 's problems .
if you are in a position of authority , it is to be expected that you personally , and then your friends , relatives and hangers-on will benefit .
visit the waiting room of most african ministers and there is a long queue of people waiting to see " the big boss " .
readers ' comments on this article they will have a variety of reasons , an aunty looking for some money , a distant cousin who has just left school looking for a job and , in all possibility , the nanny of a girlfriend looking for her visa to be fast-tracked .
the pressure on african ministers is well described by one of nigeria 's most famous authors , chinua achebe in his book , no longer at ease , published in 1960 .
despite starting out with the best intentions as a new civil servant , obi okonkwo eventually gives in to the multiple requests from his extended family , leading to his downfall .
many african wars are fought because one group feels excluded from power in most countries , little has changed since then .
and it is not just ministers , but anyone in any position of power .
i have a good friend who used to work at the airport in one african country .
this meant that whenever i arrived at the airport , he introduced me to the customs officials , who waved me through without the usual rigmarole of searching my bags and asking for a bribe in order to waive some customs duty or other fee .
this may seem like a minor transgression - like mr blunkett 's - but it goes to the heart of africa 's poor governance .
rule of law rules are not the same for everyone .
if you know the right people , you can get a visa quickly .
if not , you go to the bottom of a very long queue .
newly appointed staff in many ministries will be from the same region or ethnic background as the minister and the top civil servants .
a study was recently carried out in kenyan ministries , which found that many ministries were dominated by one particular group .
one businessman in somalia , where there is no government , recently told me that he is not allowed to sell certain goods in kenya because businessmen close to the government have been awarded a monopoly .
rare resignations because being in government leads to such perks , not to mention the possibility of corruption when lucrative government contracts are awarded , people are more willing to take up arms to fight for power .
especially when people from one region or ethnic group feel that they are being marginalised from power .
and once in power , there is a determination to stay whatever the cost .
ministerial resignations remain all too rare , although there is some room for optimism now that a few african presidents have voluntarily left power .
david blunkett 's error was nothing compared to the corruption in some governments but the fact that he had to resign should be seized on by those campaigning for better governance in africa .
what do you think ?
would a minister in your country resign over this issue ?
would such behaviour be expected or are things changing ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments .
a selection will be published and read out on the bbc 's focus on africa programme at 1705 gmt on 18 december .
resign ?
what 's that word ?
olu akinmade , no way this is far too over blown by the press in the uk ... so a minister has used public office for personal gain . everyone does it . how much time effort has an enquiry into this matter taken ? ? ? ?
eriq muthemba , nairobi , kenya in tanzania , during nyerere 's era we had several resignations and ministers were held responsible.even now several ministers have resigned even if their mistakes were committed by their juniors.if a minister can not resign then the president has to sack him or her.though this is not the case always but at least we have seen people taking responsibility for scandals however we have to conguratualate david blunket for taking responsibility regardless of the truth on the issue .
similarly the british media needs special credit on how they handle home issues .
emmaus bandekile mwamakula , tanzanian -lrb- redcliffe college , gloucester , england -rrb- well from the experiences here in tanzania , i must say , that issue wouldnt have lead to resignition .
we have seen ministers here holding their positions even after loss of lifes eg .
mv bukoba tragedy masatu , fimboyamnyonge , tanzania i understand mr. winter 's concern for good governance -lrb- or the lack of it -rrb- and the need to redress such issues in certain countries .
i do not however see the link between blunkett 's blunder and the situation in some african states .
firstly , blunkett did not admit to any wrong doing and only resigned , honorably , in order not to disgrace the government .
secondly , the link between nepotism and civil war in african states is somewhat far-fetched .
the two biggest cases in africa : ruwanda and sudan are examples where those in power terrorise the weaker , not of the weaker taking up arms against hegemonic rulers .
zwelithini simela , bremen , germany nepotism exists everywhere , do n't highlight this as if it were only an african problem. thato , cambridge , usa it is in bad taste to compare the case in britain with the african experience .
first , there is untold suffering in most african countries that anybody who is working , leave alone a minister or an mp , is expected necessarily to help his or her community .
again , most african countries are communitarian , it does not help to wallow in riches while your neighbour is sleeping on an empty stomach .
we define our humanhood by the way we are integrated into the society .
it has a lot of meaning to our wellbeing .
the case with blunkett 's resignation does not hit me as a person who did so out of character but out of pressure .
there is a big difference here and the media must highlight such divergence .
if he was of good character , he could not have waited that long to call it a day. joseph okech , kenya , in texas this is the most stupid comparison the bbc has ever made .
it is like comparing goats ' food with lions ' one .
sintoiya ole lekumbai , nairobi , kenya in nigeria that type of attitude will draw laughter , and even scorn from most people , especially his tribesmen , including those in the media itself.personally i do n't think the president will even accept a resignation of a minister who is caught in a minor scandal , especially if the minister holds a crucial post , or is a prominent party member like mr blunkett .
uche ibemere , lagos , nigeria it has never happened under this cameroon 's present regime , for a minister to resign - no matter the depth his mismanagement .
only the " self-powered " president decides if you should leave or otherwise .
in cameroon , a minister will never resign on this issue. akere , aarhus , dk people need to stop been so maopic and narrow minded as to think this kind of corruption only happens in africa .
look west and see how much rumsfeld and george bush 's government has gotten away with murder and is still there .
this is not an african problem , its a problem of the world of power kenneth mwase , harare zimbabwe what the former cabinet minister did was wrong and it is good he resigned from office .
this is intolrable in present ethiopia and such things do not take place openly .
the prime minister of ethiopia and the smart ethiopian political leadership would have simply have kicked or even sent to jail to a person like blunket .
what he did was really morally wrong and not acceptable in ethiopia .
alemuye , addis , ethiopia the real reason for the impunity of some african leaders is that both they and their ill-gotten gains are very , very safe in the western european societies that cynically criticise " african corruption " .
doye agama , uk winter 's concern for africa , s poor governance is appreciated .
such climate as nepotism exists in africa .
however helping out illegal immigrant nanny 's and other bigbrother favoritism among friends and cliques are far more common in today 's usa .
ifeanyi ughanze , houston , texas it is not only africa that this happens .
here in the usa any good political contributor would expect the same sort of access and favours from the person they contributed to .
visa and greencard queues can be jumped in the usa if you know someone .
mike thompson , fairfax , va usa in uganda , that would n't have come to the media .
by our standards that is a non-issue. mukiibi , kampala-uganda l have n't heard of such resignation in africa .
power and position is constantly abused to create personal wealth .
there is hardly any form of accountability .
hope african leaders learn from mr. blunkett. sena aniwa , london , england in zimbabwe the authorities can and do what they want .
they must think blunket mad to have resigned !
the whole point of being in power is to enrich yourself and your family .
the idea that you are there to serve the people is as alien to the ruling party as you can get .
the only time the politicians show an interest in the people is when masses start to show signs of removing them from power !
alex , zimbabwean in uk i do n't think a minister in liberia would have resigned over such a row as " visa favor " .
normally , the public will see it as a sign of great help and perhaps would shower him with praises .
anyone criticizing the minister will be looked at out of touch with the norm of society .
public servants should be above the suspicions of public eyes but unfortunately this is not the case in most african countries .
j duwar kollie , palm coast , fl usa i 've been a resident of the united states for 11 years .
i work for a company involves in contracts with the federal government , and believe me , corruption is widespread in the us too .
who you know makes who you are .
to get a government contract in the us , you must rub elbows with the right people .
white people just do it with more " finesse " .
campaign contributions are a form of legal corruption .
c. ivers , fulton , maryland , usa that is one thing i like with western democracy.maintaining one 's integrity is something african politicians have yet to do , and will unfortunately take a long time to be entrenched .
in kenya , despite many corruption claims , involved politicians are getting stronger by day. weru macharia , kenyan in brighton , this behavior is common in sa , the minister would have gotten a promotion and the nanny would have taken his old position. ryan , jhb south africa it is a natural fact that power is not easily relinquished .
if we think that ministers in western governments are more honourable than their counterparts in african governments , then why did n't mt blunkett resign as soon as the story came out , but he tried to stay in power and twist the fact as best as he could to get out of it .
these things happen everywhere in the world and it so happen that in africa it is not seen as an abuse of power , but merely given a helping hand to those who need your help .
it is a human nature and whether it is in america or britain we know favourtism -lrb- and corruption -rrb- exist .
the difference in africa is that the media will not seize upon it as media in the west does .
more importantly because of poverty and the close knit community that we live in a lot of people depend on the few who have jobs .
banky njie , london / gambia definately not , i think that the ministers in our country might have been debated in the media , but such a trivial thing like this could never have forced a minister to be forced to leave the cabinet , let a lone resign .
jonathan damsgaard , malmoe sweden this type of " corruption " is not only common in africa amongst africans but in most if not all developing countries .
in all of the middle eastern states this is a common practice of govenors down to the traffic police .
it is called " wasta " which basically means having and using connections to obtain special favor .
i have seen the same thing in mexico and asia .
i think this practice is not related to geographic location but rather economic situation .
brian green , dubai , united arab emirates i was quite shocked at the way the british press pushed this issue , in my country , mrs quinns friends and relatives would be entitled to free tickets , use of official cars , in nigeria mr blunkett would 've done the right thing , cos if he doesnt offer this kind of favours his consituency would crucify him , for not taking advantage of his position .
irene , nigeria call it nepotism or network .
it exists everywhere .
its also a way of life and business in asian countries .
lynette chua , singapore i think it would amount to a major wonder of the world if a nigerian minister , governor , senator or any other government offical chooses the path that blunket had chosen- resigning over a mere assistance to fast track a visa application .
given my experiences here in africa i still find it hard to come to terns with the fact that blunkett resigned under such circumstances , even when he did not ' bribe ' anyone nor did he even pick up a phone to make a call to ask for assistance on the visa application .

by joseph winter bbc news website , africa desk uk home secretary david blunkett has resigned after it emerged that his office had fast-tracked a visa application for his ex-lover 's nanny .
mr blunkett criticised colleagues in an interview with his biographer an e-mail was sent which said the application should receive " no favours but slightly quicker " .
mr blunkett insisted that he had done nothing wrong and his close friend and ally , prime minister tony blair said he had " left government with his integrity intact " .
if an interior minister in most african countries had helped with a visa application for an acquaintance in this way , no-one would have batted an eyelid .
if the details had been leaked to an african newspaper , they would not have seen it as a story - such abuse of power , and far more extreme versions , are taken for granted .
' big boss ' and this goes right to the heart of many of the continent 's problems .
if you are in a position of authority , it is to be expected that you personally , and then your friends , relatives and hangers-on will benefit .
visit the waiting room of most african ministers and there is a long queue of people waiting to see " the big boss " .
readers ' comments on this article they will have a variety of reasons , an aunty looking for some money , a distant cousin who has just left school looking for a job and , in all possibility , the nanny of a girlfriend looking for her visa to be fast-tracked .
the pressure on african ministers is well described by one of nigeria 's most famous authors , chinua achebe in his book , no longer at ease , published in 1960 .
despite starting out with the best intentions as a new civil servant , obi okonkwo eventually gives in to the multiple requests from his extended family , leading to his downfall .
many african wars are fought because one group feels excluded from power in most countries , little has changed since then .
and it is not just ministers , but anyone in any position of power .
i have a good friend who used to work at the airport in one african country .
this meant that whenever i arrived at the airport , he introduced me to the customs officials , who waved me through without the usual rigmarole of searching my bags and asking for a bribe in order to waive some customs duty or other fee .
this may seem like a minor transgression - like mr blunkett 's - but it goes to the heart of africa 's poor governance .
rule of law rules are not the same for everyone .
if you know the right people , you can get a visa quickly .
if not , you go to the bottom of a very long queue .
newly appointed staff in many ministries will be from the same region or ethnic background as the minister and the top civil servants .
a study was recently carried out in kenyan ministries , which found that many ministries were dominated by one particular group .
one businessman in somalia , where there is no government , recently told me that he is not allowed to sell certain goods in kenya because businessmen close to the government have been awarded a monopoly .
rare resignations because being in government leads to such perks , not to mention the possibility of corruption when lucrative government contracts are awarded , people are more willing to take up arms to fight for power .
especially when people from one region or ethnic group feel that they are being marginalised from power .
and once in power , there is a determination to stay whatever the cost .
ministerial resignations remain all too rare , although there is some room for optimism now that a few african presidents have voluntarily left power .
david blunkett 's error was nothing compared to the corruption in some governments but the fact that he had to resign should be seized on by those campaigning for better governance in africa .
what do you think ?
would a minister in your country resign over this issue ?
would such behaviour be expected or are things changing ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments .
a selection will be published and read out on the bbc 's focus on africa programme at 1705 gmt on 18 december .
resign ?
what 's that word ?
olu akinmade , no way this is far too over blown by the press in the uk ... so a minister has used public office for personal gain . everyone does it . how much time effort has an enquiry into this matter taken ? ? ? ?
eriq muthemba , nairobi , kenya in tanzania , during nyerere 's era we had several resignations and ministers were held responsible.even now several ministers have resigned even if their mistakes were committed by their juniors.if a minister can not resign then the president has to sack him or her.though this is not the case always but at least we have seen people taking responsibility for scandals however we have to conguratualate david blunket for taking responsibility regardless of the truth on the issue .
similarly the british media needs special credit on how they handle home issues .
emmaus bandekile mwamakula , tanzanian -lrb- redcliffe college , gloucester , england -rrb- well from the experiences here in tanzania , i must say , that issue wouldnt have lead to resignition .
we have seen ministers here holding their positions even after loss of lifes eg .
mv bukoba tragedy masatu , fimboyamnyonge , tanzania i understand mr. winter 's concern for good governance -lrb- or the lack of it -rrb- and the need to redress such issues in certain countries .
i do not however see the link between blunkett 's blunder and the situation in some african states .
firstly , blunkett did not admit to any wrong doing and only resigned , honorably , in order not to disgrace the government .
secondly , the link between nepotism and civil war in african states is somewhat far-fetched .
the two biggest cases in africa : ruwanda and sudan are examples where those in power terrorise the weaker , not of the weaker taking up arms against hegemonic rulers .
zwelithini simela , bremen , germany nepotism exists everywhere , do n't highlight this as if it were only an african problem. thato , cambridge , usa it is in bad taste to compare the case in britain with the african experience .
first , there is untold suffering in most african countries that anybody who is working , leave alone a minister or an mp , is expected necessarily to help his or her community .
again , most african countries are communitarian , it does not help to wallow in riches while your neighbour is sleeping on an empty stomach .
we define our humanhood by the way we are integrated into the society .
it has a lot of meaning to our wellbeing .
the case with blunkett 's resignation does not hit me as a person who did so out of character but out of pressure .
there is a big difference here and the media must highlight such divergence .
if he was of good character , he could not have waited that long to call it a day. joseph okech , kenya , in texas this is the most stupid comparison the bbc has ever made .
it is like comparing goats ' food with lions ' one .
sintoiya ole lekumbai , nairobi , kenya in nigeria that type of attitude will draw laughter , and even scorn from most people , especially his tribesmen , including those in the media itself.personally i do n't think the president will even accept a resignation of a minister who is caught in a minor scandal , especially if the minister holds a crucial post , or is a prominent party member like mr blunkett .
uche ibemere , lagos , nigeria it has never happened under this cameroon 's present regime , for a minister to resign - no matter the depth his mismanagement .
only the " self-powered " president decides if you should leave or otherwise .
in cameroon , a minister will never resign on this issue. akere , aarhus , dk people need to stop been so maopic and narrow minded as to think this kind of corruption only happens in africa .
look west and see how much rumsfeld and george bush 's government has gotten away with murder and is still there .
this is not an african problem , its a problem of the world of power kenneth mwase , harare zimbabwe what the former cabinet minister did was wrong and it is good he resigned from office .
this is intolrable in present ethiopia and such things do not take place openly .
the prime minister of ethiopia and the smart ethiopian political leadership would have simply have kicked or even sent to jail to a person like blunket .
what he did was really morally wrong and not acceptable in ethiopia .
alemuye , addis , ethiopia the real reason for the impunity of some african leaders is that both they and their ill-gotten gains are very , very safe in the western european societies that cynically criticise " african corruption " .
doye agama , uk winter 's concern for africa , s poor governance is appreciated .
such climate as nepotism exists in africa .
however helping out illegal immigrant nanny 's and other bigbrother favoritism among friends and cliques are far more common in today 's usa .
ifeanyi ughanze , houston , texas it is not only africa that this happens .
here in the usa any good political contributor would expect the same sort of access and favours from the person they contributed to .
visa and greencard queues can be jumped in the usa if you know someone .
mike thompson , fairfax , va usa in uganda , that would n't have come to the media .
by our standards that is a non-issue. mukiibi , kampala-uganda l have n't heard of such resignation in africa .
power and position is constantly abused to create personal wealth .
there is hardly any form of accountability .
hope african leaders learn from mr. blunkett. sena aniwa , london , england in zimbabwe the authorities can and do what they want .
they must think blunket mad to have resigned !
the whole point of being in power is to enrich yourself and your family .
the idea that you are there to serve the people is as alien to the ruling party as you can get .
the only time the politicians show an interest in the people is when masses start to show signs of removing them from power !
alex , zimbabwean in uk i do n't think a minister in liberia would have resigned over such a row as " visa favor " .
normally , the public will see it as a sign of great help and perhaps would shower him with praises .
anyone criticizing the minister will be looked at out of touch with the norm of society .
public servants should be above the suspicions of public eyes but unfortunately this is not the case in most african countries .
j duwar kollie , palm coast , fl usa i 've been a resident of the united states for 11 years .
i work for a company involves in contracts with the federal government , and believe me , corruption is widespread in the us too .
who you know makes who you are .
to get a government contract in the us , you must rub elbows with the right people .
white people just do it with more " finesse " .
campaign contributions are a form of legal corruption .
c. ivers , fulton , maryland , usa that is one thing i like with western democracy.maintaining one 's integrity is something african politicians have yet to do , and will unfortunately take a long time to be entrenched .
in kenya , despite many corruption claims , involved politicians are getting stronger by day. weru macharia , kenyan in brighton , this behavior is common in sa , the minister would have gotten a promotion and the nanny would have taken his old position. ryan , jhb south africa it is a natural fact that power is not easily relinquished .

by joseph winter bbc news website , africa desk uk home secretary david blunkett has resigned after it emerged that his office had fast-tracked a visa application for his ex-lover 's nanny .
mr blunkett criticised colleagues in an interview with his biographer an e-mail was sent which said the application should receive " no favours but slightly quicker " .
mr blunkett insisted that he had done nothing wrong and his close friend and ally , prime minister tony blair said he had " left government with his integrity intact " .
if an interior minister in most african countries had helped with a visa application for an acquaintance in this way , no-one would have batted an eyelid .
if the details had been leaked to an african newspaper , they would not have seen it as a story - such abuse of power , and far more extreme versions , are taken for granted .
' big boss ' and this goes right to the heart of many of the continent 's problems .
if you are in a position of authority , it is to be expected that you personally , and then your friends , relatives and hangers-on will benefit .
visit the waiting room of most african ministers and there is a long queue of people waiting to see " the big boss " .
readers ' comments on this article they will have a variety of reasons , an aunty looking for some money , a distant cousin who has just left school looking for a job and , in all possibility , the nanny of a girlfriend looking for her visa to be fast-tracked .
the pressure on african ministers is well described by one of nigeria 's most famous authors , chinua achebe in his book , no longer at ease , published in 1960 .
despite starting out with the best intentions as a new civil servant , obi okonkwo eventually gives in to the multiple requests from his extended family , leading to his downfall .
many african wars are fought because one group feels excluded from power in most countries , little has changed since then .
and it is not just ministers , but anyone in any position of power .
i have a good friend who used to work at the airport in one african country .
this meant that whenever i arrived at the airport , he introduced me to the customs officials , who waved me through without the usual rigmarole of searching my bags and asking for a bribe in order to waive some customs duty or other fee .
this may seem like a minor transgression - like mr blunkett 's - but it goes to the heart of africa 's poor governance .
rule of law rules are not the same for everyone .
if you know the right people , you can get a visa quickly .
if not , you go to the bottom of a very long queue .
newly appointed staff in many ministries will be from the same region or ethnic background as the minister and the top civil servants .
a study was recently carried out in kenyan ministries , which found that many ministries were dominated by one particular group .
one businessman in somalia , where there is no government , recently told me that he is not allowed to sell certain goods in kenya because businessmen close to the government have been awarded a monopoly .
rare resignations because being in government leads to such perks , not to mention the possibility of corruption when lucrative government contracts are awarded , people are more willing to take up arms to fight for power .
especially when people from one region or ethnic group feel that they are being marginalised from power .
and once in power , there is a determination to stay whatever the cost .
ministerial resignations remain all too rare , although there is some room for optimism now that a few african presidents have voluntarily left power .
david blunkett 's error was nothing compared to the corruption in some governments but the fact that he had to resign should be seized on by those campaigning for better governance in africa .
what do you think ?
would a minister in your country resign over this issue ?
would such behaviour be expected or are things changing ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments .
a selection will be published and read out on the bbc 's focus on africa programme at 1705 gmt on 18 december .
resign ?
what 's that word ?
olu akinmade , no way this is far too over blown by the press in the uk ... so a minister has used public office for personal gain . everyone does it . how much time effort has an enquiry into this matter taken ? ? ? ?
eriq muthemba , nairobi , kenya in tanzania , during nyerere 's era we had several resignations and ministers were held responsible.even now several ministers have resigned even if their mistakes were committed by their juniors.if a minister can not resign then the president has to sack him or her.though this is not the case always but at least we have seen people taking responsibility for scandals however we have to conguratualate david blunket for taking responsibility regardless of the truth on the issue .
similarly the british media needs special credit on how they handle home issues .
emmaus bandekile mwamakula , tanzanian -lrb- redcliffe college , gloucester , england -rrb- well from the experiences here in tanzania , i must say , that issue wouldnt have lead to resignition .
we have seen ministers here holding their positions even after loss of lifes eg .
mv bukoba tragedy masatu , fimboyamnyonge , tanzania i understand mr. winter 's concern for good governance -lrb- or the lack of it -rrb- and the need to redress such issues in certain countries .
i do not however see the link between blunkett 's blunder and the situation in some african states .
firstly , blunkett did not admit to any wrong doing and only resigned , honorably , in order not to disgrace the government .
secondly , the link between nepotism and civil war in african states is somewhat far-fetched .
the two biggest cases in africa : ruwanda and sudan are examples where those in power terrorise the weaker , not of the weaker taking up arms against hegemonic rulers .
zwelithini simela , bremen , germany nepotism exists everywhere , do n't highlight this as if it were only an african problem. thato , cambridge , usa it is in bad taste to compare the case in britain with the african experience .
first , there is untold suffering in most african countries that anybody who is working , leave alone a minister or an mp , is expected necessarily to help his or her community .
again , most african countries are communitarian , it does not help to wallow in riches while your neighbour is sleeping on an empty stomach .
we define our humanhood by the way we are integrated into the society .
it has a lot of meaning to our wellbeing .
the case with blunkett 's resignation does not hit me as a person who did so out of character but out of pressure .
there is a big difference here and the media must highlight such divergence .
if he was of good character , he could not have waited that long to call it a day. joseph okech , kenya , in texas this is the most stupid comparison the bbc has ever made .
it is like comparing goats ' food with lions ' one .
sintoiya ole lekumbai , nairobi , kenya in nigeria that type of attitude will draw laughter , and even scorn from most people , especially his tribesmen , including those in the media itself.personally i do n't think the president will even accept a resignation of a minister who is caught in a minor scandal , especially if the minister holds a crucial post , or is a prominent party member like mr blunkett .
uche ibemere , lagos , nigeria it has never happened under this cameroon 's present regime , for a minister to resign - no matter the depth his mismanagement .
only the " self-powered " president decides if you should leave or otherwise .
in cameroon , a minister will never resign on this issue. akere , aarhus , dk people need to stop been so maopic and narrow minded as to think this kind of corruption only happens in africa .
look west and see how much rumsfeld and george bush 's government has gotten away with murder and is still there .
this is not an african problem , its a problem of the world of power kenneth mwase , harare zimbabwe what the former cabinet minister did was wrong and it is good he resigned from office .
this is intolrable in present ethiopia and such things do not take place openly .
the prime minister of ethiopia and the smart ethiopian political leadership would have simply have kicked or even sent to jail to a person like blunket .
what he did was really morally wrong and not acceptable in ethiopia .
alemuye , addis , ethiopia the real reason for the impunity of some african leaders is that both they and their ill-gotten gains are very , very safe in the western european societies that cynically criticise " african corruption " .
doye agama , uk winter 's concern for africa , s poor governance is appreciated .
such climate as nepotism exists in africa .
however helping out illegal immigrant nanny 's and other bigbrother favoritism among friends and cliques are far more common in today 's usa .
ifeanyi ughanze , houston , texas it is not only africa that this happens .
here in the usa any good political contributor would expect the same sort of access and favours from the person they contributed to .
visa and greencard queues can be jumped in the usa if you know someone .
mike thompson , fairfax , va usa in uganda , that would n't have come to the media .
by our standards that is a non-issue. mukiibi , kampala-uganda l have n't heard of such resignation in africa .
power and position is constantly abused to create personal wealth .
there is hardly any form of accountability .
hope african leaders learn from mr. blunkett. sena aniwa , london , england in zimbabwe the authorities can and do what they want .
they must think blunket mad to have resigned !
the whole point of being in power is to enrich yourself and your family .
the idea that you are there to serve the people is as alien to the ruling party as you can get .
the only time the politicians show an interest in the people is when masses start to show signs of removing them from power !
alex , zimbabwean in uk i do n't think a minister in liberia would have resigned over such a row as " visa favor " .
normally , the public will see it as a sign of great help and perhaps would shower him with praises .
anyone criticizing the minister will be looked at out of touch with the norm of society .
public servants should be above the suspicions of public eyes but unfortunately this is not the case in most african countries .
j duwar kollie , palm coast , fl usa i 've been a resident of the united states for 11 years .
i work for a company involves in contracts with the federal government , and believe me , corruption is widespread in the us too .
who you know makes who you are .
to get a government contract in the us , you must rub elbows with the right people .
white people just do it with more " finesse " .
campaign contributions are a form of legal corruption .
c. ivers , fulton , maryland , usa that is one thing i like with western democracy.maintaining one 's integrity is something african politicians have yet to do , and will unfortunately take a long time to be entrenched .
in kenya , despite many corruption claims , involved politicians are getting stronger by day. weru macharia , kenyan in brighton , this behavior is common in sa , the minister would have gotten a promotion and the nanny would have taken his old position. ryan , jhb south africa it is a natural fact that power is not easily relinquished .
if we think that ministers in western governments are more honourable than their counterparts in african governments , then why did n't mt blunkett resign as soon as the story came out , but he tried to stay in power and twist the fact as best as he could to get out of it .
these things happen everywhere in the world and it so happen that in africa it is not seen as an abuse of power , but merely given a helping hand to those who need your help .
it is a human nature and whether it is in america or britain we know favourtism -lrb- and corruption -rrb- exist .
the difference in africa is that the media will not seize upon it as media in the west does .
more importantly because of poverty and the close knit community that we live in a lot of people depend on the few who have jobs .
banky njie , london / gambia definately not , i think that the ministers in our country might have been debated in the media , but such a trivial thing like this could never have forced a minister to be forced to leave the cabinet , let a lone resign .
jonathan damsgaard , malmoe sweden this type of " corruption " is not only common in africa amongst africans but in most if not all developing countries .
in all of the middle eastern states this is a common practice of govenors down to the traffic police .
it is called " wasta " which basically means having and using connections to obtain special favor .
i have seen the same thing in mexico and asia .
i think this practice is not related to geographic location but rather economic situation .
brian green , dubai , united arab emirates i was quite shocked at the way the british press pushed this issue , in my country , mrs quinns friends and relatives would be entitled to free tickets , use of official cars , in nigeria mr blunkett would 've done the right thing , cos if he doesnt offer this kind of favours his consituency would crucify him , for not taking advantage of his position .
irene , nigeria call it nepotism or network .
it exists everywhere .
its also a way of life and business in asian countries .
lynette chua , singapore i think it would amount to a major wonder of the world if a nigerian minister , governor , senator or any other government offical chooses the path that blunket had chosen- resigning over a mere assistance to fast track a visa application .

between those of us who have broadband at home and local businesses , there are now 125,000 broadband subscribers .
that is 200 % up on 12 months ago .
the rapid spread of broadband availability is partly the result of an eu subsidised contract between bt and the government .
this commits the telecoms company to make the service available in all homes by the end of next year .
frank mcmanus from bt , who is responsible for making it happen , said that a year ago 72 exchanges were broadband enabled , covering 50 % of the population .
" now we have 168 done and only another 23 left to do .
that will be completed by the end of february , at which point we will have 98 % of the population in a position to receive broadband , " he said .

the £ 5.7m south west films studios - the region 's first film studio complex - went into administration in october .
the administrator insists the studios do have a long-term future , but only once a new owner has come in with money to invest .
the studios , which date from 2001 , have never been completed .

uk the uk - which has consistently favoured a wider as opposed to more deeply integrated eu - is turkey 's biggest eu champion .

but the dutch are currently in charge of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the country 's prime minister jan peter balkenende has rejected suggestions that the rules should be changed to offer turkey a status beneath full membership as france and some sceptical countries have mooted .

" we should n't suddenly add new criteria .
we should be fair to turkey . "
return to the top germany german chancellor gerhard schroeder is keen on turkey 's accession , and has been pushing for the start of negotiations .
there is , however , opposition to the move at home , amid fears about a fresh wave of immigrants and the eroding of christian values in europe .

france wants turkey to acknowledge the mass killing of armenians from 1915 as a " tragedy " before it starts eu negotiations .

italy is not holding a popular vote on the constitution , and would be unlikely to hold one on turkey .
return to the top greece turkey 's long-standing rival greece has proclaimed its support for ankara 's membership .

click on the map above to find out where some of the key eu players stand on turkey 's bid , and the state of the debate in some of the smaller , more sceptical states .
uk the uk - which has consistently favoured a wider as opposed to more deeply integrated eu - is turkey 's biggest eu champion .
prime minister tony blair has thrown his weight behind an early start to accession talks .
this is also in line with the wishes of washington , which strongly backs turkish membership .
return to the top netherlands the dutch have started to harbour doubts about the desirability of multi-culturalism , and the entrance of muslim turkey into the club has exacerbated some of these fears .
before he left his post , dutch eu commissioner frits bolkestein warned of the " islamisation " of europe if turkey joined , conjuring up imagery from the 1683 siege of vienna by ottoman turks .
but the dutch are currently in charge of the eu 's rotating presidency , and the country 's prime minister jan peter balkenende has rejected suggestions that the rules should be changed to offer turkey a status beneath full membership as france and some sceptical countries have mooted .
" i think we need fair play , " he said .
" we should n't suddenly add new criteria .
we should be fair to turkey . "
return to the top germany german chancellor gerhard schroeder is keen on turkey 's accession , and has been pushing for the start of negotiations .
there is , however , opposition to the move at home , amid fears about a fresh wave of immigrants and the eroding of christian values in europe .
the leader of the opposition cdu party , angela merkel , favours a " privileged partnership " with turkey as an alternative to membership , but this call is thought unlikely to have much of an impact at this stage .
return to the top france president jacques chirac backs negotiations with turkey but , keen that france 's forthcoming referendum on the eu constitution does not turn into a vote on turkey joining the club , has already promised a separate plebiscite on its membership .
to be on the safe side , paris also wants accession negotiations delayed until after the french have voted on the constitution , to be sure that the two issues are not connected .
france wants turkey to acknowledge the mass killing of armenians from 1915 as a " tragedy " before it starts eu negotiations .
it also wants the eu 's declaration on the launch of talks to make clear that turkey may ultimately have to settle for less than full membership .
return to the top austria austria , sceptical about turkey joining , has also been pressing for an alternative status to membership .
like others , it has fears about the impact on the labour market and the culture of europe , but it is thought unlikely to veto the start of membership negotiations .
return to the top italy prime minister silvio berlusconi has said that he wants talks with turkey to begin as soon as possible , although the northern league - an anti-immigration , right-wing party that belongs to mr berlusconi 's government - wants the country 's membership put to a national referendum .
italy is not holding a popular vote on the constitution , and would be unlikely to hold one on turkey .
return to the top greece turkey 's long-standing rival greece has proclaimed its support for ankara 's membership .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis has described turkey 's recognition of cyprus as " an obvious condition " , but at the same time has apparently advised his greek cypriot counterpart not to rock the boat .
greek officials have also hinted at the prospect of a compromise as a way around the dispute .
return to the top cyprus cyprus has warned turkey that it must recognise the greek cypriot government if it wants support for its eu application .
the international community does not recognise the turkish republic of northern cyprus created when turkey seized the area in 1974 after a short-lived greek-inspired coup , and turkey does not recognise the south .
it has recently re-iterated its refusal to do so .
as a newcomer to the club , the greek cypriot government is seen as playing a risky game by staking so much on the chance of a concession from ankara , and many officials harbour doubts as to whether the island will see the threat through .
