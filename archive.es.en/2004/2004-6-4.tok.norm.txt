sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2004 protests and pope greet bush in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors stage an unfriendly welcome for president bush president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .
from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

that photo will cost you five euros checkpoint charlie , the berlin wall 's legendary border crossing is the scene of a new cold war - only this time it 's pitted drama students in east german police uniforms against the curator of the popular wall museum . tourists flooding to checkpoint charlie on berlin 's friedrichstrasse this week were confronted with a strange sight : the control towers , which used to house u.s. soldiers guarding west berlin , were swaddled in blue plastic sheets while people wearing the trademark cap of east german police were walking around draped in toilet paper . the reason for the confusing wrap-up was n't art , but a row between the curator of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , alexandra hildebrandt and a group of drama students . dressed as east german border police complete with jackboots and peaked caps , the drama students were for months apparently charging tourists up to € 5 to pose with them for pictures in front of the former border crossing next to a boxy east german trabant car , the national anthem of former east germany ringing out from loudspeakers behind them . that has infuriated hildebrandt , who is also in charge of running checkpoint charlie .
" we can no longer just watch while this symbol of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- division is abused , " said hildebrandt , whose late husband , rainer hildebrandt established the wall museum during the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last soviet flag at checkpoint charlie checkpoint charlie , the world-famous former east-west border crossing in divided berlin was the scene of tense standoffs in the early 1960s with american and soviet tanks facing each other . in protest hildebrandt has covered the former border crossing with plastic , saying the students did n't have any permission to pose there .
she has also threatened legal action against them . an information brochure in the wall museum tells tourists , " we 'll only uncover the control towers once the undignified spectacle that is being played out around the towers ends . " in reply , the students wrapped themselves in toilet paper thursday to hide their uniforms .
the reason for the choice of camouflage is not quite clear .
but what is , is that it 's definitely not east german toilet paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

that photo will cost you five euros checkpoint charlie , the berlin wall 's legendary border crossing is the scene of a new cold war - only this time it 's pitted drama students in east german police uniforms against the curator of the popular wall museum . tourists flooding to checkpoint charlie on berlin 's friedrichstrasse this week were confronted with a strange sight : the control towers , which used to house u.s. soldiers guarding west berlin , were swaddled in blue plastic sheets while people wearing the trademark cap of east german police were walking around draped in toilet paper . the reason for the confusing wrap-up was n't art , but a row between the curator of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , alexandra hildebrandt and a group of drama students . dressed as east german border police complete with jackboots and peaked caps , the drama students were for months apparently charging tourists up to € 5 to pose with them for pictures in front of the former border crossing next to a boxy east german trabant car , the national anthem of former east germany ringing out from loudspeakers behind them . that has infuriated hildebrandt , who is also in charge of running checkpoint charlie .
" we can no longer just watch while this symbol of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- division is abused , " said hildebrandt , whose late husband , rainer hildebrandt established the wall museum during the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last soviet flag at checkpoint charlie checkpoint charlie , the world-famous former east-west border crossing in divided berlin was the scene of tense standoffs in the early 1960s with american and soviet tanks facing each other . in protest hildebrandt has covered the former border crossing with plastic , saying the students did n't have any permission to pose there .
she has also threatened legal action against them . an information brochure in the wall museum tells tourists , " we 'll only uncover the control towers once the undignified spectacle that is being played out around the towers ends . " in reply , the students wrapped themselves in toilet paper thursday to hide their uniforms .
the reason for the choice of camouflage is not quite clear .
but what is , is that it 's definitely not east german toilet paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "

scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .

the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .
" it 's high time we all got together , " jim weaver , an english nva member in normandy told the daily telegraph . " i say : let -lrb- the germans -rrb- come .
only good can come of it , " english veteran gordon macdonald commented . in france too , chirac 's invitation to schröder had been discussed with veterans , french minister delegate for veteran affairs hamlaoui mekachera said .
" no one was opposed , " he stressed .
world leaders to take part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks through the remains of a floating bridge from world war ii on the beach of arromanches-les-bains , france .
arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .
his father , who he never knew , was killed in combat in romania four months after d-day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british veterans oppose schröder d-day visit some british world war ii veterans are opposed to having german chancellor gerhard schröder visit a british cemetery during june 6 ceremonies to mark the 60th anniversary of the allied landings at normandy .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .

the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

that photo will cost you five euros checkpoint charlie , the berlin wall 's legendary border crossing is the scene of a new cold war - only this time it 's pitted drama students in east german police uniforms against the curator of the popular wall museum . tourists flooding to checkpoint charlie on berlin 's friedrichstrasse this week were confronted with a strange sight : the control towers , which used to house u.s. soldiers guarding west berlin , were swaddled in blue plastic sheets while people wearing the trademark cap of east german police were walking around draped in toilet paper . the reason for the confusing wrap-up was n't art , but a row between the curator of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , alexandra hildebrandt and a group of drama students . dressed as east german border police complete with jackboots and peaked caps , the drama students were for months apparently charging tourists up to € 5 to pose with them for pictures in front of the former border crossing next to a boxy east german trabant car , the national anthem of former east germany ringing out from loudspeakers behind them . that has infuriated hildebrandt , who is also in charge of running checkpoint charlie .
" we can no longer just watch while this symbol of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- division is abused , " said hildebrandt , whose late husband , rainer hildebrandt established the wall museum during the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last soviet flag at checkpoint charlie checkpoint charlie , the world-famous former east-west border crossing in divided berlin was the scene of tense standoffs in the early 1960s with american and soviet tanks facing each other . in protest hildebrandt has covered the former border crossing with plastic , saying the students did n't have any permission to pose there .
she has also threatened legal action against them . an information brochure in the wall museum tells tourists , " we 'll only uncover the control towers once the undignified spectacle that is being played out around the towers ends . " in reply , the students wrapped themselves in toilet paper thursday to hide their uniforms .
the reason for the choice of camouflage is not quite clear .
but what is , is that it 's definitely not east german toilet paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .
gerhard schröder will join jacques chirac , tony blair , george w. bush , and 5,800 other guests to look up in the skies over normandy . cornelia rabitz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .

arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .
" it 's high time we all got together , " jim weaver , an english nva member in normandy told the daily telegraph . " i say : let -lrb- the germans -rrb- come .
only good can come of it , " english veteran gordon macdonald commented . in france too , chirac 's invitation to schröder had been discussed with veterans , french minister delegate for veteran affairs hamlaoui mekachera said .
" no one was opposed , " he stressed .
world leaders to take part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks through the remains of a floating bridge from world war ii on the beach of arromanches-les-bains , france .
arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .
his father , who he never knew , was killed in combat in romania four months after d-day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british veterans oppose schröder d-day visit some british world war ii veterans are opposed to having german chancellor gerhard schröder visit a british cemetery during june 6 ceremonies to mark the 60th anniversary of the allied landings at normandy .

" the message from bonn is action not words , " german environment minister jürgen trittin proclaimed .
the future belongs to energy from sun , wind , water and bio-mass , the green politician said , declaring at the end of the conference that a " new age " had begun . time for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer , executive director of the united nations environment program the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- was charged with monitoring implementation of the action program , which foresees , among other things , cut-backs in subsidies for oil , coal and gas .
china said it would more than double the amount of electricity produced by renewable energies by 2010 , to 10 percent .
along with five other european countries , germany founded a working group under the aegis of the international energy agency to abolish investment restraints to employing alternative energies . the final declaration set the aim of providing one billion people in developing countries with electricity from renewable sources .
german ministerr for economic cooperation and development heide wieczorek-zeul said the projects in the action plan would allow the target to be met . but environmentalists were more cautious , saying that actions must indeed follow words before a new age begins .
" that is more important than the formulations in the final declaration , " jennifer morgan of the world wild fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said . greenpeace expert sven teske was similarly circumspect , criticizing that the need for financial backing had been neglected . " stability pact " on environment unep head klaus töpfer -lrb- photo , above -rrb- caused a stir thursday when he proposed establishment of a " stability pact " on the environment inspired by the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro .
governments should be responsible to meet criteria to lessen environmental impact or face serious consequences , töpfer said . " we are overusing our environment .
we know this is weakening stability for the future , because we need the environment 's services for economic stability .
we know that what we are not paying now coming generations have to pay , " töpfer told dw-radio . " it is a commitment of governments to do their homework .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .
gerhard schröder will join jacques chirac , tony blair , george w. bush , and 5,800 other guests to look up in the skies over normandy . cornelia rabitz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .

but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

" the message from bonn is action not words , " german environment minister jürgen trittin proclaimed .
the future belongs to energy from sun , wind , water and bio-mass , the green politician said , declaring at the end of the conference that a " new age " had begun . time for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer , executive director of the united nations environment program the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- was charged with monitoring implementation of the action program , which foresees , among other things , cut-backs in subsidies for oil , coal and gas .
china said it would more than double the amount of electricity produced by renewable energies by 2010 , to 10 percent .
along with five other european countries , germany founded a working group under the aegis of the international energy agency to abolish investment restraints to employing alternative energies . the final declaration set the aim of providing one billion people in developing countries with electricity from renewable sources .
german ministerr for economic cooperation and development heide wieczorek-zeul said the projects in the action plan would allow the target to be met . but environmentalists were more cautious , saying that actions must indeed follow words before a new age begins .
" that is more important than the formulations in the final declaration , " jennifer morgan of the world wild fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said . greenpeace expert sven teske was similarly circumspect , criticizing that the need for financial backing had been neglected .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .

memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .
" it 's high time we all got together , " jim weaver , an english nva member in normandy told the daily telegraph . " i say : let -lrb- the germans -rrb- come .
only good can come of it , " english veteran gordon macdonald commented . in france too , chirac 's invitation to schröder had been discussed with veterans , french minister delegate for veteran affairs hamlaoui mekachera said .
" no one was opposed , " he stressed .

arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .

" the message from bonn is action not words , " german environment minister jürgen trittin proclaimed .
the future belongs to energy from sun , wind , water and bio-mass , the green politician said , declaring at the end of the conference that a " new age " had begun . time for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus töpfer , executive director of the united nations environment program the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- was charged with monitoring implementation of the action program , which foresees , among other things , cut-backs in subsidies for oil , coal and gas .
china said it would more than double the amount of electricity produced by renewable energies by 2010 , to 10 percent .
along with five other european countries , germany founded a working group under the aegis of the international energy agency to abolish investment restraints to employing alternative energies . the final declaration set the aim of providing one billion people in developing countries with electricity from renewable sources .
german ministerr for economic cooperation and development heide wieczorek-zeul said the projects in the action plan would allow the target to be met . but environmentalists were more cautious , saying that actions must indeed follow words before a new age begins .
" that is more important than the formulations in the final declaration , " jennifer morgan of the world wild fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said . greenpeace expert sven teske was similarly circumspect , criticizing that the need for financial backing had been neglected . " stability pact " on environment unep head klaus töpfer -lrb- photo , above -rrb- caused a stir thursday when he proposed establishment of a " stability pact " on the environment inspired by the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro .
governments should be responsible to meet criteria to lessen environmental impact or face serious consequences , töpfer said . " we are overusing our environment .
we know this is weakening stability for the future , because we need the environment 's services for economic stability .
we know that what we are not paying now coming generations have to pay , " töpfer told dw-radio . " it is a commitment of governments to do their homework .

"
two years in the planning , d-day was a turning point in the war .
on june 6 , 1944 , some 175,000 allied troops landed on five beaches in normandy to take the german troops by surprise .
the bloody battle resulted in 10,000 allied and as many as 9,000 german casualities .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .
" it 's high time we all got together , " jim weaver , an english nva member in normandy told the daily telegraph . " i say : let -lrb- the germans -rrb- come .
only good can come of it , " english veteran gordon macdonald commented . in france too , chirac 's invitation to schröder had been discussed with veterans , french minister delegate for veteran affairs hamlaoui mekachera said .
" no one was opposed , " he stressed .
world leaders to take part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks through the remains of a floating bridge from world war ii on the beach of arromanches-les-bains , france .
arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .
on sunday , bush will head to normandy to help commemorate the 60th anniversary of the allies ' d-day landing . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : drawing the right lessons from history president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

that photo will cost you five euros checkpoint charlie , the berlin wall 's legendary border crossing is the scene of a new cold war - only this time it 's pitted drama students in east german police uniforms against the curator of the popular wall museum . tourists flooding to checkpoint charlie on berlin 's friedrichstrasse this week were confronted with a strange sight : the control towers , which used to house u.s. soldiers guarding west berlin , were swaddled in blue plastic sheets while people wearing the trademark cap of east german police were walking around draped in toilet paper . the reason for the confusing wrap-up was n't art , but a row between the curator of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , alexandra hildebrandt and a group of drama students . dressed as east german border police complete with jackboots and peaked caps , the drama students were for months apparently charging tourists up to € 5 to pose with them for pictures in front of the former border crossing next to a boxy east german trabant car , the national anthem of former east germany ringing out from loudspeakers behind them . that has infuriated hildebrandt , who is also in charge of running checkpoint charlie .
" we can no longer just watch while this symbol of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- division is abused , " said hildebrandt , whose late husband , rainer hildebrandt established the wall museum during the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last soviet flag at checkpoint charlie checkpoint charlie , the world-famous former east-west border crossing in divided berlin was the scene of tense standoffs in the early 1960s with american and soviet tanks facing each other . in protest hildebrandt has covered the former border crossing with plastic , saying the students did n't have any permission to pose there .
she has also threatened legal action against them . an information brochure in the wall museum tells tourists , " we 'll only uncover the control towers once the undignified spectacle that is being played out around the towers ends . " in reply , the students wrapped themselves in toilet paper thursday to hide their uniforms .
the reason for the choice of camouflage is not quite clear .

" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

" fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .
on sunday , bush will head to normandy to help commemorate the 60th anniversary of the allies ' d-day landing . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : drawing the right lessons from history president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .

the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .
it would be " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves , the daily telegraph quoted the head of the normandy veterans ' association -lrb- nva -rrb- as saying . but since then tempers seem to have been soothed .
" it 's high time we all got together , " jim weaver , an english nva member in normandy told the daily telegraph . " i say : let -lrb- the germans -rrb- come .
only good can come of it , " english veteran gordon macdonald commented . in france too , chirac 's invitation to schröder had been discussed with veterans , french minister delegate for veteran affairs hamlaoui mekachera said .
" no one was opposed , " he stressed .
world leaders to take part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks through the remains of a floating bridge from world war ii on the beach of arromanches-les-bains , france .
arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .
it is regarded as a turning point in world war ii . schröder himself was only two months old when allied forces landed in normandy .

" for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .
gerhard schröder will join jacques chirac , tony blair , george w. bush , and 5,800 other guests to look up in the skies over normandy . cornelia rabitz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .
pasta with silvio bush is expected to meet with prime minister silvio berlusconi for a gala dinner on friday .
the italian leader , who has deployed about 3,000 troops to help rebuild iraq , is one of the united states ' staunchest allies in europe .
after spain withdrew its soldiers in may , many in europe looked to italy to follow suit , but berlusconi has held his ground despite vocal protests at home .
on saturday bush will leave for france , where he will work to rebuild ties with president jacques chirac , who along with germany led the opposition to the war in iraq .
bush said he hoped europe and the united states were drawing closer together as iraqis prepared to assume political control of their country at the end of the month .
" as i head over to honor what happened 60 years ago , i think we 're now seeing unity to work toward common good today , " he said in an interview with italian television before leaving washington .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors .

the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .

kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .

arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .

" the message from bonn is action not words , " german environment minister jürgen trittin proclaimed .

germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants . as delegates from 154 nations at the international conference on renewable energy in bonn promoted renewable energy souces like solar and wind power to counter rising oil prices , bavarian premier and leader of the opposition conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber , dished up his own suggestion , topped with an extra serving of controversy . stoiber proposed thursday that rising uncertainty about oil production and soaring prices should be offset by nuclear power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian premier and csu leader , edmund stoiber in a strategy paper on energy policy , the contents of which were made public thursday , stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- urged a fundamental review of a hard-won nuclear energy phase-out accord sealed between schröder 's center-left government and german energy providers three years ago . stoiber demanded an extension of the life-span of currently functioning reactors , a modernization of reactors if needed and if necessary , construction of new nuclear reactors . non-nuclear strategy no longer viable markus söder , general secretary of the csu said on thursday in a german radio interview that there had to be a continuing emphasis on nuclear energy in the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy production based on oil from the middle east . " for us it is clear that we will promote an exit from this policy of non-nuclear power generation .
a non-nuclear strategy is neither ecologically nor economically sound in our opinion , “ söder said . though söder has toned down the demand to build new nuclear reactors , he has admitted that the issue of boosting nuclear energy will be back on the political agenda if the conservatives win the 2006 general elections .
he has also not ruled out that if the conservatives were to come to power , they would see to it that nuclear plants would continue operating for longer than the planned 25-year deadline laid down in the nuclear phase-out treaty . bavarian economics minister otto wieshau said that bavaria would advocate extending the life-spans of " existing , safe nuclear reactors . " fritz vahrenholt , long-time energy expert of schröder 's ruling party and chief executive of wind turbine maker repower ag , said on thursday germany had to do everything to become less dependent on oil .
slowing down the phase out of nuclear power plants was a definite option , he told german radio . proposal too dangerous and illegal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wind mill in brandenburg , germany the proposal of rethinking the future of nuclear energy has riled schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , who have made phasing out nuclear power and boosting support for renewable energies like solar and wind power the cornerstones of their energy policy . in particular the greens , the initiators of the nuclear phase-out agreement , are up in arms .
the agreement foresees a closing down of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors over a period of 25 years and the amount of renewable energy resources is to be increased to 20 percent of total production . the greens ' energy spokesman , rainer loske , said the risks of nuclear power production are no longer permissible in a densely-populated country like germany . " we don ’ t think that nuclear energy can be justified in the long run .
it ’ s too dangerous and there are too many open questions involved in this technology , " loske said .
" so we will stick to this policy and it will not necessarily lead to increasing electricity prices because it is a phase-out step by step . “ schröder 's social democrats have also pointed to the security risks of nuclear reactors as well as the limited availability of uranium needed to produce electricity . german environment minister jürgen trittin has warned the bavarian state government against building a new nuclear power plant , saying such a move would be " illegal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.06.2004 protests and pope greet bush in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors stage an unfriendly welcome for president bush president george bush 's visit in rome brings him face-to-face with the extremes of european opinion on the iraq war .
from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .

from the pope and mass protests to berlusconi , the u.s. leader hears both sides of the issue . he 's just in town for 36 hours and yet the visit is long enough to turn rome into a fortress as police saturate the historic center and heavy concentrations of paramilitary forces guard the main thoroughfares and piazzas against protestors .
the interior ministry has mobilized some 10,000 security forces and just as many , if not more , people are expected to take to the streets to demonstrate against the u.s. position in iraq .
president george w. bush has arrived in italy at the start of a european tour to honor the sacrifices and triumphs of world war ii in italy and france 60 years ago .
but it is the iraq war which plays most prominently in people 's memories today .
inhospitable welcome protestors began gathering on the streets early friday morning , and rail authorities reported that about 1,000 demonstrators had poured into the city from milan .
many office and apartment windows in the city center have been draped with the rainbow-colored peace flags as a message to bush that the italians do not support his policy - and that of prime minister silvio berlusconi - in iraq .
" we 're here to tell bush he 's really not welcome , " a youth with a megaphone said while the first marchers took to the street in eastern rome .
as the bush motorcade rolled through the city on route to a mid-morning meeting with italian president carlo azeglio ciampi , anti-war demonstrators blocked streets and jammed major intersections in an attempt to stop the president 's car .
on the edge of downtown , an angry group of protestors aimed fireworks at a military school , and in outlying districts , several protestors set fire to boxes and blankets , the italian news agency ansa reported .
the official anti-war protest led by the communists and greens is expected for later friday afternoon .
the main center-left opposition parties , who also oppose the u.s. leader 's visit and the continuing presence of troops in iraq , said however they would not take part in demonstrations out of respect for the u.s. soldiers who died in the liberation of rome .
pontiffical protest while bush may be able to roll past the majority of protests , a noon-time meeting with pope john paul ii brought him face-to-face with one of the sternest critics of the iraq war .
it is the their third meeting , and the first since bush launched the u.s. invasion in iraq , despite strong opposition from the vatican .
the holy see had recently issued sharp criticisms of the bush administration 's actions leading up to the war and the abuse inflicted by u.s. soldiers on iraqi prisoners .
on friday the 84-year-old pontiff said the president 's visit to europe comes " at a moment of great concern for the continuing situation of grave unrest in the middle east , both in iraq and the holy land . "
the pope told bush that the situation in iraq must " be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and in particular the united nations , in order to ensure a speedy return of iraq 's sovereignty , in conditions of security for all its people . "
the pope also made a veiled reference to recent revelations of abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. troops in iraq .
" in the past few weeks other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civil and religious conscience of all , and made more difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values . "
in the absence of such a commitment , he said " neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome . "
bush , who described john paul ii as " a devoted servant of god who has championed the cause of the poor , " presented the head of the roman catholic church with the presidential medal of honor , his country 's highest civilian award .

that photo will cost you five euros checkpoint charlie , the berlin wall 's legendary border crossing is the scene of a new cold war - only this time it 's pitted drama students in east german police uniforms against the curator of the popular wall museum . tourists flooding to checkpoint charlie on berlin 's friedrichstrasse this week were confronted with a strange sight : the control towers , which used to house u.s. soldiers guarding west berlin , were swaddled in blue plastic sheets while people wearing the trademark cap of east german police were walking around draped in toilet paper . the reason for the confusing wrap-up was n't art , but a row between the curator of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , alexandra hildebrandt and a group of drama students . dressed as east german border police complete with jackboots and peaked caps , the drama students were for months apparently charging tourists up to € 5 to pose with them for pictures in front of the former border crossing next to a boxy east german trabant car , the national anthem of former east germany ringing out from loudspeakers behind them . that has infuriated hildebrandt , who is also in charge of running checkpoint charlie .
" we can no longer just watch while this symbol of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- division is abused , " said hildebrandt , whose late husband , rainer hildebrandt established the wall museum during the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last soviet flag at checkpoint charlie checkpoint charlie , the world-famous former east-west border crossing in divided berlin was the scene of tense standoffs in the early 1960s with american and soviet tanks facing each other . in protest hildebrandt has covered the former border crossing with plastic , saying the students did n't have any permission to pose there .
she has also threatened legal action against them . an information brochure in the wall museum tells tourists , " we 'll only uncover the control towers once the undignified spectacle that is being played out around the towers ends . " in reply , the students wrapped themselves in toilet paper thursday to hide their uniforms .
the reason for the choice of camouflage is not quite clear .
but what is , is that it 's definitely not east german toilet paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .
for the first time , a sitting german chancellor will be included .
gerhard schröder will join jacques chirac , tony blair , george w. bush , and 5,800 other guests to look up in the skies over normandy . cornelia rabitz -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .

the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .

he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities . " france was liberated from german occupation and we germans from the nazi tyranny , " schröder said in a written interview with reuters tuesday .
" this day is much more than victory or defeat .
it has become a symbol of the struggle for freedom , democracy and human rights .
it is only right that we germans take part . " president jacques chirac invited schröder to attend the june 6 d-day celebrations in france .
" it 's a generous and moving gesture for which i 'm very grateful and whose historic importance can not be overestimated , " schröder said .
" this invitation shows the postwar period is over and done for good . " initially , some news media reported that allied veterans were opposed to the german leader 's presence at ceremonies .

world leaders to take part bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks through the remains of a floating bridge from world war ii on the beach of arromanches-les-bains , france .
arromanches will be the site of the international ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of d-day on june 6 .
schröder will attend a remembrance ceremony on sunday near the town of arromanches along with leaders from 17 countries , including u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair and russian president vladimir putin .
later in the day the german leader is expected to lay wreaths at a british military cemetery in ranville and take part in a franco-german reconciliation ceremony . none of schröder 's predecessors attended ceremonies commemorating the landing of some 175,000 allied troops onto normandy 's beaches in 1944 .
his immediate predecessor , helmut kohl , even made it clear to then-president francois mitterand that he did n't want to be invited to d-day commemorations .
kohl 's older brother died from wounds he suffered fighting in normandy . the storming of the beaches in normandy ultimately claimed the lives of around 150,000 allied troops and 60,000 german soldiers .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .

sixty years later , the d-day landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 is ever-present .
the area has become an important tourist destination for visitors and veterans from throughout the world . cafés in normandy are called " libération " and " six juin . "
museums are devoted to the heroism of the allies .
shops sell tourists toy fighter planes , tanks , flags and t-shirts as souvenirs .
memorials and statues honoring the allied dead decorate the area .
but it 's still difficult to imagine d-day , june 6 , 1944 , on the long , broad utah , omaha , gold , juno and sword beaches that still carry the names given to them by the allies as they prepared their missions .
" when the allies landed it was an hour after low tide .
so they had about 300 meters , about 1,000 feet , of open beach to cover before they got to the sand dunes , " irish guide edward robinson explained . " the beach was covered with anti-landing craft and anti-tank obstacles .
the german defenders had a very good defensive position to fight from .
they had quite high , sandy cliffs , easy to dig into , easy to set up machine gun positions . "
bildunterschrift : a u.s. sherman tank perches outside the war memorial in bayeux , northwestern france .
scars of war huge , ugly cement blocks - the remains of the artificial port the british improvised to allow supplies in - stand just before the beach in arromanches , where the official commemoration ceremony will take place on june 6 .
arromanches is now a lively beach town with cafés and souvenir shops and a pretty promenade .
french , british , american , danish and swedish visitors of all ages flock to see the d-day documentation in the numerous museums . low tide attracts people riding horses and swimmers .
visitors examine the scars : bunkers , military vehicles , bomb craters .
veterans come too , exchanging memories .
for the most part , they 've gotten over the old definitions of who was friend , and who was foe .
they survived , and that 's what counts .
after the war , many devoted themselves to the reconciliation effort . " we had a good relationship to the french people .
and it still shows today , " german veteran alexander uhlig said .
uhlig and others from his parachute regiment travel to normandy every few years , where they visit the places they remember from the war . " there we 're invited for a glass of calvados or cider by some old people who know us from back then - very friendly .
and the french also say - well , they were liberated - but they say : ' as long as the germans were here , everything was in order , " ' uhlig recounted . the war left graves , memorials and cemeteries in normandy .
over 9,000 soldiers are buried at the u.s. military cemetery near colleville , above omaha beach .
white crosses bedeck the graves laid out in geometrically precise rows on closely cut lawns befitting the armed forces .
the nearby cemetery for british soldiers is reminiscent of an english park with its benches and flower beds . the german cemetery in la cambe , in contrast , is a cramped , bleak areal .
more than 20,000 german troops are buried in the dark , shadowy graveyard dominated by a memorial to the unknown soldier .
home of the paratroopers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of an american landing unit help their exhausted comrades ashore during the normandy invasion on june 6 , 1944 .
the men reached the zone code-named utah beach , near sainte-mère-eglise , on a life raft , after their landing craft was hit and sunk by german coastal defenses .
the village sainte-mère-eglise , which claims to have been the first place liberated by the americans , is just a few kilometers away .
the town 's only hotel , " auberge john steele , " is just one indication of how this village commemorates the allied paratroopers .
john steele was an allied soldier who got caught on a church spire while parachuting into sainte-mère-eglise in 1944 .
for fear of the german occupiers , he played dead for hours until he was helped down . raymond paris was a young eyewitness to the arrival of the paratroopers .
" you could see it well , it was broad daylight , " he remembers .
" the doors of the airplanes were open , and out of all these airplanes came the paratroopers - everywhere , americans were falling from the sky . " many of the former liberators kept in touch with sainte-mère-eglise , visiting over the years .
veterans ' clubs and the league of paratroopers donated the church organ .
the late john steele became the village hero - a puppet now hangs from the church spire commemorating his spectacular jump . on june 6 , normandy will be celebrating .
there 'll be much flag-waving , pomp , and ceremony .
the french air force will put on a show of trick manoeuvres .
along with tens of thousands of veterans , leaders from throughout the world will commemorate the liberation . but there 'll be one important difference to all the previous celebrations .

currently , when a doctor thinks the cancer could spread , glands under the arm are removed , as well as the tumour .
but research co-ordinated by cardiff scientists suggests it is unnecessary in two-thirds of cases and they have developed a less drastic treatment .
the procedure could be more widely available throughout the uk within 18 months .
removing the lymph nodes from under the arm is a painful procedure which can result in loss of movement .
research carried out over three years across england and wales found that by removing just one gland from under the arm , specialists can tell whether the cancer has spread .
using a small dose of radioactivity , doctors are able to locate the main gland - called the sentinel node - that drains directly from the tumour . "
i know it can make a lot of difference to women in the near future " cancer patient claire claridge the department of health will fund a training programme for doctors to learn the technique .
professor robert mansel , professor of surgery at the university of wales college of medicine , cardiff , said : " the standard practice at the moment for managing the lymph glands under the arm is that we have to take them all out .
" the reason for that is we need to know whether the cancer has spread to them .
" the new technique allows us just to take the most important node - the sentinel node .
" this means the woman who does n't have any spread only has a very small operation . "
professor mansel is presenting the findings of the trials to the american society of clinical oncology on saturday .
lifetime risk claire claridge was one of 1,000 women who took part in the research team 's trials of the new techniques .
she was one of the 500 who had the standard procedure and has lost some mobility in her right arm as a result of the operation .
she said : " it means you ca n't carry heavy things with that arm even if you 've got the full movement back .
" i have a daughter and if it helps her generation it will please me .
" i know it can make a lot of difference to women in the near future as well . "
in the uk , the lifetime risk for breast cancer in women is one in nine .
it is the most common cancer affecting women in the uk , with more than 38,000 new cases each year .
delyth morgan , of breakthrough breast cancer , said : " women we talk to are very concerned to know whether their breast cancer has spread or not but the removal of lymph nodes can sometimes be extremely debilitating .
" any technique that is less invasive and provides an accurate answer will be welcomed by women with breast cancer .
" it 's important to remember that at the moment , sentinel node biopsy is not yet standard treatment .
" however , we look forward to finding out the results of this trial which , if positive , will help inform national institute of clinical excellence guidance and as a result , make this technique available to all women who could benefit . "

currently , when a doctor thinks the cancer could spread , glands under the arm are removed , as well as the tumour .
but research co-ordinated by cardiff scientists suggests it is unnecessary in two-thirds of cases and they have developed a less drastic treatment .
the procedure could be more widely available throughout the uk within 18 months .
removing the lymph nodes from under the arm is a painful procedure which can result in loss of movement .
research carried out over three years across england and wales found that by removing just one gland from under the arm , specialists can tell whether the cancer has spread .
using a small dose of radioactivity , doctors are able to locate the main gland - called the sentinel node - that drains directly from the tumour .
i know it can make a lot of difference to women in the near future cancer patient claire claridge the department of health will fund a training programme for doctors to learn the technique .
professor robert mansel , professor of surgery at the university of wales college of medicine , cardiff , said : " the standard practice at the moment for managing the lymph glands under the arm is that we have to take them all out .
" the reason for that is we need to know whether the cancer has spread to them .
" the new technique allows us just to take the most important node - the sentinel node .
claire claridge lost mobility in her arm after having glands removed " this means the woman who does n't have any spread only has a very small operation . "
professor mansel is presenting the findings of the trials to the american society of clinical oncology on saturday .
lifetime risk claire claridge was one of 1,000 women who took part in the research team 's trials of the new techniques .
she was one of the 500 who had the standard procedure and has lost some mobility in her right arm as a result of the operation .
she said : " it means you ca n't carry heavy things with that arm even if you 've got the full movement back .
" i have a daughter and if it helps her generation it will please me .
" i know it can make a lot of difference to women in the near future as well . "
in the uk , the lifetime risk for breast cancer in women is one in nine .
it is the most common cancer affecting women in the uk , with more than 38,000 new cases each year .
delyth morgan , of breakthrough breast cancer , said : " women we talk to are very concerned to know whether their breast cancer has spread or not but the removal of lymph nodes can sometimes be extremely debilitating .
" any technique that is less invasive and provides an accurate answer will be welcomed by women with breast cancer .
" it 's important to remember that at the moment , sentinel node biopsy is not yet standard treatment .
" however , we look forward to finding out the results of this trial which , if positive , will help inform national institute of clinical excellence guidance and as a result , make this technique available to all women who could benefit . "

in his own words it " gets more difficult as you go on as prime minister " - but he 's still insisting he 's " absolutely up for it " .
as part of our election coverage , we 've been speaking to the party leaders .
tony blair joined us live in the studio , on friday 's breakfast .
click here to watch tony blair .
we asked him about the tough time he admits he has ahead - with elections next week and the handover of power in iraq at the end of the month .
so , what did the prime minister tell us ?
fuel prices need to be kept under review , a lot depends on the world fuel prices .
we have to take the cia chief resignation at face value , it has nothing to do with 9/11 or iraq .
iraq has been difficult , we know 2 things , that saddam had wmd , and that we have yet to find them .
i had to balance whether we leave saddam in power or take him out , we saw 300,000 mass graves in iraq .
if we look at the 7 years of labour : we have a strong economy , unemployment is no longer a headline issue , schools are improving .
but there is still work to be done .
when we talk about my agenda : international vs. domestic , my diary is more taken up with domestic issues , such as crime and disorder .
regarding the smoking ban , it really is only at discussion stage , it is something which will probably have to be considered locally. click here for q & a : 10 june elections we would like to hear from you : what do you think of tony blair ?
is he doing a good job ?
will he be winning your support ?

from september , school children in hong kong will also have the opportunity to read about the killings of 15 years ago .
four pages on the tiananmen protests are to be included in a new textbook , following a decision to add them to the territory 's new chinese history syllabus .
wong chi-man admits to caution over his portrayal of the protests the teacher who wrote the section , wong chi-man , admitted he had taken a cautious approach .
" i 've stuck to the facts , " he said .
" i 've just tried my best to write what needed to be written . "
the language is neutral .
the text describes how the square was " cleared " at the end of the protest .
there is no description of the tanks that were used against the protestors , or of the bloodbath that followed .
mr wong said he had to leave out such details to ensure that the editors of the textbook did not reject his chapter .
he said he thought it was more important to ensure the event was included in the textbook at all .
" it is very important in chinese history , " he said .
" these were students who lost their lives because they fought for freedom and democracy .
it is worthy to commemorate this event and let the -lsb- hong kong school -rsb- students learn from history . "
the organisers of events in hong kong to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre said they were expecting record numbers of people to take part this year .
they claimed that , at least in part , this was due to recent political events in the territory .
1989 tiananmen events 15 april - reformist leader hu yaobang dies 22 april - hu 's memorial service , thousands call for faster reforms 13 may - students begin hunger strike as power struggle grips communist party 15 may - soviet leader mikhail gorbachev visits china 19 may - zhao ziyang makes tearful appeal to students to leave 20 may - martial law declared in beijing 3-4 june - security forces clear the square , killing hundreds background to tiananmen a few weeks ago beijing 's parliament , the national people 's congress , ruled that universal suffrage would not be introduced in hong kong in time to elect the territory 's leader in 2007 .
the announcement was followed by the resignation of three controversial radio hosts , who complained they were subjected to threats and intimidation by " pro-beijing forces " .
none of the three have produced any hard evidence to back up their claims , but there are increasing fears that free speech is under threat in the former british colony , in the run-up to the elections for hong kong 's mini-parliament in september .
" recently there are many signs that they want to reduce free speech here , " said the roman catholic bishop of hong kong joseph zen .
" we must wake up and defend this freedom , which is very fundamental , because without this freedom hong kong would be hopeless , " he said .
the outspoken primate said he backed protests to press for more democracy , both in hong kong and china .
he described himself as " optimistic " that the chinese leadership would eventually change its position on the protests in beijing 15 years ago .
" you can talk more openly about tiananmen square these days , " he said .
" i hope a reversal of their position wo n't be so far away . "
' dirty tricks ' allegations pro-china politicians in hong kong like ma lik , the chairman of the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong , find themselves forced to defend their allies in beijing against allegations they are running a dirty tricks campaign in the territory .
" i do n't think the central government officials are that dirty to try to fight the people , or to try to stop them criticising the government , " he said .
" it would backfire on them . "
ma lik is concerned that pro-democracy politicians in hong kong are using the row over the alleged threats to radio hosts to try to drum up anti-beijing sentiment .
" they will tell voters , if you want to send a message to beijing , do n't vote for my party , " he complained .
" we will be squeezed , making it easier for them to win more seats in the legislative council . "
but hong kong lawmaker lee cheuk yan rejected that idea .
he was involved in the struggle in beijing 15 years ago , and was detained after attempting to deliver funds collected in hong kong to the students in tiananmen square .
now he is at the forefront of efforts to commemorate the events of 4 june 1989 , and to try to force the authorities to introduce what he calls " full democracy " in hong kong .
" in the past we felt we had to push to try to achieve democracy in china , " he said .
" now we feel we have to defend hong kong against the regressive hand of beijing . "
" fifteen years after tiananmen square , we are now feeling the same pressure from beijing that the students felt .
we have to use what freedoms we have to defend ourselves . "

1989 tiananmen events 15 april - reformist leader hu yaobang dies 22 april - hu 's memorial service , thousands call for faster reforms 13 may - students begin hunger strike as power struggle grips communist party 15 may - soviet leader mikhail gorbachev visits china 19 may - zhao ziyang makes tearful appeal to students to leave 20 may - martial law declared in beijing 3-4 june - security forces clear the square , killing hundreds background to tiananmen a few weeks ago beijing 's parliament , the national people 's congress , ruled that universal suffrage would not be introduced in hong kong in time to elect the territory 's leader in 2007 .
the announcement was followed by the resignation of three controversial radio hosts , who complained they were subjected to threats and intimidation by " pro-beijing forces " .
none of the three have produced any hard evidence to back up their claims , but there are increasing fears that free speech is under threat in the former british colony , in the run-up to the elections for hong kong 's mini-parliament in september .
" recently there are many signs that they want to reduce free speech here , " said the roman catholic bishop of hong kong joseph zen .
" we must wake up and defend this freedom , which is very fundamental , because without this freedom hong kong would be hopeless , " he said .
the outspoken primate said he backed protests to press for more democracy , both in hong kong and china .
he described himself as " optimistic " that the chinese leadership would eventually change its position on the protests in beijing 15 years ago .
" you can talk more openly about tiananmen square these days , " he said .
" i hope a reversal of their position wo n't be so far away . "
' dirty tricks ' allegations pro-china politicians in hong kong like ma lik , the chairman of the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong , find themselves forced to defend their allies in beijing against allegations they are running a dirty tricks campaign in the territory .
" i do n't think the central government officials are that dirty to try to fight the people , or to try to stop them criticising the government , " he said .
" it would backfire on them . "
ma lik is concerned that pro-democracy politicians in hong kong are using the row over the alleged threats to radio hosts to try to drum up anti-beijing sentiment .
" they will tell voters , if you want to send a message to beijing , do n't vote for my party , " he complained .
" we will be squeezed , making it easier for them to win more seats in the legislative council . "
but hong kong lawmaker lee cheuk yan rejected that idea .
he was involved in the struggle in beijing 15 years ago , and was detained after attempting to deliver funds collected in hong kong to the students in tiananmen square .
now he is at the forefront of efforts to commemorate the events of 4 june 1989 , and to try to force the authorities to introduce what he calls " full democracy " in hong kong .
" in the past we felt we had to push to try to achieve democracy in china , " he said .
" now we feel we have to defend hong kong against the regressive hand of beijing . "
" fifteen years after tiananmen square , we are now feeling the same pressure from beijing that the students felt .
we have to use what freedoms we have to defend ourselves . "

four pages on the tiananmen protests are to be included in a new textbook , following a decision to add them to the territory 's new chinese history syllabus .
wong chi-man admits to caution over his portrayal of the protests the teacher who wrote the section , wong chi-man , admitted he had taken a cautious approach .
" i 've stuck to the facts , " he said .
" i 've just tried my best to write what needed to be written . "
the language is neutral .
the text describes how the square was " cleared " at the end of the protest .
there is no description of the tanks that were used against the protestors , or of the bloodbath that followed .
mr wong said he had to leave out such details to ensure that the editors of the textbook did not reject his chapter .
he said he thought it was more important to ensure the event was included in the textbook at all .
" it is very important in chinese history , " he said .
" these were students who lost their lives because they fought for freedom and democracy .
it is worthy to commemorate this event and let the -lsb- hong kong school -rsb- students learn from history . "
the organisers of events in hong kong to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre said they were expecting record numbers of people to take part this year .
they claimed that , at least in part , this was due to recent political events in the territory .
1989 tiananmen events 15 april - reformist leader hu yaobang dies 22 april - hu 's memorial service , thousands call for faster reforms 13 may - students begin hunger strike as power struggle grips communist party 15 may - soviet leader mikhail gorbachev visits china 19 may - zhao ziyang makes tearful appeal to students to leave 20 may - martial law declared in beijing 3-4 june - security forces clear the square , killing hundreds background to tiananmen a few weeks ago beijing 's parliament , the national people 's congress , ruled that universal suffrage would not be introduced in hong kong in time to elect the territory 's leader in 2007 .
the announcement was followed by the resignation of three controversial radio hosts , who complained they were subjected to threats and intimidation by " pro-beijing forces " .
none of the three have produced any hard evidence to back up their claims , but there are increasing fears that free speech is under threat in the former british colony , in the run-up to the elections for hong kong 's mini-parliament in september .
" recently there are many signs that they want to reduce free speech here , " said the roman catholic bishop of hong kong joseph zen .
" we must wake up and defend this freedom , which is very fundamental , because without this freedom hong kong would be hopeless , " he said .
the outspoken primate said he backed protests to press for more democracy , both in hong kong and china .
he described himself as " optimistic " that the chinese leadership would eventually change its position on the protests in beijing 15 years ago .
" you can talk more openly about tiananmen square these days , " he said .
" i hope a reversal of their position wo n't be so far away . "
' dirty tricks ' allegations pro-china politicians in hong kong like ma lik , the chairman of the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong , find themselves forced to defend their allies in beijing against allegations they are running a dirty tricks campaign in the territory .
" i do n't think the central government officials are that dirty to try to fight the people , or to try to stop them criticising the government , " he said .
" it would backfire on them . "
ma lik is concerned that pro-democracy politicians in hong kong are using the row over the alleged threats to radio hosts to try to drum up anti-beijing sentiment .
" they will tell voters , if you want to send a message to beijing , do n't vote for my party , " he complained .
" we will be squeezed , making it easier for them to win more seats in the legislative council . "
but hong kong lawmaker lee cheuk yan rejected that idea .
he was involved in the struggle in beijing 15 years ago , and was detained after attempting to deliver funds collected in hong kong to the students in tiananmen square .
now he is at the forefront of efforts to commemorate the events of 4 june 1989 , and to try to force the authorities to introduce what he calls " full democracy " in hong kong .
" in the past we felt we had to push to try to achieve democracy in china , " he said .
" now we feel we have to defend hong kong against the regressive hand of beijing . "
" fifteen years after tiananmen square , we are now feeling the same pressure from beijing that the students felt .
we have to use what freedoms we have to defend ourselves . "

but it also emphasises the contrast with the relative poverty of the scottish premier league -lrb- spl -rrb- .
with the average premiership club now generating revenue of more than £ 65m , only rangers and celtic come close .
in england , premiership clubs have made operating profits of £ 124m , while the last available figures for the spl 's members indicate losses of £ 60m .
the research by the sports business group at deloitte has emphasised the scale of the challenge facing most scottish clubs if they try to attract players of international standing . "
clubs like aberdeen or hibernian would be like a mid-tier division one club in england " alan switzer deloitte deloitte consultant alan switzer said : " obviously you 've got two clubs that dominate - celtic and rangers last year had turnover figures of £ 60m and £ 49m .
" they would be like an average premiership club or just below .
" for the other scottish premier league clubs , you would n't compare them to the premiership .
" clubs like aberdeen or hibernian would be like a mid-tier division one club in england . "
english club football has not only generated more cash than scottish football , it has taken steps to match costs to income .
the deloitte research showed wages in england growing at the lowest rate since the formation of the premiership .
deloitte partner dan jones said : " lower wage growth , combined with a much reduced level of transfer spending , provides evidence of stronger financial management and helps the premiership maintain its position as the ' financial champions of the world ' . "
financial realism as the spl clubs struggle to bring their costs under control , they remain buried under a mountain of debt .
previous research by pricewaterhousecoopers -lrb- pwc -rrb- calculated their combined debts at £ 144m .
pwc 's assessment in the autumn of 2003 was that five spl clubs - dundee , dunfermline , hearts , hibs and livingston - were technically insolvent .
but alan switzer at deloitte said he detected a new sense of realism in scottish football .
he said : " i 'm sure they realise that they ca n't compete with some of the top premiership clubs and they 'll have to adjust their cost base accordingly . "
much of the english success is built on a large fan base .
in 2002/2003 , average match attendance in the premiership topped 35,000 for the first time since 1951 .
but the largest single source of income is from broadcasting , with domestic television rights generating £ 404m last year .
one of the few crumbs of comfort for the scottish premier league is that similar countries are experiencing serious problems in financing their senior football teams .
mr switzer said : " we have looked at other small european countries , at the football leagues in countries such as the netherlands and portugal .
" those leagues were losing money , just like the scottish premier league . "
