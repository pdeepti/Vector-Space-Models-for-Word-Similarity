program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.03.2004 unfaithfully yours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the germans polled in the survey want to spice up their sex lives a little .
on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !
ever been in need of the ultimate alibi ?
a german software company might just have the perfect solution : it offers background noises that can be played during cell phone conversations .
-lrb- march 12 , 2004 -rrb- your alibi , just a click away ever gone out with the ex one night only to have the current love ask where you were ?
several german web sites have the perfect alibi for you , at a price .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 swedish minister 's killer gets life sentence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confessed killer mijailovic faces around 15 years in jail .
swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .
11 .
the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of poland and germany found common ground .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .

german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region . in an interview with german tabloid bild am sonntag , struck described the situation as extremely unstable and warned both sides not to attack kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- troops .
" they should know that nato and the german military will defend themselves with all possible means , " struck said .
" nato will win this conflict with its military might . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck -lrb- left -rrb- struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said he did n't expect nato troops to leave the province by the original departure date of 2006 .
" we 'll have to stay much longer , " he said .
" we 'd planned to withdraw bit by bit , but that 's not going to happen now . " germany 's military , the bundeswehr , began sending additional soldiers to kosovo on saturday .
altogether , 600 troops will be added , bringing the german presence to 3,800 soldiers . no violence at funeral ceremony while tensions in the province had eased on saturday after several days of fighting , there were fears that violence would return in connection with the burial of two albanian boys on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a serbian house on fire south of mitrovica on saturday .
serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .
the boy 's deaths sparked the recent clashes between serbs and albanians during which at least 28 people were killed , 600 were wounded and thousands were displaced from their homes , according to un officials . two of the boys were be buried on sunday , the third has not been found so far .
about 8,000 albanians attended the funeral ceremony in the town of cabra .
it took place under tight security , with hundreds of soldiers from germany , denmark and pakistan as well as italian police officers on guard .
an unmanned surveillance plane , three helicopters and german snipers also observed the area . meanwhile officials in montenegro , which forms a union with serbia , said they were willing to serve as mediators between serbs and albanians in the conflict .
ranko krivokapic , the president of montenegro 's parliament , said on sunday he planned to make the offer at a kosovo conference on friday in lucerne , switzerland .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .
11 .
the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .
31 but it wo n't do much to dam the flood .
-lrb- october 10 , 2003 -rrb- fighting a losing battle against spam as spam mail transforms personal computers into rubbish dumps , a german internet organization has published an online " anti spam white paper " to inform users how to combat the nuisance .
but zapping spam is far from easy .
-lrb- march 16 , 2003 -rrb- feedback will it only be the people who send out spam at the sharp end of germany 's new laws or will legitimate businesses suffer ?

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of poland and germany found common ground .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .

" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .
a " double majority " compromise now on the table would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts - tipping the scales slightly in favor of smaller member states . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 one-click justice comes to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " stolen : one sleigh , nine reindeer , one with a red nose , big bag of presents " a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes . anyone who has been the victim of a traffic accident , verbal or physical abuse will know that such stressful and upsetting events are often made worse by the paperwork that has to be filled out afterwards .
that is , if you want the matter to be resolved through legal channels . a traumatic visit to the police station may be followed by endlessly looking through pictures , giving statements , answering repetitive questions and making possibly humiliating court appearances .
but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .
but on the other hand , he sees that the system could be open to abuse .
planke has a simple solution : " why does n't the government just increase the number of police staff ?

" they should know that nato and the german military will defend themselves with all possible means , " struck said .

" we 'll have to stay much longer , " he said .
" we 'd planned to withdraw bit by bit , but that 's not going to happen now . " germany 's military , the bundeswehr , began sending additional soldiers to kosovo on saturday .

serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .
the boy 's deaths sparked the recent clashes between serbs and albanians during which at least 28 people were killed , 600 were wounded and thousands were displaced from their homes , according to un officials . two of the boys were be buried on sunday , the third has not been found so far .
about 8,000 albanians attended the funeral ceremony in the town of cabra .

reinhardt added that little had been done to improve the situation in kosovo since the war in 1999 .
without a political solution to the problem , the province 's economy could not be privatized , keeping away outside investors that could create jobs .
this lack of a political solution would lead to frustration , which would turn into violence , reinhardt said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 swedish minister 's killer gets life sentence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confessed killer mijailovic faces around 15 years in jail .
swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .
11 .
the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 one-click justice comes to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " stolen : one sleigh , nine reindeer , one with a red nose , big bag of presents " a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes . anyone who has been the victim of a traffic accident , verbal or physical abuse will know that such stressful and upsetting events are often made worse by the paperwork that has to be filled out afterwards .
that is , if you want the matter to be resolved through legal channels . a traumatic visit to the police station may be followed by endlessly looking through pictures , giving statements , answering repetitive questions and making possibly humiliating court appearances .
but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .
but on the other hand , he sees that the system could be open to abuse .
planke has a simple solution : " why does n't the government just increase the number of police staff ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .
31 but it wo n't do much to dam the flood .
-lrb- october 10 , 2003 -rrb- fighting a losing battle against spam as spam mail transforms personal computers into rubbish dumps , a german internet organization has published an online " anti spam white paper " to inform users how to combat the nuisance .
but zapping spam is far from easy .
-lrb- march 16 , 2003 -rrb- feedback will it only be the people who send out spam at the sharp end of germany 's new laws or will legitimate businesses suffer ?

serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .
the boy 's deaths sparked the recent clashes between serbs and albanians during which at least 28 people were killed , 600 were wounded and thousands were displaced from their homes , according to un officials . two of the boys were be buried on sunday , the third has not been found so far .

" political solution needed commenting on the situation in kosovo on german public radio deutschlandfunk , the former head of kfor said he believed increasing the military presence in kosovo would not solve the problem .
" you ca n't solve social conflict with the military , you have to do away with the causes , " klaus reinhardt said . " something happens and what do they do ?
they send in more soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren on friday .
reinhardt added that little had been done to improve the situation in kosovo since the war in 1999 .
without a political solution to the problem , the province 's economy could not be privatized , keeping away outside investors that could create jobs .
this lack of a political solution would lead to frustration , which would turn into violence , reinhardt said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .

under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of poland and germany found common ground .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 one-click justice comes to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " stolen : one sleigh , nine reindeer , one with a red nose , big bag of presents " a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes . anyone who has been the victim of a traffic accident , verbal or physical abuse will know that such stressful and upsetting events are often made worse by the paperwork that has to be filled out afterwards .
that is , if you want the matter to be resolved through legal channels . a traumatic visit to the police station may be followed by endlessly looking through pictures , giving statements , answering repetitive questions and making possibly humiliating court appearances .
but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .
but on the other hand , he sees that the system could be open to abuse .
planke has a simple solution : " why does n't the government just increase the number of police staff ?

serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .
31 but it wo n't do much to dam the flood .
-lrb- october 10 , 2003 -rrb- fighting a losing battle against spam as spam mail transforms personal computers into rubbish dumps , a german internet organization has published an online " anti spam white paper " to inform users how to combat the nuisance .
but zapping spam is far from easy .
-lrb- march 16 , 2003 -rrb- feedback will it only be the people who send out spam at the sharp end of germany 's new laws or will legitimate businesses suffer ?

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .

" we 'll have to stay much longer , " he said .
" we 'd planned to withdraw bit by bit , but that 's not going to happen now . " germany 's military , the bundeswehr , began sending additional soldiers to kosovo on saturday .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .

german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region . in an interview with german tabloid bild am sonntag , struck described the situation as extremely unstable and warned both sides not to attack kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- troops .
" they should know that nato and the german military will defend themselves with all possible means , " struck said .
" nato will win this conflict with its military might . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck -lrb- left -rrb- struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said he did n't expect nato troops to leave the province by the original departure date of 2006 .
" we 'll have to stay much longer , " he said .
" we 'd planned to withdraw bit by bit , but that 's not going to happen now . " germany 's military , the bundeswehr , began sending additional soldiers to kosovo on saturday .
altogether , 600 troops will be added , bringing the german presence to 3,800 soldiers . no violence at funeral ceremony while tensions in the province had eased on saturday after several days of fighting , there were fears that violence would return in connection with the burial of two albanian boys on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a serbian house on fire south of mitrovica on saturday .
serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .
the boy 's deaths sparked the recent clashes between serbs and albanians during which at least 28 people were killed , 600 were wounded and thousands were displaced from their homes , according to un officials . two of the boys were be buried on sunday , the third has not been found so far .
about 8,000 albanians attended the funeral ceremony in the town of cabra .
it took place under tight security , with hundreds of soldiers from germany , denmark and pakistan as well as italian police officers on guard .
an unmanned surveillance plane , three helicopters and german snipers also observed the area . meanwhile officials in montenegro , which forms a union with serbia , said they were willing to serve as mediators between serbs and albanians in the conflict .
ranko krivokapic , the president of montenegro 's parliament , said on sunday he planned to make the offer at a kosovo conference on friday in lucerne , switzerland .
he added that he believed montenegro could better help along negotiations as the conflict in kosovo was a " conflict of two nationalisms . " political solution needed commenting on the situation in kosovo on german public radio deutschlandfunk , the former head of kfor said he believed increasing the military presence in kosovo would not solve the problem .
" you ca n't solve social conflict with the military , you have to do away with the causes , " klaus reinhardt said . " something happens and what do they do ?
they send in more soldiers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren on friday .
reinhardt added that little had been done to improve the situation in kosovo since the war in 1999 .
without a political solution to the problem , the province 's economy could not be privatized , keeping away outside investors that could create jobs .
this lack of a political solution would lead to frustration , which would turn into violence , reinhardt said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .

but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .
but on the other hand , he sees that the system could be open to abuse .
planke has a simple solution : " why does n't the government just increase the number of police staff ?

" they should know that nato and the german military will defend themselves with all possible means , " struck said .

" we 'll have to stay much longer , " he said .
" we 'd planned to withdraw bit by bit , but that 's not going to happen now . " germany 's military , the bundeswehr , began sending additional soldiers to kosovo on saturday .

serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .
the boy 's deaths sparked the recent clashes between serbs and albanians during which at least 28 people were killed , 600 were wounded and thousands were displaced from their homes , according to un officials . two of the boys were be buried on sunday , the third has not been found so far .
about 8,000 albanians attended the funeral ceremony in the town of cabra .
it took place under tight security , with hundreds of soldiers from germany , denmark and pakistan as well as italian police officers on guard .
an unmanned surveillance plane , three helicopters and german snipers also observed the area . meanwhile officials in montenegro , which forms a union with serbia , said they were willing to serve as mediators between serbs and albanians in the conflict .
ranko krivokapic , the president of montenegro 's parliament , said on sunday he planned to make the offer at a kosovo conference on friday in lucerne , switzerland .

reinhardt added that little had been done to improve the situation in kosovo since the war in 1999 .
without a political solution to the problem , the province 's economy could not be privatized , keeping away outside investors that could create jobs .
this lack of a political solution would lead to frustration , which would turn into violence , reinhardt said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .

but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .
but on the other hand , he sees that the system could be open to abuse .
planke has a simple solution : " why does n't the government just increase the number of police staff ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 swedish minister 's killer gets life sentence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confessed killer mijailovic faces around 15 years in jail .
swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .
11 .
the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .

with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .

row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .

" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany prepares laws to battle spam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam is clogging up cyberspace and people 's inboxes .
germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .
authorized commercial mail under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the united states is so extreme that even commercial e-mail that a consumer might have consented to receive - such as online bills - is sometimes blocked , either by consumers themselves or by internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- acting on their behalf .
" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .
it is a balance the german government is going to want to get right : saving money that is spent dealing with junk mail and making sure businesses that rely on an internet presence for their sales do n't suffer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de most eu states fail to combat spam nine eu member states have failed to adopt on time a privacy law helping the fight against unwanted e-mail , or so-called spam .
-lrb- march 8 , 2003 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .
31 but it wo n't do much to dam the flood .
-lrb- october 10 , 2003 -rrb- fighting a losing battle against spam as spam mail transforms personal computers into rubbish dumps , a german internet organization has published an online " anti spam white paper " to inform users how to combat the nuisance .
but zapping spam is far from easy .
-lrb- march 16 , 2003 -rrb- feedback will it only be the people who send out spam at the sharp end of germany 's new laws or will legitimate businesses suffer ?

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .

the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

that is , if you want the matter to be resolved through legal channels . a traumatic visit to the police station may be followed by endlessly looking through pictures , giving statements , answering repetitive questions and making possibly humiliating court appearances .
but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .
the case must still be taken on and investigated , " he said in an interview with the der spiegel newsmagazine . wendt actually sees the service resulting in more wasted time .
" -lrb- in nrw -rrb- , more than 80 percent of the reports end up in the waste-paper basket . "
with people finding it easier to report crime without the stigma of visiting a police station , wendt believes that number could rise dramatically and that the service is just another government fad .
" the government lurches from one modernization project to the other , " he lamented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet service follows hot on the heels of an sms phone initiative that has members of the public sending phone messages to police whenever they see a crime or criminal . herbert planke , gdp police trade chairman , agrees .
on the one hand , he accepts that the police 's main task is to ensure people 's security and he welcomes new ways to do so .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

serbs had allegedly thrown three boys in the river ibar in the town of mitrovica on tuesday , causing them to drown .

about 8,000 albanians attended the funeral ceremony in the town of cabra .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 swedish minister 's killer gets life sentence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confessed killer mijailovic faces around 15 years in jail .
swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .
11 .
the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .
in a country where politicians cultivate the impression that they are normal citizens , even lindh 's death has only caused very few of them to accept having bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .

the popular foreign minister , who was tipped as sweden 's next prime minister , died the day after the attack .
mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .
the country continues to dwell on the unresolved assassination of prime minister olof palme outside a stockholm movie theater in 1986 .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .
a " double majority " compromise now on the table would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts - tipping the scales slightly in favor of smaller member states . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .

germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . germany 's social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- government announced on monday that it plans to introduce an " anti spam " law in an attempt to stem the tide of unsolicited junk e-mails that is costing the country millions of euros . the law will be germany 's first attempt at introducing a successful and effective punishment for those unscrupulous companies who bombard inboxes with undesirable advertising mails .
the laws that the spd intend to bring in at the start of april will consist of punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment for the worst offenders . germany was one of the countries criticized last year by the european commission for not implementing spam restrictions in accordance with an eu directive .
along with belgium , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden , germany failed to adopt the privacy law which would have helped in the eu 's fight against unwanted e-mail . " we urge member states to adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited e-mails , the use of location data or cookies , " said erkki liikanen , eu commissioner for enterprise and the information society in december . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector , " he added . spam makes up over half of eu 's email bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the end of last year , a european union taskforce on spam estimated that over 50 percent of all e-mail sent in the eu was unwanted advertising .
experts calculated that the annual cost for european firms attempting to prevent and extinguish undesirable messages was around € 2.5 billion .
the german move to block spam follows a similar introduction of legislation that was pushed through in the united states at the end of 2003 .
the first federal law regulating spam , called the can-spam act , took effect on january 1 , 2004 .
instead of banning unwanted e-mail , can-spam instead laid down a complex set of rules - such as honoring unsubscribe requests - that spammers must follow .
germany looking towards u.s. model ?
under can-spam , the u.s. justice department and federal prosecutors around the country can file criminal charges against those spammers who commit crimes such as misleading consumers and using false information when buying a domain or signing up for a web mail account .
the fines which can be handed down under the u.s. law can be as heavy as $ 1 million as well as prison sentences for as much as five years .
however , if germany is looking towards the u.s. model as a lead in the fight against spam then it should also consider its limitations .
experts who have been monitoring the effects of can-spam claim that the sanctions are unlikely to stop the flow of bulk solicitations that are flooding into email in-boxes . how effective are criminal laws ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : criminal laws " have n't done much to deter virus writers and hackers , " said anthony teelucksingh , an attorney in the u.s. justice department 's computer crime and intellectual property section to reporters at a workshop organized by the national institute of standards and technology .
" i do n't think that criminal prosecutions , even that many of them , will put that big a dent " in spam , he said .
don blumenthal , an attorney at the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- and director of its internet lab , echoed teelucksingh 's cautionary tone .
" can-spam is not going to solve the problem , " he said and concluded , " spam 's going to rule our world in the near future . "
danger to legitimate businesses germany should be aware that companies who make a living from legitimate online businesses are suffering under the new laws in the united states .
" the cost of reaching consumers is going up , while response is down , " said jerry cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs at the u.s. direct marketing association -lrb- dma -rrb- in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
under the law , companies have to clearly label their messages as a commercial , can not use false or misleading head and subject lines , and are forbidden from harvesting e-mail addresses from online sources .
they must also offer users clear opt-out mechanisms , provide them with a physical contact address and maintain lists of users who do n't want to be contacted via e-mail .

" we 've got to figure out spam or else e-mail -lrb- marketing -rrb- is going to die , " said cerasale .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2004 one-click justice comes to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " stolen : one sleigh , nine reindeer , one with a red nose , big bag of presents " a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes . anyone who has been the victim of a traffic accident , verbal or physical abuse will know that such stressful and upsetting events are often made worse by the paperwork that has to be filled out afterwards .
that is , if you want the matter to be resolved through legal channels . a traumatic visit to the police station may be followed by endlessly looking through pictures , giving statements , answering repetitive questions and making possibly humiliating court appearances .
but all this could be a thing of the past thanks to the latest in germany 's e-government reform . after a successful test phase in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , members of the public will soon be able to make official statements on everything from barking dogs to reckless drivers by accessing a specially prepared internet site . announced by nrw interior minister fritz behrens at the cebit technology fair in hanover on monday , the " click and complain " service is the embodiment of the federal government 's electronic push into the new century , albeit a few years behind a lot of other countries . site offers forms on various crimes harnessing the spirit of e-government , the service intends to simplify and accelerate the process between citizen and state when it comes to reporting offenses through the easy-to-complete pre-formulated questionnaires on the homepage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once logged on , a citizen seeking to bring wrong-doers to justice can scan through the prepared forms on the list .
offenses listed at the launch of the service include : " theft and deception " ; " physical injury and insult , " " criminal offenses in traffic , " " criminal offenses in connection with the internet " and the catch-all " other criminal offenses and incidents . "
there really is something for everyone . a click on the offense of choice and one arrives at a friendly web questionnaire which can be filled in and sent out in no time at all .
to report a " criminal offense in traffic , " the socially-minded citizen would fill in his or her name and address , tell when and where the incident took place , describe the culprit 's vehicle and then describe the alleged perpetrator and detail the alleged perpetrator 's crime . reports are legally binding the process is simple enough for a passenger to complete by laptop and mobile phone while riding away from the scene of the crime .
the information , which is treated as legally effective once submitted , is then handled by the authorities .
the developers of the new service have yet to find a way of saving the police even more man hours by arresting and convicting the perpetrator without the need of officers . " this procedure is not only very comfortable and quick for the citizens .
the police also get to know about a lot more criminal offenses , " said behrens in hanover .
surveys that took place alongside the trial showed that every third incident would not have been reported to the police without the help of the internet . however , the police themselves are not as enamored with the idea as the politicians seem to be .
while police officers numbers continue to be cut , those who remain have had to work longer hours .
a shortfall in new recruits has caused the police in nrw to complain that the force lacked almost 5,000 officers in 2003 .
this year , only 500 new recruits will join the force , although 1,000 had been expected . online access open to abuse with police numbers falling , the idea of online complaints and paperwork completed by members of the public should free up cops who still have jobs to do what they 're paid to do - catch criminals .
but rainer wendt , chairman of the police trade union dpoig in nrw , is skeptical .
" online reports do not necessarily mean less work for the police .
once the report is sent , the cozy world of online reports ends .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh 's assassin was sentenced to life in prison tuesday .
confessed murderer mijailo mijailovic will also have to pay € 16,270 in damages to lindh 's husband and two children . mijailovic claimed voices in his head told him to kill anna lindh , who he knived 10 times in a stockholm department store in september .
the defense had argued that the 25-year-old was psychologically disturbed and should have been charged with manslaughter .
but psychiatric tests determined mijailovic had been sane when he attacked lindh . " the deed which mijailo mijailovic is guilty of warrants a very severe penalty , " a written statement released by the stockholm court said .
" as no mitigating circumstances have come to light , he is therefore sentenced to life in prison . " a life sentence in sweden usually means 15 years in jail . the court also ordered mijailovic to pay 50,000 swedish crowns -lrb- around € 5,420 or $ 6,650 -rrb- in damages each to lindh 's husband bo holmberg and their two sons . mentally accountable mijailovic 's lawyer , peter althin , has three weeks to contest the court 's decision .
althin had asked for a reassessment of the tests that verified mijailovic 's mental health , which the court rejected .
mijailovic had received psychiatric counseling in the past and had sought help shortly before the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portraits of anna lindh were placed in front of government buildings and the department stores where she was killed in stockholm where mourners could place flowers and light candles after her death on sept .

mijailovic , 25 , was arrested two weeks later . the son of serbian immigrants initially denied the accusations against him but finally confessed to killing lindh in january .
by then investigators were in possession of incriminating evidence , including dna samples , that implicated mijailovic .
motives remain unclear even now that the trial has come to an end mijailovic 's motives remain in the dark .
public prosecutor agneta blidberg suggested that mijailovic was driven by hate of strong , independent , successful women in her final speech to the court .
mijailovic has denied he killed lindh for political reasons .
" i 'm not interested in politics , " he told prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against lindh . "
at the time of the attack , lindh 's face was plastered all over stockholm on posters urging swedes to vote to join the european common currency , the euro , which failed in a referendum three days after the politician died . lindh 's death was the second assassination of a politician in sweden in the modern era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc chirac and ahern hope for june finish on constitution hopes that a deal on the draft eu constitution can be reached within the first half of this year were given a further boost following a meeting monday , march 22 , between france and the irish eu presidency .
at a joint press conference afterwards , french president jacques chirac and irish prime minister bertie ahern gave their clearest indication to date that a deal may be in sight .
chirac , who until now has been publicly reticent on the constitution blueprint , said he was " determined " to do everything so that an agreement can be found at a meeting of eu leaders on june 17-18 .
" today we think that it is possible to reach an agreement by this date , " he said .
chirac 's comments follow in the footsteps of important u-turns by madrid and warsaw towards a compromise on a proposed new voting system , a contentious issue that caused constitution talks to collapse in december .
the revised compromise voting system would call for support by 55 % of member states representing 55 % of the eu population in order for a decision to pass .
such a structure would mean that a combination of germany , france and britain - the eu 's biggest countries - could not block a decision without the backing of other member states .
influence of terror attacks ?
there have been signs that the recent terror attacks in madrid may have refocussed political will for adopting an eu constitution .
speaking at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday , france 's dominique de villepin said that following madrid bombings it was time for the eu to affirm its " vision . "
similarly , his german counterpart joschka fischer said that the challenges involved with fighting terrorism needed " an effective , democratic and strong europe . "
he added that this could only be achieved with a constitution .
all depends on the dinner date all these signs have been interpreted positively by the irish eu presidency which has been quietly but determinedly working towards an agreement .
prime minister ahern was quoted in the irish independent saying , " i think it is possible that we can conclude the work of the convention by the june council . "
however , the decision to formally revive the talks on the constitution will depend on what eu leaders decide over dinner on thursday evening during a summit in brussels .
ahern will circulate a summary document on wednesday outlining the status quo and is set to give a more frank overview on thursday .
afterwards a decision will be made .

at a joint press conference afterwards , french president jacques chirac and irish prime minister bertie ahern gave their clearest indication to date that a deal may be in sight .
chirac , who until now has been publicly reticent on the constitution blueprint , said he was " determined " to do everything so that an agreement can be found at a meeting of eu leaders on june 17-18 .
" today we think that it is possible to reach an agreement by this date , " he said .
chirac 's comments follow in the footsteps of important u-turns by madrid and warsaw towards a compromise on a proposed new voting system , a contentious issue that caused constitution talks to collapse in december .
the revised compromise voting system would call for support by 55 % of member states representing 55 % of the eu population in order for a decision to pass .
such a structure would mean that a combination of germany , france and britain - the eu 's biggest countries - could not block a decision without the backing of other member states .
influence of terror attacks ?
there have been signs that the recent terror attacks in madrid may have refocussed political will for adopting an eu constitution .
speaking at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday , france 's dominique de villepin said that following madrid bombings it was time for the eu to affirm its " vision . "
similarly , his german counterpart joschka fischer said that the challenges involved with fighting terrorism needed " an effective , democratic and strong europe . "
he added that this could only be achieved with a constitution .
all depends on the dinner date all these signs have been interpreted positively by the irish eu presidency which has been quietly but determinedly working towards an agreement .
prime minister ahern was quoted in the irish independent saying , " i think it is possible that we can conclude the work of the convention by the june council . "
however , the decision to formally revive the talks on the constitution will depend on what eu leaders decide over dinner on thursday evening during a summit in brussels .
ahern will circulate a summary document on wednesday outlining the status quo and is set to give a more frank overview on thursday .
afterwards a decision will be made .
" it is up to them to decide ' well do we resurrect this thing together , or do we let it fall ' , " said a diplomat close to the irish presidency . dw-world.de germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution german chancellor schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution on tuesday during a meeting in warsaw , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june .

at a joint press conference afterwards , french president jacques chirac and irish prime minister bertie ahern gave their clearest indication to date that a deal may be in sight .
chirac , who until now has been publicly reticent on the constitution blueprint , said he was " determined " to do everything so that an agreement can be found at a meeting of eu leaders on june 17-18 .
" today we think that it is possible to reach an agreement by this date , " he said .
chirac 's comments follow in the footsteps of important u-turns by madrid and warsaw towards a compromise on a proposed new voting system , a contentious issue that caused constitution talks to collapse in december .
the revised compromise voting system would call for support by 55 % of member states representing 55 % of the eu population in order for a decision to pass .
such a structure would mean that a combination of germany , france and britain - the eu 's biggest countries - could not block a decision without the backing of other member states .
influence of terror attacks ?
there have been signs that the recent terror attacks in madrid may have refocussed political will for adopting an eu constitution .
speaking at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday , france 's dominique de villepin said that following madrid bombings it was time for the eu to affirm its " vision . "
similarly , his german counterpart joschka fischer said that the challenges involved with fighting terrorism needed " an effective , democratic and strong europe . "
he added that this could only be achieved with a constitution .
all depends on the dinner date all these signs have been interpreted positively by the irish eu presidency which has been quietly but determinedly working towards an agreement .
prime minister ahern was quoted in the irish independent saying , " i think it is possible that we can conclude the work of the convention by the june council . "
however , the decision to formally revive the talks on the constitution will depend on what eu leaders decide over dinner on thursday evening during a summit in brussels .
ahern will circulate a summary document on wednesday outlining the status quo and is set to give a more frank overview on thursday .
afterwards a decision will be made .
" it is up to them to decide ' well do we resurrect this thing together , or do we let it fall ' , " said a diplomat close to the irish presidency . dw-world.de germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution german chancellor schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution on tuesday during a meeting in warsaw , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of poland and germany found common ground .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .
a " double majority " compromise now on the table would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts - tipping the scales slightly in favor of smaller member states . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved .

on the surface , most germans would seem to enjoy an average and relatively healthy love life but under the covers , it ’ s a hot bed of infidelity and irresponsible sexual activity , according to a recent study . while the economy flounders , unemployment rises and the political system seems wrought with problems , at least germans can take heart from their loving and stable personal lives in the midst of such turmoil .
on average , germans have sex 120 times a year , meaning that they put aside their troubles and get some good lovin ' almost every third day .
however , the façade of togetherness has been blown apart by a recent study by condom manufacturer durex which reveals that every third german has cheated on his or her partner at least once and an equal number are dissatisfied with their love life .
in search of greener grass in the study that polled more than 10,000 germans , 36 percent of women admitted to having played away from home on occasion while , 30 percent of men confessed to making hanky-panky with someone other than their significant other .
the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

the study also showed that as germans get older , the chances that they will stray from the fold increases .
by the age of 35 every second german has had sex outside of their relationship .
the durex survey also showed that germans wanted more from their sex lives .
almost 45 percent said that they wanted to have more spontaneous sex while 43 longed to be more experimental .
going through the motions also seemed to annoy the germans with 38 percent wishing their partners would put a bit more imagination into their performance .
perhaps unsurprisingly , 37 percent of the men said the answer to their problems would be just more sex .
unprotected sex however , infidelity and routine is - so to speak - just the tip of the iceberg .
the durex study also highlights a dangerous practice amongst german adults where one in five had unprotected sex with a new partner last year in spite of the continuing menace of hiv / aids and other sexually transferable illnesses .
a worrying 19 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men admitted to unprotected sex with someone whose sexual history they knew nothing about , while in the most carefree age group of 21-to 24 year-old , every fourth person said they 'd not taken precautions with a new partner . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honey , i can barely hear you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2004 germany , poland reach breakthrough on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of poland and germany found common ground .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .
a " double majority " compromise now on the table would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts - tipping the scales slightly in favor of smaller member states . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart leszek miller broke an impasse over the eu constitution during a meeting in warsaw on tuesday , saying that a deal could be reached by the end of june . eu constitution talks , which have been mired in deadlock for the past three months over country voting rights , might finally be regaining momentum .
on tuesday , schröder and miller indicated that they were willing bury their differences on the draft text and work together to hammer out a deal .
" i am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution , which is already in full swing , should be finished during the irish presidency -lrb- in the first half of 2004 -rrb- , " schröder told a joint news conference after a lunch with miller at the polish prime minister 's home .
miller , whose country is the largest among ten new mainly former communist countries poised to join the eu on may 1 , played a key role in blocking a deal on the charter last december .
but with schröder he signaled that warsaw had climbed down from its earlier entrenched stance .
" in our talks with the chancellor , we discussed various ways of reaching a compromise … we believe that a compromise is not only necessary but also possible , " miller said .
row laid to rest the breakthrough on tuesday brings to an end a simmering dispute on the constitution that pitted poland and spain against germany and france over the controversial issue of voting rights .
germany and france , supported by most eu members , backed laws that would require the support of at least 50 percent of eu member states representing at least 60 percent of the bloc 's population . but spain and poland objected that the proposed constitution would curb their countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 which benefited medium-sized countries .
poland follows spanish example but , in recent weeks , poland had feared becoming isolated on the issue and signaled an easing of its once entrenched stance .
the change followed a reverse of policy from the new incoming socialist government in spain , which has pledged to work towards reaching a quick compromise on the stalled constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller last week miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told journalists in brussels he did not want his country left alone after spain 's change of tack on the eu constitution and polish president alexander kwasniewski too asserted that there was now room for compromise for a constitution deal .
this week , the poles stepped up their conciliatory tone .
" i see some ground for optimism because at least some of the concepts being unofficially suggested or consulted seem to be a good basis for compromise , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said at an eu foreign minister summit on monday .
poland to move away from nice warsaw 's new change of heart had raised hopes that a deal on the constitution may now be within reach and schröder 's visit was expected to sound out the chances for success . speaking on tuesday , schröder said he welcomed the fact that " poland is really ready to take responsibility for the expansion of the bloc " and added that one of the corner stones of the constitution was to lay the groundwork for decision-making in the expanded union .
with its present change of stance , warsaw has also indicated it 's ready to move away from its insistence on sticking to the nice agreement and consider the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency .
a " double majority " compromise now on the table would change the balance of power to 55 percent on both counts - tipping the scales slightly in favor of smaller member states . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved .

the house of commons ' public account committee said many people paid about £ 18 per year for a handset when they could buy a similar model for £ 7 .
the report said consumers could be missing out on millions of pounds of savings because the telecoms market is too " confusing " .
it called on regulator oftel to encourage consumers to switch deals .
bt was privatised in 1984 , but it still has 75 % of the uk domestic market .
key findings the market is confusing for consumers consumers may not have the right information to identify the best deal consumers may be confused about what they are paying at present many consumers are not taking advantage of existing opportunities to save money oftel was remote from consumers and did not do enough to help them ofcom should actively encourage consumers to switch supplier ofcom should conduct a research exercise into the information needs of consumers many telephone bills do not provide enough information to allow customers to determine the best tariff and discount options , the pac report said .
the differing ways in which companies quote phone tariffs also meant that comparisons could be difficult .
the committee criticised the " tiny slice " spent by regulators on publicity and accused oftel of being " remote " .
it called on the office of communications -lrb- ofcom -rrb- , which took over regulation in december 2003 , to provide guidance on how consumers can identify the best supplier , using a series of typical phone bills as case studies .
the report identifies a number of ways in which people could make savings .
of particular concern to the committee was the uptake of the bt light user scheme , which gives discounts of up to 50 % on line rental charges to people who rarely use their phones .
around 3.5 million customers - some of them poor - could be missing out on savings , it said .
' save money ' and customers on bt 's standard tariff , who make international calls , could halve the cost if they used another company to make overseas calls .
committee chairman edward leigh mp said : " many consumers are not getting as good a deal as they could on their telephone bills .
they could save money by either switching supplier or changing their tariff .
" it is unacceptable that bt retains around 70 % of the total market 20 years after privatisation .
" there is no doubt that consumers find the telecommunications market confusing , and need more help to make properly informed choices . "
a bt spokesman said it was right to shop around and the company provided competitive deals .

the house of commons ' public account committee said many people paid about £ 18 per year for a handset when they could buy a similar model for £ 7 .
the report said consumers could be missing out on millions of pounds of savings because the telecoms market is too " confusing " .
it called on regulator oftel to encourage consumers to switch deals .
bt was privatised in 1984 , but it still has 75 % of the uk domestic market .
key findings the market is confusing for consumers consumers may not have the right information to identify the best deal consumers may be confused about what they are paying at present many consumers are not taking advantage of existing opportunities to save money oftel was remote from consumers and did not do enough to help them ofcom should actively encourage consumers to switch supplier ofcom should conduct a research exercise into the information needs of consumers many telephone bills do not provide enough information to allow customers to determine the best tariff and discount options , the pac report said .
the differing ways in which companies quote phone tariffs also meant that comparisons could be difficult .
the committee criticised the " tiny slice " spent by regulators on publicity and accused oftel of being " remote " .
it called on the office of communications -lrb- ofcom -rrb- , which took over regulation in december 2003 , to provide guidance on how consumers can identify the best supplier , using a series of typical phone bills as case studies .
the report identifies a number of ways in which people could make savings .
of particular concern to the committee was the uptake of the bt light user scheme , which gives discounts of up to 50 % on line rental charges to people who rarely use their phones .
around 3.5 million customers - some of them poor - could be missing out on savings , it said .
' save money ' and customers on bt 's standard tariff , who make international calls , could halve the cost if they used another company to make overseas calls .
committee chairman edward leigh mp said : " many consumers are not getting as good a deal as they could on their telephone bills .
they could save money by either switching supplier or changing their tariff .
" it is unacceptable that bt retains around 70 % of the total market 20 years after privatisation .
" there is no doubt that consumers find the telecommunications market confusing , and need more help to make properly informed choices . "
a bt spokesman said it was right to shop around and the company provided competitive deals .

the top-selling suffolk cookery writer has been dubbed the country 's favourite because of the amount her books appear to be used in kitchens .
a survey for bbc good food magazine asked readers to count how many splashes and thumbprints marked their cookbooks as a key test of popularity .
the responses proved delia 's were the most stained .
readers were asked to select their five most used cookery books , estimate how many recipes they had made more than once from each , and to count the number of pages marked by stains and smears while the recipe was being followed .
they were also asked to nominate the book they would keep if they were allowed only one .
delia - who is donating her own stained copy of the complete cookery course to the british library for their archive - said : " i 'm delighted to hear my books are so well used .
' battered copies ' " i love it at signings when people pull out their old battered copies , often with the covers hanging off .

" that 's one reason why i have launched the delia collection - so i can find my own favourites more easily . "
the survey , returned by 141 readers , revealed the director of norwich city football club is way ahead of the competition from other celebrity cooks , including naked chef jamie oliver and domestic goddess nigella lawson .
in the category of most used , 18 % were by delia , readers between them staining 355 pages of her most popular book delia smith 's cookery course .

it 's the scenario played out in this week 's drama documentary if ... the generations fall out .
will the young rebel against paying to support an ageing population ?
far-fetched ?
not so , says laurence kotlikoff , professor of economics at boston university , who thinks that unless the baby boomers pay up , parents and children could soon be at war .
whether we want to accept it or not , the entire developed world is getting old , indeed , very old .
over the next three decades the numbers of oldsters in the eu , japan , and the us will more than double , while the number of workers expected to pay the elderly their state pension and health care benefits will rise by less than 10 % .
the developed world is not just getting old .
it 's going to get old and then get even older .
in 2100 , the elderly share of developed world populations will be higher than in any year in this century .
the magnitude of the prospective ageing is hard to wrap one 's head around .
in 2030 , the population of the united states will be older than in present-day florida , a haven for retirees .
imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 two decades later , the number of old-old americans , those 85 and older , will suffice to fill up new york , los angeles , chicago , and several other major us cities .
and the number of american centenarians in 2050 will suffice to populate washington dc .
imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 .
fiscal strain if this sounds old , note that america will be the young kid on the block .
both europe and japan will be significantly older than the united states .
this demographic phenomenon is unprecedented in human history .
it will generate enormous social , political , economic , and fiscal strains , the prospects of which are being largely ignored by our political leaders .
when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give with respect to fiscal strains , we need to realise that right here and right now the developed world is bankrupt ; there is no possibility of raising taxes high enough to cover all the pension and health care benefits promised to current and future retirees .
and trying to drop the entire bill into our children 's laps is n't any solution .
it 's not only immoral , it 's also infeasible .
doing so would entail more than doubling their lifetime rates of taxation .
unstoppable force radically and immediately restructuring and cutting benefit programs is essential , but , it seems , politically unacceptable .
but when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give .
what will give in this case is the printing press .
governments throughout the developed world will resort to printing money to " pay " what they owe .
the result will be extended periods of very high inflation , if not hyperinflation , during which governments renege on what they owe by paying their bills with waterdown currency .
there are meaningful , if very painful , policy reforms that can still save the day .
in the film , the young protest under the slogan : we pay , they play but they have to be undertaken immediately .
these reforms include asking the current rich and middle class elderly to help pay off existing government pension liabilities and then setting up a rational , efficient , inexpensive , and highly diversified system of individual compulsory saving accounts .

far-fetched ?
not so , says laurence kotlikoff , professor of economics at boston university , who thinks that unless the baby boomers pay up , parents and children could soon be at war .
whether we want to accept it or not , the entire developed world is getting old , indeed , very old .
over the next three decades the numbers of oldsters in the eu , japan , and the us will more than double , while the number of workers expected to pay the elderly their state pension and health care benefits will rise by less than 10 % .
the developed world is not just getting old .
it 's going to get old and then get even older .
in 2100 , the elderly share of developed world populations will be higher than in any year in this century .
the magnitude of the prospective ageing is hard to wrap one 's head around .
in 2030 , the population of the united states will be older than in present-day florida , a haven for retirees .
imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 two decades later , the number of old-old americans , those 85 and older , will suffice to fill up new york , los angeles , chicago , and several other major us cities .
and the number of american centenarians in 2050 will suffice to populate washington dc .
imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 .
fiscal strain if this sounds old , note that america will be the young kid on the block .
both europe and japan will be significantly older than the united states .
this demographic phenomenon is unprecedented in human history .
it will generate enormous social , political , economic , and fiscal strains , the prospects of which are being largely ignored by our political leaders .
when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give with respect to fiscal strains , we need to realise that right here and right now the developed world is bankrupt ; there is no possibility of raising taxes high enough to cover all the pension and health care benefits promised to current and future retirees .
and trying to drop the entire bill into our children 's laps is n't any solution .
it 's not only immoral , it 's also infeasible .
doing so would entail more than doubling their lifetime rates of taxation .
unstoppable force radically and immediately restructuring and cutting benefit programs is essential , but , it seems , politically unacceptable .
but when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give .
what will give in this case is the printing press .
governments throughout the developed world will resort to printing money to " pay " what they owe .
the result will be extended periods of very high inflation , if not hyperinflation , during which governments renege on what they owe by paying their bills with waterdown currency .
there are meaningful , if very painful , policy reforms that can still save the day .
in the film , the young protest under the slogan : we pay , they play but they have to be undertaken immediately .
these reforms include asking the current rich and middle class elderly to help pay off existing government pension liabilities and then setting up a rational , efficient , inexpensive , and highly diversified system of individual compulsory saving accounts .
another key reform is providing government health care to the elderly through a voucher system in which individual vouchers are determined based on the elderly recipient 's current health status and the overall expenditure on vouchers is capped at what the country can afford .

imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 " two decades later , the number of old-old americans , those 85 and older , will suffice to fill up new york , los angeles , chicago , and several other major us cities .
and the number of american centenarians in 2050 will suffice to populate washington dc .
imagine visiting washington dc and not meeting anyone younger than 100 .
fiscal strain if this sounds old , note that america will be the young kid on the block .
both europe and japan will be significantly older than the united states .
this demographic phenomenon is unprecedented in human history .
it will generate enormous social , political , economic , and fiscal strains , the prospects of which are being largely ignored by our political leaders . "
when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give " with respect to fiscal strains , we need to realise that right here and right now the developed world is bankrupt ; there is no possibility of raising taxes high enough to cover all the pension and health care benefits promised to current and future retirees .
and trying to drop the entire bill into our children 's laps is n't any solution .
it 's not only immoral , it 's also infeasible .
doing so would entail more than doubling their lifetime rates of taxation .
unstoppable force radically and immediately restructuring and cutting benefit programs is essential , but , it seems , politically unacceptable .
but when an unstoppable force meets an immovable barrier , something has to give .
what will give in this case is the printing press .
governments throughout the developed world will resort to printing money to " pay " what they owe .
the result will be extended periods of very high inflation , if not hyperinflation , during which governments renege on what they owe by paying their bills with waterdown currency .
there are meaningful , if very painful , policy reforms that can still save the day .
but they have to be undertaken immediately .
these reforms include asking the current rich and middle class elderly to help pay off existing government pension liabilities and then setting up a rational , efficient , inexpensive , and highly diversified system of individual compulsory saving accounts .
another key reform is providing government health care to the elderly through a voucher system in which individual vouchers are determined based on the elderly recipient 's current health status and the overall expenditure on vouchers is capped at what the country can afford .
another argentina ?
another key reform is to switch from economically meaningless deficit accounting to generational accounting - a new method of long-term fiscal planning that focuses on the fiscal burden to be handed to young and future generations .
these and other reforms could keep the developed world from becoming another argentina , but their acceptance by the public will require a degree of maturity and concern for the next generation that goes far beyond anything we 've seen to date .
this grim assessment suggests that we each need to look out for ourselves and plan for a much rougher retirement ride than we had expected .
this entails saving much more , thinking about how to avoid future taxes , looking out for high future rates of inflation , and realising that when the fiscal system implodes , the economy will do likewise .
professor kotlikoff has written a book on the issue called : the coming generational storm : what you need to know about america 's economic future .
he also took part in the bbc programme if ... the generations fall out which was broadcast in the uk on bbc two on wednesday , 24 march , 2004 .

the original flower growers were badly advised .
when ugandan farmers started to grow roses back in 1992 , they were told to grow large ones , just as kenyan farmers did .
but it did not work , essentially because of the different climates in the two countries .
risky the cooler night temperatures and higher altitudes of kenya 's highlands were ideal for large roses .
not so in uganda where they failed to grow as big .
" we were inexperienced , we were extremely ignorant about what we went into , " said stanley mulumba , who was fortunate enough to cling on to his farm through the crisis .
" it was a very risky venture , we were almost sold in 1999 , we almost went under receivership , " he said .
mr mulumba , a retired architect , recalls how banks panicked as rose growers struggled with high interest rates , price fluctuations and inexperience .
many farms went bankrupt and were sold .
revival but then mr mulumba and other farmers discovered that the ugandan climate was better suited for another breed of rose .
smaller sweetheart roses thrived in uganda .
and these roses could be grown in much larger quantities .
soon new owners stepped in to benefit from economies of scale , and the banks returned to offer their backing .
" confidence in flowers began to revive , " mr mulumba said .
at mr mulumba 's farm , ugarose , you can see a further two rose farms on the edge of lake victoria , and altogether there are five farms nearby .
" banks right now are looking for flower growers to lend money to , " mr mulumba said .
" flowers are the only sector where the banks have a lot of confidence in terms of large scale lending . "
lower costs some flower growers in uganda have built large businesses .
one is pim de witte who left holland to work on a ugandan flower farm in 1995 .
the farm he was working on soon went bankrupt , so he moved on , setting up business with his father and others in 1998 .
" the first people that started made basic mistakes , " mr de witte said .
but with industry experience gained at his father 's flower farm in holland , growth was rapid .
the farm now employs 900 people and mr de witt is in no doubt the move to uganda was a wise one .
" floriculture is labour intensive , labour is expensive -lrb- in holland -rrb- , " he reasoned .
" here , weather conditions are more favourable , you do n't need to heat your greenhouses and production costs per unit are cheaper . "
competition there are now about 20 flower growing farms , covering some 170 hectares , in uganda , said valentine ogwang , assistant director of the uganda investment authority .
most are at the edge of lake victoria , and this enables the growers to access both water and the airport for overnight delivery to europe .
this year , uganda is expected to earn about $ 30m from the export of flowers .
but uganda is still a tiny player compared with kenya , which has 500 hectares , and colombia and israel , which have thousands of hectares .
and with ethiopia starting to grow flowers and kenya planning to expand , local rose growers can not afford to relax .
big roses get cheap as kenya and other growers continue to expand , the price of larger roses is expected to fall , keith henderson , executive director , of uganda flower exporters association -lrb- ufea -rrb- , said .
uganda 's exporters want to see the country 's industry double within 15 months , growing slightly bigger roses .
their size , or quality , will never match that of kenya 's , but the hope is that their greater quantity should ensure that they have equally high returns .
and if demand from the european market ever falters , mr ogwang wants to see a day when ugandans are big flower buyers .
mr ogwang is keen to educate ugandans about what to do with flowers .
" it is a new product , " he said .
" what flower do you have for a funeral ?
this is an area where there is a big gap . "

beijing broke off contacts as the us prepared to condemn its human rights record at a united nations meeting .
the american ambassador in beijing was summoned to be told that china " can not but immediately halt bilateral human rights dialogue and exchanges " .
the us action was " serious interference in china 's internal affairs , " said a foreign ministry statement .
' backsliding ' the bush administration announced on monday that it would seek a resolution condemning china for alleged abuses at the un commission on human rights currently meeting in geneva .
state department spokesman richard boucher said that despite a promise of improvements made at the end of 2002 , china 's record last year actually got worse .
" we are concerned about backsliding on key human rights issues that has occurred in a variety of areas since that time , " mr boucher said .
areas of concern included extrajudicial killings , torture , repression of religious and political groups , and arrests of internet dissidents and hiv / aids activists .
however , mr boucher insisted that in other areas relations with china were the best they have been for decades .
spotlight china 's assistant foreign minister , shen guofang , accused the us of " double standards " .
" the united states ' insistence on provoking confrontation has seriously damaged the foundation of our two countries ' human rights dialogue and exchange , " he was quoted as saying .
washington decided not to seek a resolution criticising china at last year 's un meeting because of what it called limited but significant progress .
such a resolution has been introduced almost every year since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at tiananmen square .
condemnation by the 53-member commission in geneva incurs no penalties , but puts the spotlight on a country 's rights record .

beijing broke off contacts as the us prepared to condemn its human rights record at a united nations meeting .
the american ambassador in beijing was summoned to be told that china " can not but immediately halt bilateral human rights dialogue and exchanges " .
the us action was " serious interference in china 's internal affairs , " said a foreign ministry statement .
' backsliding ' the bush administration announced on monday that it would seek a resolution condemning china for alleged abuses at the un commission on human rights currently meeting in geneva .
state department spokesman richard boucher said that despite a promise of improvements made at the end of 2002 , china 's record last year actually got worse .
" we are concerned about backsliding on key human rights issues that has occurred in a variety of areas since that time , " mr boucher said .
areas of concern included extrajudicial killings , torture , repression of religious and political groups , and arrests of internet dissidents and hiv / aids activists .
however , mr boucher insisted that in other areas relations with china were the best they have been for decades .
spotlight china 's assistant foreign minister , shen guofang , accused the us of " double standards " .
" the united states ' insistence on provoking confrontation has seriously damaged the foundation of our two countries ' human rights dialogue and exchange , " he was quoted as saying .
washington decided not to seek a resolution criticising china at last year 's un meeting because of what it called limited but significant progress .
such a resolution has been introduced almost every year since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at tiananmen square .
condemnation by the 53-member commission in geneva incurs no penalties , but puts the spotlight on a country 's rights record .
the us move came as eu ministers prepared to consider lifting an arms embargo placed upon china in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square killings .
the us , which has its own embargo in place , is opposed to the eu relaxing its measures .

a wto panel has said that the us has failed to prove that imports of canadian softwood lumber threaten to harm its own industry .
canada has long called for the us to remove its import tariffs , but the us has insisted they remain .
america accuses its northern neighbour of unfairly subsidising production .
canada strongly denies this .
loggerheads the dispute has been a long running sore between the two nations , who both have extensive timber industries .
the decision of the wto 's panel could now lead to it insisting that the two year old us tariffs be removed .
however , the matter is rather more complicated , and there are a number of other aspects that remain unresolved .
the wto report said that the decision of the us international trade commission to impose tariffs " is not one which could have been reached by an objective and unbiased investigating authority " .
canada said it now expected the us to remove the tariffs .
' vigorously enforce ' " this -lrb- the wto judgement -rrb- means that the countervailing and anti-dumping duties are unjustified , and canada expects the us to bring its measures in line with wto obligations , " said a spokeswoman for the canadian trade ministry .
" today 's ruling goes quite a way to affirming that our exports do not injure the us industry , " carl grenier , executive vice president of canada 's free trade lumber council , told the bbc 's world business report .
mr grenier added that the effect of the us tariffs on canada 's timber industry had been " terrible . "
however , it is less than likely that the us will grant canada 's wishes at this stage .
richard mills , a spokesman for the office of us trade representative said the wto ruling " in no way affects the ability of the united states to continue to vigorously enforce trade remedy laws . "

scientists at birmingham university and st george 's hospital , london , found breast tissue contains an enzyme that activates vitamin d. levels of the enzyme were elevated in breast tumours - suggesting the vitamin is produced to try to combat the spread of cancer .
the research was presented at a meeting of the british endocrine societies .
perhaps now it 's time to look at improving our dietary intake through fortification of more foods with vitamin d. dr martin hewison previously it was thought that the active form of vitamin d - calcitriol , which is a potent anti-cancer agent , was only made in the kidney .
the researchers think having a local cancer-fighting ' factory ' is part of the breast 's natural immune response to a tumour .
and they suggest that the rise in breast cancer rates in the uk may be linked to the fact that we have low levels of vitamin d in our bodies .
exposure to sunlight is the greatest source of vitamin d and population studies have previously suggested higher vitamin levels may contribute to the lower incidence of breast cancer seen in sunny climates such as the mediterranean .
diet possibilities lead researcher dr martin hewison said : " our work shows that the breast has its own local ' factory ' for generating the anti-cancer form of vitamin d.
" unfortunately women who live in cloudy countries like the uk may not have enough of the raw material , vitamin d , to fuel this factory .
" exposure to sunlight is the most efficient way of generating vitamin d in our bodies , but we all know of the dangers of sunbathing .
" perhaps now it 's time to look at improving our dietary intake through fortification of more foods with vitamin d. "
delyth morgan , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said previous research had also suggested that vitamin d may help prevent and treat some cancers , including breast cancer .
however , she said the effect had yet to be confirmed in human trials .
" further research is needed before any firm conclusions about the role of vitamin d in breast cancer prevention can be established . "
vitamin d is generated by exposing the skin to sunlight .
it is also found in dairy products , fish oils and breakfast cereals .
however , too much vitamin d is thought to disrupt the body 's phosphate and calcium levels .
the uk food standards agency recommends a daily allowance of 5 micrograms .

scientists at birmingham university and st george 's hospital , london , found breast tissue contains an enzyme that activates vitamin d. levels of the enzyme were elevated in breast tumours - suggesting the vitamin is produced to try to combat the spread of cancer .
the research was presented at a meeting of the british endocrine societies .
perhaps now it 's time to look at improving our dietary intake through fortification of more foods with vitamin d. dr martin hewison previously it was thought that the active form of vitamin d - calcitriol , which is a potent anti-cancer agent , was only made in the kidney .
the researchers think having a local cancer-fighting ' factory ' is part of the breast 's natural immune response to a tumour .
and they suggest that the rise in breast cancer rates in the uk may be linked to the fact that we have low levels of vitamin d in our bodies .
exposure to sunlight is the greatest source of vitamin d and population studies have previously suggested higher vitamin levels may contribute to the lower incidence of breast cancer seen in sunny climates such as the mediterranean .
diet possibilities lead researcher dr martin hewison said : " our work shows that the breast has its own local ' factory ' for generating the anti-cancer form of vitamin d.
" unfortunately women who live in cloudy countries like the uk may not have enough of the raw material , vitamin d , to fuel this factory .
" exposure to sunlight is the most efficient way of generating vitamin d in our bodies , but we all know of the dangers of sunbathing .
" perhaps now it 's time to look at improving our dietary intake through fortification of more foods with vitamin d. "
delyth morgan , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said previous research had also suggested that vitamin d may help prevent and treat some cancers , including breast cancer .
however , she said the effect had yet to be confirmed in human trials .
" further research is needed before any firm conclusions about the role of vitamin d in breast cancer prevention can be established . "
vitamin d is generated by exposing the skin to sunlight .
it is also found in dairy products , fish oils and breakfast cereals .
however , too much vitamin d is thought to disrupt the body 's phosphate and calcium levels .
the uk food standards agency recommends a daily allowance of 5 micrograms .

the study of sociology , anthropology and philosophy will end , while the centre for development studies will end undergraduate teaching to concentrate on post graduate study and research .
a decision on the future of the chemistry department has been deferred .
the decision was made by the university 's council on monday , with staff in the affected departments expected to receive formal notification of the decision on tuesday .
swansea 's vice chancellor professor richard davies has previously said that the changes are being made in response to the demands of students . "
this has been an issue which has brought students together like nothing has for years " student hannah quinn in recent years courses in media studies , translation and egyptology have experienced increased popularity at the expense of more traditional academic disciplines .
but the plans have proved unpopular among many students and staff at the university .
hannah quinn , the student union 's welfare and education officer , told bbc wales : " this has been an issue which has brought students together like nothing has for years .
" we are not seeing students and their quality of education as the priority .
" the priority is to make money . "
she added : " we are working with the welsh assembly and we are calling for clear and transparent consultation .
" students and staff fell alienated from this process . "
colwin williamson , of the association of university teachers , added that staff and students had united over the issue .
he said : " today , i 'm starting to feel a lot more positive about it .
" there are all sorts of things that we can do and the struggle will continue .
" the most heartening thing is the way it has united staff and students against these dreadful plans .
" -lrb- the plans represent -rrb- the further decline of education brought in by the market . "
since the plan was backed in principle by the university 's ruling council in january there have been petitions and demonstrations at the campus .
the association of university teachers -lrb- aut -rrb- has even called for the resignation of council members .
it is claimed some of the subjects under threat are popular with mature students and ending them would mean they would not return to study .
there is also anger over the way the restructuring was announced and claims staff and students have not been fully consulted .
academics from other universities and colleges have sent letters and e-mails backing the protest .
but professor davies said consultation had been going on since october .
he said under the plan teaching for subjects including history , english , geography and computing would be expanded with 75 new posts created over the next three years .
" the benefits to students are the highest quality , up-to-date , career-enhancing courses , " said professor davies .
" all universities have from time to time to adjust their courses to changing patterns of student demand . "

the study of sociology , anthropology and philosophy will end , while the centre for development studies will end undergraduate teaching to concentrate on post graduate study and research .
a decision on the future of the chemistry department has been deferred .
the decision was made by the university 's council on monday .
swansea 's vice chancellor professor richard davies has previously said that the changes are being made in response to the demands of students .
this has been an issue which has brought students together like nothing has for years student hannah quinn in recent years courses in media studies , translation and egyptology have experienced increased popularity at the expense of more traditional academic disciplines .
but the plans have proved unpopular among many students and staff at the university .
hannah quinn , the student union 's welfare and education officer , told bbc wales : " this has been an issue which has brought students together like nothing has for years .
" we are not seeing students and their quality of education as the priority .
" the priority is to make money . "
she added : " we are working with the welsh assembly and we are calling for clear and transparent consultation .
" students and staff fell alienated from this process . "
colwin williamson , of the association of university teachers , added that staff and students had united over the issue .
consultations have been on-going at the university since the autumn he said : " today , i 'm starting to feel a lot more positive about it .
" there are all sorts of things that we can do and the struggle will continue .
" the most heartening thing is the way it has united staff and students against these dreadful plans .
" -lrb- the plans represent -rrb- the further decline of education brought in by the market . "
since the plan was backed in principle by the university 's ruling council in january there have been petitions and demonstrations at the campus .
the association of university teachers -lrb- aut -rrb- has even called for the resignation of council members .
it is claimed some of the subjects under threat are popular with mature students and ending them would mean they would not return to study .
there is also anger over the way the restructuring was announced and claims staff and students have not been fully consulted .
academics from other universities and colleges have sent letters and e-mails backing the protest .
but professor davies said consultation had been going on since october .
he said under the plan teaching for subjects including history , english , geography and computing would be expanded with 75 new posts created over the next three years .
" the benefits to students are the highest quality , up-to-date , career-enhancing courses , " said professor davies .
" all universities have from time to time to adjust their courses to changing patterns of student demand . "
staff in the affected departments are expected to receive formal notification of the decision on tuesday .

patricia amos , of banbury , oxfordshire , is due to be sentenced on tuesday for letting her daughter jacqueline , 14 , miss class almost every other day .
amos , 45 , was found guilty by bicester magistrates in february .
she was previously jailed for 60 days in 2002 after failing to stop her other child , emma , then 15 , from truanting .
written warnings at the february hearing , amos argued she made " every effort " to get jacqueline to school .
but the prosecution said that despite repeated phone calls , home visits and written warnings , amos had failed to give explanations for many of her daughter 's absences .
the court heard the 14-year-old missed 31 out of 80 days at banbury school between may and october 2003 .
jacqueline told the court most of the time she had missed school had been without her mother 's knowledge , but this was rejected by magistrates .
her older daughter , emma , went on to win a top english prize after returning to lessons last year .
she has now left school and attends a further education college .

patricia amos , of banbury , oxfordshire , is due to be sentenced on tuesday for letting her daughter jacqueline , 14 , miss class almost every other day .
amos , 45 , was found guilty by bicester magistrates in february .
she was previously jailed for 60 days in 2002 after failing to stop her other child , emma , then 15 , from truanting .
written warnings at the february hearing , amos argued she made " every effort " to get jacqueline to school .
but the prosecution said that despite repeated phone calls , home visits and written warnings , amos had failed to give explanations for many of her daughter 's absences .
the court heard the 14-year-old missed 31 out of 80 days at banbury school between may and october 2003 .
jacqueline told the court most of the time she had missed school had been without her mother 's knowledge , but this was rejected by magistrates .
her older daughter , emma , went on to win a top english prize after returning to lessons last year .
she has now left school and attends a further education college .

patricia amos , of banbury , oxfordshire , is due to be sentenced on tuesday for letting her daughter jacqueline , 14 , miss class almost every other day .
amos , 45 , was found guilty by bicester magistrates in february .
she was previously jailed for 60 days in 2002 after failing to stop her other child , emma , then 15 , from truanting .
written warnings at the february hearing , amos argued she made " every effort " to get jacqueline to school .
but the prosecution said that despite repeated phone calls , home visits and written warnings , amos had failed to give explanations for many of her daughter 's absences .
the court heard the 14-year-old missed 31 out of 80 days at banbury school between may and october 2003 .
jacqueline told the court most of the time she had missed school had been without her mother 's knowledge , but this was rejected by magistrates .
her older daughter , emma , went on to win a top english prize after returning to lessons last year .
she has now left school and attends a further education college .
