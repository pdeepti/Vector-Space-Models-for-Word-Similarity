shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .
until that happens , guided tours of weissenhof take place once a week in winter and twice a week in summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart : no grit , just green can visitors have fun in " the city where work is a pleasure ? "

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2004 chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akhmed kadyrov 's death clouds the future of chechnya .
the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

valery baranov , left , speak just 5 minutes before an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital where they were attending victory day observances , grozny , sunday , may 9 , 2004 .
kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
in the meantime , prime minister sergei abramov - another pro-kremlin figure , will act as president . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 10.05.2004 model homes from the modernist movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le corbusier house on the weissenhof site some of the greatest masters of modern architecture are behind the weissenhof settlement in stuttgart .
originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .
until that happens , guided tours of weissenhof take place once a week in winter and twice a week in summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart : no grit , just green can visitors have fun in " the city where work is a pleasure ? "

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .

kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .
until that happens , guided tours of weissenhof take place once a week in winter and twice a week in summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart : no grit , just green can visitors have fun in " the city where work is a pleasure ? "

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2004 a supermarket for the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this store can even beat aldi 's prices .
shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .
" we certainly have no lack of people who are needy , " he said . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

reports in the british press say blair will use the launch of the labour party ’ s campaign for the european elections in june to firm up his negotiating position .
the threat of a ‘ no ’ vote and the ensuing crisis it would provoke has strengthened blair ’ s hand .
according to the guardian , finance minister gordon brown will use tuesday 's meeting with his eu counterparts to ask for at least 25 amendments to the draft treaty in the areas of taxation and budget .
tax had been one of the uk government ’ s so-called " red lines " – no-go areas for the eu ’ s powers to expand into .
other red lines include the abolition of the veto over defense , foreign policy and social security .
france last year , during the french election campaign , president jacques chirac pledged to hold a referendum on the constitution .
this promise has now come home to roost with chirac , who is being called upon to hold the vote .
both the french and british public are largely unaware of the detail of the text and many in both countries are skeptical of the document .
blair now appears to be ready to use this euro-skepticism to retain influence next month when foreign ministers meet to discuss the draft text .
the irish government , which holds the rotating eu presidency , will chair the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2004 blair : government only recently learned of uk abuses in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu ghraib prison : uk and u.s. soldiers are purported to have abused iraqi prisoners here allegations that uk troops tortured iraqi prisoners are rocking britain .
prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc blair to reaffirm eu constitution " red lines " after calling for a referendum on the eu constitution , prime minister tony blair will toughen his government ’ s stance on the document ahead of final talks next month .
reports in the british press say blair will use the launch of the labour party ’ s campaign for the european elections in june to firm up his negotiating position .
the threat of a ‘ no ’ vote and the ensuing crisis it would provoke has strengthened blair ’ s hand .
according to the guardian , finance minister gordon brown will use tuesday 's meeting with his eu counterparts to ask for at least 25 amendments to the draft treaty in the areas of taxation and budget .
tax had been one of the uk government ’ s so-called " red lines " – no-go areas for the eu ’ s powers to expand into .
other red lines include the abolition of the veto over defense , foreign policy and social security .
france last year , during the french election campaign , president jacques chirac pledged to hold a referendum on the constitution .
this promise has now come home to roost with chirac , who is being called upon to hold the vote .
both the french and british public are largely unaware of the detail of the text and many in both countries are skeptical of the document .
blair now appears to be ready to use this euro-skepticism to retain influence next month when foreign ministers meet to discuss the draft text .
the irish government , which holds the rotating eu presidency , will chair the talks .

reports in the british press say blair will use the launch of the labour party ’ s campaign for the european elections in june to firm up his negotiating position .
the threat of a ‘ no ’ vote and the ensuing crisis it would provoke has strengthened blair ’ s hand .
according to the guardian , finance minister gordon brown will use tuesday 's meeting with his eu counterparts to ask for at least 25 amendments to the draft treaty in the areas of taxation and budget .
tax had been one of the uk government ’ s so-called " red lines " – no-go areas for the eu ’ s powers to expand into .
other red lines include the abolition of the veto over defense , foreign policy and social security .
france last year , during the french election campaign , president jacques chirac pledged to hold a referendum on the constitution .
this promise has now come home to roost with chirac , who is being called upon to hold the vote .
both the french and british public are largely unaware of the detail of the text and many in both countries are skeptical of the document .
blair now appears to be ready to use this euro-skepticism to retain influence next month when foreign ministers meet to discuss the draft text .
the irish government , which holds the rotating eu presidency , will chair the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2004 blair : government only recently learned of uk abuses in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu ghraib prison : uk and u.s. soldiers are purported to have abused iraqi prisoners here allegations that uk troops tortured iraqi prisoners are rocking britain .
prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "

in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .

several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .

that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .

" nothing was fixed about going to see british war graves , and nothing was cancelled .

labor agency board member heinrich alt reportedly told a parliamentary committee that merging unemployment and welfare benefits as is planned would require 24,200 additional workers .
but a spokesman for the labor agency told the dpa news agency the figure was only " theoretical " in nature and would only occur if local authorities , which used to be responsible for welfare recipients , did not offer any personnel to take some of the workload .
the german labor ministry has said most of the estimated 40,000 benefit caseworkers ' positions would be filled by moving existing employees instead of hiring new people . more briefs 10.05.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank reportedly pursuing takeover of postbank 07.05.2004 -pipe- firms face fines for ignoring trainees 07.05.2004 -pipe- judge refuses new evidence in mannessmann trial 07.05.2004 -pipe- adidas prepares to launch bionic running shoe 07.05.2004 -pipe- german government launches apprenticeship initiative 06.05.2004 -pipe- porn emails cost employees their jobs 06.05.2004 -pipe- plunging tax revenues give berlin budget headache 06.05.2004 -pipe- german industrial orders drop in march radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

valery baranov , left , speak just 5 minutes before an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital where they were attending victory day observances , grozny , sunday , may 9 , 2004 .
kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
in the meantime , prime minister sergei abramov - another pro-kremlin figure , will act as president . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .
until that happens , guided tours of weissenhof take place once a week in winter and twice a week in summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart : no grit , just green can visitors have fun in " the city where work is a pleasure ? "
the answer is yes - especially if they like cars .

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

valery baranov , left , speak just 5 minutes before an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital where they were attending victory day observances , grozny , sunday , may 9 , 2004 .
kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
in the meantime , prime minister sergei abramov - another pro-kremlin figure , will act as president . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2004 a supermarket for the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this store can even beat aldi 's prices .
shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2004 chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akhmed kadyrov 's death clouds the future of chechnya .
the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .

kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

" blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2004 a supermarket for the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this store can even beat aldi 's prices .
shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .
" we certainly have no lack of people who are needy , " he said . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eddie hannath , the general secretary of the normandy veterans ' association , told the paper he would regard it as " sacrilege " if schröder laid a wreath on british graves .
schröder was the first german leader to be invited to attend d-day ceremonies in january by the french government .
a spokesman for the german government said schröder 's agenda had not yet been set .
" nothing was fixed about going to see british war graves , and nothing was cancelled .
we ca n't comment on something that was never planned in the first place , " the spokesman said . more briefs 27.04.2004 -pipe- berlin offers aid in north korea blast 16.04.2004 -pipe- germans refuse to pay new fee for doctor 's visit 14.04.2004 -pipe- rent-a-crowd a hit on soccer circuit 14.04.2004 -pipe- corpulent kitty mikesch misses his mince 14.04.2004 -pipe- survey shows support rising for schröder 's spd 14.04.2004 -pipe- new analysis throws nazi porn claim into doubt 14.04.2004 -pipe- afghan soccer stars go on the run 02.04.2004 -pipe- most germans disapprove of chancellor schröder 's reforms 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "
keeping stocked the idea of a " social " supermarket is n't new .
since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .
the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

since the 1990s , the catholic charity caritas has operated between 20 and 30 similar projects across germany , and they have helped many a welfare recipient .
but even their longer established stores have had trouble keeping their shelves fully stocked .
" obviously these stores ca n't order products like normal stores , but we do have a well-developed network of donors , " said caritas spokesman thomas brock .
nor can the düsseldorf store guarantee that it can supply everyone with everything at anytime .
still , the money people save shopping at the flingern supermarket can be put towards buying the missing items at a normal store .
" when a customer comes to us and saves on basic groceries like flour and sugar , maybe they 'll have enough left over to buy bananas at the nearby grocery store , " horn said .
a community center the organizers of flinger mobil see their supermarket as far more than a charity organization .
they also see it as a meeting place for people who are often isolated or made to feel lonely by their poverty .
to that end , they 've set up a small cafe with complimentary coffee .

at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .
but in the longer term , we think we 'll have enough donors to get through . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2004 blair : government only recently learned of uk abuses in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu ghraib prison : uk and u.s. soldiers are purported to have abused iraqi prisoners here allegations that uk troops tortured iraqi prisoners are rocking britain .
prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2004 chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akhmed kadyrov 's death clouds the future of chechnya .
the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .
yet all that is set to change .
by 2005 , the empty le corbusier " house on stilts " is expected to be renovated and made into a museum .
the house , whose roof garden was revolutionary at the time , will explore the weimar era 's search for a fundamental rejuvenation of architecture .
until that happens , guided tours of weissenhof take place once a week in winter and twice a week in summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart : no grit , just green can visitors have fun in " the city where work is a pleasure ? "

the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

prime minister blair apologized for the abuses sunday , but the question remains as to how long the government has known about them . prime minister tony blair said monday his government had only been aware of its troops ' transgressions against iraqi prisoners for the " last few days . "
but human rights organization amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said they had warned the british government months ago that iraqi prisoners had been tortured and killed in uk custody . defense minister geoff hoon said monday britain had already begun investigating allegations that soldiers killed a prisoner when it received a red cross report documenting uk and u.s. mistreatment in february . " by the time the icrc referred to the case in their february report , a thorough investigation was already underway , " hoon said in parliament monday .
he acknowledged that two investigations into abuse could soon result in prosecution . the red cross report was published on the wall street journal web site monday , and the geneva-based organization confirmed its authenticity .
it dealt mainly with u.s. soldiers mistreatment of pows , and was , according to pierre kraehenbuehl , icrc director of operations , a summary of what the organization had told u.s. officials between march and november 2003 , reuters reported . amnesty international said it had alerted the british government to its soldiers ' abuses in a series of meetings throughout the past year . questions of authenticity hoon also cast doubt on the authenticity of pictures published in the daily mirror tabloid last week that kick-started the uk troops scandal .
" there are strong indications that the vehicle in which the photographs were taken was not in iraq during the relevant period , " hoon said .
" additional lines of inquiry are being pursued to corroborate this . " but daily mirror editor piers morgan said previously that testimony the paper received from a soldier substantiated what the photos showed .
several soldiers claimed in interviews with the mirror that their colleagues had abused iraqi prisoners , even beating one to death . the photographs are purported to show british troops urinating on and beating a prisoner in basra . last week armed forces minister adam ingram told the house of commons , the lower chamber of parliament , that 33 cases of british soldiers causing civilian deaths , injuries or ill treatment had been investigated in iraq . blair apologizes tony blair said he was sorry for the incidents in an interview during a visit to france on sunday .
" we 've already made it absolutely clear we apologize deeply to anyone who 's been mistreated by any of our soldiers .
that is absolutely and totally unacceptable , " blair told france 3 television .
" those who are responsible for this - if they have behaved in this appalling way - they will be punished according to the army disciplinary rules . " blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , was already shaken by the accusations that u.s. soldiers humiliated iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
blair had rested his case for joining the united states in war against saddam hussein on the search for weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- and the morality of fighting the iraqi dictatorship . the prime minister took a hard blow when no wmds were found .
now reports that uk troops , too , might be culpable of abusing prisoners has tarnished blair 's appeal to morality .
even some of his supporters have called for the beleaguered prime minister 's resignation . british public opinion has been split on whether uk troops should remain in iraq .
a poll carried out for the independent newspaper revealed that 55 percent of respondents want the country 's soldiers to leave iraq by june 30 , the date set for transferring sovereignty to an interim iraqi government .
in the united states in april , the media began publicizing graphic images of iraqi prisoners being humiliated and abused by american soldiers .
president bush apologized for the incidents last week , and defense secretary donald rumsfeld assumed responsibility for them .
although pressure has been growing on him to step down , he has thus far refused .
rumsfeld has since gotten a strong statement of support from president bush . seven u.s. soldiers have so far been charged with abusing prisoners in iraq . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " ahead of a three-day trip to washington , german foreign minster joschka fischer has called for those u.s. soldiers responsible for the " horrifying and repugnant " mistreatment of iraqi prisoners to be punished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2004 a supermarket for the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this store can even beat aldi 's prices .
shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "
horn is optimistic : " now , in the starting phase , we 're going to have to make some purchases on our own in order to keep the store fully stocked .

shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .
but a new grocery store in düsseldorf seeks to ease the problem . at about 100 square meters in size , the small grocery store in düsseldorf 's flingern neighborhood could be just like any other corner mom and pop shop .
the shelves lining the bright yellow walls are filled with cans , coffee and shampoo , just like a normal grocery store .
the only difference is that the goods on sale here cost 75 percent less than they do at other shops .
they 're all donations or gifts from local wholesalers and retailers .
some of the goods are near their expiration date and others are in damaged packaging .
the other difference is that you ca n't shop here unless you can prove you 're on welfare .
each shopper at the store is given a special customer card that can be used only during the duration of time a person is still eligible for government welfare benefits .
there are a number of places where the needy can get food in germany .
but the local organization flinger mobil decided from the very start to open a grocery store so that poor people , too , could have the feeling that they were shopping just like everyone else .
" even though they 're only paying 25 percent of the normal prices , they should be treated like regular customers , " the organization 's chairman , carsten horn , said .
so far demand has been large and the range of goods simple .
during the first few hours after the store opened on may 4 , around 30 customers dropped by .
" some things are already sold out , " said horn .
" but we 're going to take great care to line up the appropriate donors , even if that wo n't be made easier in times of economic weakness . "

the store 's employees contribute to that atmosphere .
at any given time there are three volunteers working .
horn was astounded by the resonance he encountered while looking for people willing to work at the store without pay .
" we had 25 people contact us spontaneously , " he said .
volunteers at the store are constantly chatting with customers and providing them with advice .
that kind of extra assistance is an extremely important aspect of their work .
horn said that in their work with people in the area 's lower economic strata , that advice is crucial .
" we have to assume that not every customer here knows how to handle fresh groceries , " he explained .
" experience has shown us that many families do n't even know , for example , how to turn a head of lettuce into a bowl of salad . "
the store is currently being operated in a building that belongs to a local church , which has waved any rental fees for the first year-and-a-half of business .
after that , flingern mobil will have to pay rent .
but with the growing daily demand for the store , that should n't be a problem .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2004 chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akhmed kadyrov 's death clouds the future of chechnya .
the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region . a day after the 52-year-old former muslim cleric and leader of the rebel province chechnya died in a bomb attack in a stadium in the capital grozny on sunday , thousands of mourners headed to his hometown of tsentoroi to pay their final tributes .
the interfax news agency said police posts were set up every 100 meters along the 200-kilometer long highway crossing chechnya from east to west to provide security for guests arriving from neighboring provinces to attend the three-day funeral ceremonies .
" kadyrov 's death has left a political vacuum in chechnya , " russian parliamentary deputy ramazan abdulatipov told ekho moskvy radio .
" it turns out that there is no one to pick up his banner , " he said .
a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .

a top target for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run just seconds after an explosion which tore through a stadium in the chechen capital grozny where they were attending victory day observances on may 9 , 2004 .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on sunday which exploded at a ceremony celebrating the 1945 victory over nazi germany and killed at least six others , but suspicion falls on the chechen separatists , who have been fighting for independence from moscow since the mid-1990 's .
kadyrov has long been a top target for the rebels and has survived several assassination attempts .
a former rebel leader who later turned pro-kremlin , kadyrov was the political figure entrusted by russian president vladimir putin to put an end to nearly ten years of separatist war in chechnya .
as such he was particularly hated by the pro-separatist factions , who regarded him as a turncoat and a puppet of moscow .
his death is now being viewed as a blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability in the region .
putin has already vowed to avenge the attack , saying " justice will take the upper hand and retribution is inevitable for terrorists . "
in televised remarks , he also called kadyrov a " heroic person " who demonstrated the difference between " bandits , terrorists and the chechen people " - a distinction putin strives to make between those in chechnya who support russia and those who continue to fight for independence from moscow .

kadyrov was a man who embodied the changes putin hoped to force upon the break-away region .
during the first chechnya war -lrb- 1994-96 -rrb- , kadyrov rose to a position of mufti , the spiritual head of the muslim community and proclaimed a holy war or jihad against russia .
but when russian forces withdrew and the region regained a sense of independence , kadyrov became disenchanted with other rebel leaders , blaming them for over-reliance on foreign help .
he broke with aslan maskhadov , who had been elected chechen president in 1997 .
when war broke out again in 1999 , kadyrov sided with russia and was soon appointed head of the moscow-installed administration by putin , who sought to minimize russia 's military involvement in chechnya and encourage chechens to solve their own problems .
kadyrov proved to be an ideal instrument .
he stayed loyal and managed to persuade many rebel commanders and rank-and-file fighters to lay down their arms , primarily through force and scare tactics .
his son ramzan headed up the powerful and much-feared military which has been accused of being behind civilian disappearances and extrajudicial killings of unrepentant rebels .
last october kadyrov was elected president in a vote widely criticized by the international community as fraudulent .
news reports say that russian officials pledged a new presidential election would be held within four months , as stipulated in the country 's constitution .
in the meantime , prime minister sergei abramov - another pro-kremlin figure , will act as president . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .

originally derided , the homes today are considered architectural gems - well worth a visit . walter gropius , ludwig mies van der rohe , hans scharoun and le corbusier are just a few of the architects who designed parts of a model housing settlement for a 1927 exhibition called " the dwelling , " which aimed to be a platform for the nascent new construction movement .
while half of the original designs were destroyed in world war ii , those that remain make up the weissenhof settlement in the stuttgart neighborhood of killesberg .
innovative concept the experimental settlement gave the largely young and progressive modernist architects the chance to design homes " for the modern city dweller , from blue-collar workers to the upper middle class . "
they used new construction materials intended to keep costs low and building times short - an innovative concept at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig mies van der rohe , by the spring of 1926 , the team working under the german architect mies van der rohe -lrb- photo -rrb- included peter behrens and josef frank from vienna , ludwig hilbersheimer , hans poelzig and bruno und max taut from berlin , the frenchman le corbusier and his cousin pierre jeanneret , walter gropius from dessau , and mart stam from rotterdam .
in its day , the weissenhof settlement sparked controversy .
the 21 houses , with their 63 apartments , were unveiled to great applause .
some half million visitors came to visit the " dwelling " exhibit .
but conservatives criticized the project as being inhuman , unrealistic - and eventually , anti-german .
the modernist models were called a " suburb of jerusalem , " and a " swabian living-machine , " and ridiculed as " squish-and-squeeze single family homes " and " a product of theater architects . "
' degenerate ' architecture during the third reich , the settlement was referred to as an " arabian village , " " culturally bolshevistic " and " degenerate . "
it was supposed to be replaced by a huge building complex for the general command of the wehrmacht , but these plans were put off by the advent of wwii .
during the war , 10 of the 21 original buildings were lost to bombs .
afterward the buildings came a hair 's breath from being razed during the post-war " economic miracle " building boom .
finally , the remaining 11 buildings were placed under historic monument protection in 1956 .
most of them had been fully restored by 1982 .
plans for museum devoid of ornamentation , simple and bright , the end result is a grouping of apartments and houses that manages to be visually harmonious despite the various architects who worked together on the project .
but while architecture afficionados around the world know about the development , up to now the city of stuttgart has not done much to exploit it as a potential tourist site .
there are few signs pointing the way to the buildings , and only a small office on the site currently informs visitors about the settlement and its role in the architecture of the era .

the move will mean people who are already drawing company pensions will become worse off as a result , he said .
and the fund will not offer protection to an estimated 60,000 people who are already at risk of losing all or part of their retirement savings because of a failed company scheme .
employers ' liability the new measures are designed to help workers before the pension protection fund comes in next year under the pensions bill .
employers operating pension schemes will have to pay into the fund , which will compensate workers if their company pension scheme is wound up .
in addition , a pension regulator will be set up to ensure new rules are followed and to combat fraud .

blogger , which is owned by google , has redesigned its site to make it easier to use and added new features , including posting by e-mail .
" the focus is on lifting the barrier to start blogging , " said evan williams , co-founder of blogger .
there are hundreds of thousands of blogs , creating an eco-system of ever-changing ideas on the net .
mainstream appeal blogger is one of many free web-based services that helps people share their thoughts on the net , without writing code or installing software .
the service has changed little since it was bought by google in february 2003 .
blogging has shown itself to be a fundamental part of the web .
but we still have a tremendous way to go evan williams , blogger but in the meantime , rival services have sprung up and others have been innovating furiously .
blogger is racing to make up time with a new look and tools to let people do more with their blogs .
" we 're aiming at expanding the user base and appealing to the mainstream internet audience , " mr williams told bbc news online .
as part of the overhaul , blogger is adding a facility to post to a blog via e-mail , as well as a comments box .
it has also done a deal with a company called hello to let subscribers upload photos directly to a blog .
among the other changes are 26 new templates and new profile pages so that bloggers can learn more about each other .
early days blogs have mushroomed in the past couple of years since free software became widely available , allowing people with no technical know-how to create and quickly update internet sites at little or no expense .
blogging tools blogger radio userland movable type grey matter tongue wag 20six google does not release figures for the number of active bloggers .
but at the time it bought the company last year , blogger had some 200,000 online diarists .
one of its rivals , livejournal , says it has 3,082,448 subscribers , out of which 1,482,196 are described as active .
anyone can set up a blog for free on blogger .
accounts are by default hosted on blogspot , a storage site owned by blogger .
free accounts have ads on their pages but there is the option to pay for ad-free space .
" blogging has shown itself to be a fundamental part of the web , " said mr williams .
" but we still have a tremendous way to go . "
as for the future , mr williams said they would be looking at incorporating google 's search technology into blogger , offering subscribers the ability to search their blog .

local government must also compensate poorer residents whatever the inflation rate if prices for water , power and transport are raised .
the policy is the latest in a series of attempts by beijing to take soaring economic growth off the boil .
earlier in may , prime minister wen jiabao said he was readying " forceful " steps to calm the economy .
surging investment in construction and other fixed assets such as industrial machinery has driven growth to 9.1 % for 2003 .
the first three months of 2004 exceeded even that , with expansion of 9.7 % on an annual basis .
prices are rising too as demand builds - up 2.8 % in the same period , with food prices up 7.9 % in march from the same month a year earlier .
the planned curbs on utility price rises will cut in where inflation tops 1 % a month or 4 % year on year for three months in a row .
they follow limits placed on lending by state banks - in other words , the banking sector in general , already hobbled by massive bad debts to underperforming state firms .

tidy northern ireland director ian cole said a major survey showed that " 95 % of the country was clean " but efforts were hampered by those who continue to drop litter .
" ratepayers fork out over £ 22m a year to keep northern ireland tidy , and judging by our results they get very good value for money , " mr cole said .
the tidy northern ireland survey will be presented to environment minister angela smith on monday .
overall improvement armagh and castlereagh came top in the survey of about 1,500 sites in 26 council areas .
it found an overall improvement in street cleanliness and in council-owned facilities .
tidy northern ireland found cause for concern in the amount of cartons and cans , fast food and sweet wrappers being discarded .
more positively , dog fouling has dropped to a low of 9 % - with six councils including moyle and larne having none at all .
mr cole said too many people were still either " too lazy or too ignorant " to use a bin .
" with recent legislation doubling the fine for littering to £ 50 what we need now is for the authorities to dish more out and send a powerful message to the public that dropping litter will not be tolerated in northern ireland , " he added .

he joined the firm , then known as norwich union , in 1992 as chief executive of the group 's new zealand interests and moved back to the uk a year later as general manager of finance .
he was responsible for norwich union 's 1997 floatation and in 2000 led its merger with cgu to form cgnu - now known as aviva .
the following year he was named chief executive .
mr harvey is also chairman of the association of british insurers - the uk industry body for insurers .
what was your first car ?
an austin a35 saloon for which i paid £ 45 in 1969 .
it 's easily my favourite car as it signified the quantum leap into independent personal transport .
the car had a light beige exterior and a friendly , rounded , shape with the sort of mechanics which meant that roadside repairs could be effected with nothing more than a few spanners .
i have never lost my fondness for this sturdy and practical run-around .
what was your first job - and for what wage ?
my first job was as a saturday morning shop boy in the village ironmonger 's .
i was paid 1s 9d -lrb- about 9p for younger readers -rrb- per hour .
the tardis-like nature of the village shop , with endless quantities of loose ironmongery , was a delight and joy for a schoolboy with a good memory and an interest in the practical .
what did you buy as a first home - and how much was it ?
my first house was a red brick terrace in folkestone , backing on to the main line railway .
it cost £ 6,000 in 1972 .
with trains passing every hour and a half , it had the great advantage that sleep deprivation forced unwelcome visitors to stay no more than two days .
who is your biggest inspiration and why ?
my biggest inspiration has definitely been my family and friends .
as for heroes , i would probably go for ernest shackleton because of his amazing leadership in saving his entire team of antarctic explorers on his expedition on the endurance what is the best piece of business advice you 've had ?
always give two commendations for every recommendation .
it is just as important to reinforce the positive elements in your team you wish to foster as it is to correct or criticise the less acceptable .
in fact , this balance makes it easy for anybody to accept constructive criticism , whilst accepting that they are valued for the majority of their work which they perform well .
name the proudest moment in your career .
the successful flotation of norwich union was , undoubtedly , my proudest moment .
it was easily the largest and most complex project for which i have been responsible .
it combined every aspect of the business , its financial construction , geographical split , and customer relationships .
aviva is the world 's seventh-largest insurance group - based on gross worldwide premiums - and the biggest in the uk , where it trades as norwich union .
the company it is now one of the leading providers of life and pensions products to europe and has substantial businesses elsewhere around the world .

the new cards will replace existing credit and debit cards with a more secure system that requires people to enter a personal identification number by using a keypad .
they will be difficult to use by some people with visual impairments , people who have difficulty with manual dexterity and those who are unable to memorise numbers .
issuing institutions have agreed that anyone who has difficulty with a chip and pin card will have the option of using their signature instead .
since this facility will have to be programmed onto the card , the rnib says that call centre staff need to be aware of this difference .
it conducted a mystery telephone shopping exercise at the beginning of april which found that more than two-thirds of callers were given misleading , inaccurate or , in some cases , no information on the choice between chip and pin and chip and signature cards .
" rnib believes that blind and partially sighted customers should be better informed by their card issuers about the choice they have , " said spokesman , bill alker .
" we advise people with sight problems to speak with their card providers sooner rather than later . "
even buying a drink at the local will involve using a keypad chip and pin - the organisation set up to launch the new technology - says it is taking the rnib 's findings " seriously " .
" we are working hard to try and improve the accuracy of the information people get from their call centres , " said sandra quinn , a chip and pin spokesperson .
" but this is a huge training job - we need to ensure that more than 200,000 staff are retrained over time . "
chip and pin has conducted its own research among disabled people which , it says , shows that the majority welcome the new system .
its findings are based on responses from 350 disabled and elderly cardholders in 11 locations around the uk .
more than 80 percent were happy to use the new system including 27 out of 29 visually impaired cardholders interviewed .
but the rnib 's concerns relate to people who know - or think they know - that they will experience problems with chip and pin cards .
it says card issuers must provide customers with the option to continue to use their signature to authorise purchases .
the mystery shopping exercise will be repeated in july , but this time the rnib is threatening to name the worst offenders .

members of the transport and general workers union -lrb- t & g -rrb- who work for stagecoach north west had planned to take part in a 24-hour strike .
but a stagecoach spokeswoman said on sunday that the industrial action had been called off and services would be operating as normal .
drivers voted last month to strike in a row over pay .
workers based at barrow , carlisle , kendal and west cumbria have been involved in the dispute .

mice fed a high-fat diet lost 30 % of their body weight in just four weeks on the treatment - originally designed to combat cancer .
however , scientists at the university of texas warn development is at an early stage , and there is a high potential risk of side effects .
their work is published in the journal nature medicine .
if even a fraction of what we found in mice relates to human biology , then we are cautiously optimistic that there may be a new way to think about reversing obesity .
dr renata pasqualini each fat cell in the body is connected to many tiny capillaries , giving them a rich supply of blood on which to thrive .
the researchers , at the university of texas ' anderson cancer centre , identified a protein - prohibitin - that identifies fat cells and helps to construct the network of blood vessels that feed them .
they made the protein lethal by attaching it to another protein that triggers the cells in the blood vessels to commit suicide .
the modified combination proved to be highly effective at destroying fat tissue by dismantling its blood supply , effectively starving it to death .
when it was injected into mice they ate less food , and seemed to have a higher metabolic rate .
side effects the animals also seemed to tolerate the treatment well , showing few signs of side effects .
however , it is known that loss of fat cells can have detrimental effects - such as the accumulation of fat in non-fat tissue .
the researchers also warned that other research which has produced startling results in rodents has failed to produce the same effect in humans .
the next step will be to test the treatment on baboons , which do put on weight in the same way as humans .
researcher dr renata pasqualini said : " if even a fraction of what we found in mice relates to human biology , then we are cautiously optimistic that there may be a new way to think about reversing obesity . "
the treatment is similar to a new class of anti-cancer drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors which starve tumours by cutting off their blood supply .
dr ian campbell , chairman of the uk national obesity forum , told bbc news online the drug appeared to work in a different way from those already on the market .
he said : " this is a fascinating study , and these guys are clearly at the leading edge of technology .
" but this is a long , long , long way from being a drug that is applicable to humans . "
professor ian macdonald , an expert on metabolic physiology , told bbc news online he had concerns about what would happen to fat tissue destroyed by the treatment .
he said there was potential for it to lead to excessively high fat levels in the blood .
" this may end up being better as a preventative treatment to stop being becoming obese in the first place , " he said .
obesity is a significant , and growing problem throughout the developed world .
