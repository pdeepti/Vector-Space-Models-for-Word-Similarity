foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .
" the only thing the un security council has delivered is ... another 30 days in which civilians will continue to live in fear of being killed or raped .
the government of sudan will be celebrating yet another failure to call them to account .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .
a nucleus of future operations nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called the mission a " nucleus " of future operations at a news conference and admitted that while the agreement was an important political milestone for the alliance , in military terms it represented only a modest contribution to the efforts to stabilize iraq .
after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .
" today 's decision for us represents the unification of nato ...
we 've come together in a way that we could not a year-and-a-half ago . "

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .
a nucleus of future operations nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called the mission a " nucleus " of future operations at a news conference and admitted that while the agreement was an important political milestone for the alliance , in military terms it represented only a modest contribution to the efforts to stabilize iraq .
after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .
" today 's decision for us represents the unification of nato ...
we 've come together in a way that we could not a year-and-a-half ago . "

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .

sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2004 for some german architects , it 's easy being green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the sun shine : a solar settlement near freiburg an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .
it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .
low cost loans and other perks are funded on many levels , from state and local all the way up through europe-wide programs .
according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .
but while good for the environment , ecologically-friendly buildings are not automatically beautiful or interesting to look at .

it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .
low cost loans and other perks are funded on many levels , from state and local all the way up through europe-wide programs .
according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2004 for some german architects , it 's easy being green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the sun shine : a solar settlement near freiburg an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .
it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .
low cost loans and other perks are funded on many levels , from state and local all the way up through europe-wide programs .
according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .
but while good for the environment , ecologically-friendly buildings are not automatically beautiful or interesting to look at .
however , this is not the case with those in the exhibit .
" when most people think of german architecture , they still think of walter gropius and mies van der rohe .
we wanted to show that german architecture has gone beyond bauhaus , " said dr. barbara honrath , of the munich goethe institute , which organized the exhibit . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the solar settlement -lrb- solarsiedlung -rrb- solar energy powered homes near freiburg werner sobek engineers all about the man who made r128 rolf disch architects , solar energy specialist eurosolar : european assoc. for renewable energies 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .
" the only thing the un security council has delivered is ... another 30 days in which civilians will continue to live in fear of being killed or raped .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .
" the only thing the un security council has delivered is ... another 30 days in which civilians will continue to live in fear of being killed or raped .
the government of sudan will be celebrating yet another failure to call them to account .

-lrb- july 26 , 2004 -rrb- fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .

it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .
low cost loans and other perks are funded on many levels , from state and local all the way up through europe-wide programs .
according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .
but while good for the environment , ecologically-friendly buildings are not automatically beautiful or interesting to look at .
however , this is not the case with those in the exhibit .
" when most people think of german architecture , they still think of walter gropius and mies van der rohe .

it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2004 for some german architects , it 's easy being green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the sun shine : a solar settlement near freiburg an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .
it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .
low cost loans and other perks are funded on many levels , from state and local all the way up through europe-wide programs .
according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .
but while good for the environment , ecologically-friendly buildings are not automatically beautiful or interesting to look at .
however , this is not the case with those in the exhibit .
" when most people think of german architecture , they still think of walter gropius and mies van der rohe .

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .
a nucleus of future operations nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called the mission a " nucleus " of future operations at a news conference and admitted that while the agreement was an important political milestone for the alliance , in military terms it represented only a modest contribution to the efforts to stabilize iraq .
after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .
" today 's decision for us represents the unification of nato ...

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .

after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2004 great war generation no longer around , legacy remains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 8.5 million men from 16 different countries lost their lives ninety years ago this weekend , the first , confused steps were taken to europe 's first bloody war of the 20th century .
not only would the great war kill millions , it planted the seeds that would eventually start wwii . on the afternoon of aug .
1 , 1914 , lucien finance watched as a group of german soldiers marched through his small city , triumphal march music blaring .
like the rest of his friends , finance ran behind the proud soldiers , off to fight on the first of what would become one of the most brutal wars in history .
" then , my dad said , ' within the next few days , they will stop playing music , " ' finance recalled at a gathering of survivors in 1998 .
his prophecy proved to be true , and music and laughter disappeared from europe for four dark years beginning 90 years ago on sunday .
the great war , as it has gone down into the annals of history , provided a bloody start to the 20th century .
the advances made in technology and science would be put to deadly use for the first time .
railroads , tanks and poison gas would ensure that an average of 6,000 soldiers died every day of the war .
millions were killed between aug .
1 , 1914 and nov .
11 , 1918 , in a war that moved borders a few miles and at the end of which little got resolved .
historians to this day are in disagreement over who bears the most responsibility in starting the slaughter .
tangle of alliances pulls europeans into war the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo on july 28 , 1914 in any case set things in motion .
the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archduke of austria franz ferdinand and his wife sophie just minutes before both are killed successor to the throne of the austro-hungarian empire was murdered by serbian nationalist gavrilo princip .
the complicated tangle of alliances at the time ignited the fast burning flame that would eventually spark all of europe into battle just five weeks later .
germany spurned russia to join the austro-hungarian empire in declaring war on serbia .
russia , allied with serbia , moved troops to its borders with germany prompting kaiser wilhelm , on aug .
1 , 1914 , to declare war on russia .
with visions of grandeur dancing in his head , the kaiser declared war on france and eventually belgium just a few days later .
great britain , pledging to protect belgium , entered the fray soon after .
the leaders dragged their somewhat confused , yet spirited populations with them in their wake .
" in the summer when the war began , most of us were content with our lives , " recalled albert sharpff , a german veteran who was 18 at the time .
" we were relatively prosperous and the last war had happened a long time ago . "
a war of horrific dimensions the short war that everyone had expected soon turned long and bloody .
over the next four years , more than 8.5 million men from 16 countries , ranging from russia to the u.s. and japan died .
the trench warfare and use of poison gas gave the war new and horrific dimensions .
the long winters prolonged the agony .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needed for the first time : gas masks " i was at the front in ypres .
everything was frozen and slippery and i slipped and fell into a shell hole and saw eyes shining through the ice , " recalled ted kimmer , then a 16-year-old soldier who left his home in southport , england to fight .
" i had landed on a frozen pile of dead corpses … i was scared to death . "
news of peace , but not a long one the young men who had spent the best years of their life at war could hardly believe it when news of a general armistice was announced on nov .
11 , 1918 .
a few weeks later , the central powers and the u.s. , japan , france , britain and italy met in paris to hammer out a peace agreement .
germany was on the losing side of the war , and wilhelm had already abdicated his throne .
in the treaty of versailles , the allied powers forced germany to completely disarm , give up prussia and silesia in the north and the saarland in the south and pay millions in reparations .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .
" the only thing the un security council has delivered is ... another 30 days in which civilians will continue to live in fear of being killed or raped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2004 training role for nato troops in baghdad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops will soon join coalition forces - but only to train iraqis after meeting for the sixth time in three days , nato members finally agreed to send a small contingent of troops to iraq to train the country 's armed forces and help rebuild its military infrastructure . a spat between the united states and france was not enough to stop nato members eventually agreeing to dispatch " as soon as possible " a small group of officers to iraq to train the country 's military after envoys from the 26 allied nations met for the sixth time in three days on an issue that had rekindled tensions over last year 's iraq war .
the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .
a nucleus of future operations nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called the mission a " nucleus " of future operations at a news conference and admitted that while the agreement was an important political milestone for the alliance , in military terms it represented only a modest contribution to the efforts to stabilize iraq .
after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .
" today 's decision for us represents the unification of nato ...
we 've come together in a way that we could not a year-and-a-half ago . "
the remaining details of the mission will be thrashed out at the next nato meeting in september . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato seeks consensus on iraq nato ambassadors have so far failed to reach a consensus on the training of iraqi security forces .
with critical differences between washington and paris , the talks have enter a third day on thursday .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .
a nucleus of future operations nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called the mission a " nucleus " of future operations at a news conference and admitted that while the agreement was an important political milestone for the alliance , in military terms it represented only a modest contribution to the efforts to stabilize iraq .
after announcing that the nato officers would leave for iraq in early august to help the insurgency-plagued government rebuild its ministry of defense and military headquarters , de hoop scheffer declared : " this alliance is united on iraq . "
" it 's a distinct nato mission , " he continued but added that the us-led multinational force would give protection and " there should be a relationship between the training mission and multinational force in iraq . "
deadlocked over details the idea of nato training for iraqi forces was agreed by leaders at a nato summit in istanbul in june .
but ambassadors had been deadlocked in recent days over details .
the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .
u.s. ambassador to nato nicholas burns was satisfied that nato had agreed to have a genuine presence in iraq and said he expected the training force to grow rapidly into the hundreds within months .
the unification of nato " the nato flag is definitely going to be in baghdad , " he said at a press conference .
" today 's decision for us represents the unification of nato ...
we 've come together in a way that we could not a year-and-a-half ago . "

the agreement to finally raise the nato flag in baghdad , under which fewer than 40 officers will operate in a purely training role , came after the united states , faced with resistance from france , agreed to shelve its demand that the mission come under u.s.-led coalition command .
washington had been calling for an immediate decision to put nato 's mission under the command of the u.s.-led multinational force in iraq , arguing this was essential to ensure the safety of nato staff in a dangerous environment .
france feared this would be the thin end of the wedge , inserting nato into the iraqi battlefield through a back door .

the wording of the summit accord had been left vague because of french and german resistance to an overt or collective role for the alliance in iraq , forcing alliance envoys back around the table to agree on details .

not only would the great war kill millions , it planted the seeds that would eventually start wwii . on the afternoon of aug .
1 , 1914 , lucien finance watched as a group of german soldiers marched through his small city , triumphal march music blaring .
like the rest of his friends , finance ran behind the proud soldiers , off to fight on the first of what would become one of the most brutal wars in history .
" then , my dad said , ' within the next few days , they will stop playing music , " ' finance recalled at a gathering of survivors in 1998 .
his prophecy proved to be true , and music and laughter disappeared from europe for four dark years beginning 90 years ago on sunday .
the great war , as it has gone down into the annals of history , provided a bloody start to the 20th century .
the advances made in technology and science would be put to deadly use for the first time .
railroads , tanks and poison gas would ensure that an average of 6,000 soldiers died every day of the war .
millions were killed between aug .
1 , 1914 and nov .
11 , 1918 , in a war that moved borders a few miles and at the end of which little got resolved .
historians to this day are in disagreement over who bears the most responsibility in starting the slaughter .
tangle of alliances pulls europeans into war the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo on july 28 , 1914 in any case set things in motion .
the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archduke of austria franz ferdinand and his wife sophie just minutes before both are killed successor to the throne of the austro-hungarian empire was murdered by serbian nationalist gavrilo princip .
the complicated tangle of alliances at the time ignited the fast burning flame that would eventually spark all of europe into battle just five weeks later .
germany spurned russia to join the austro-hungarian empire in declaring war on serbia .
russia , allied with serbia , moved troops to its borders with germany prompting kaiser wilhelm , on aug .
1 , 1914 , to declare war on russia .
with visions of grandeur dancing in his head , the kaiser declared war on france and eventually belgium just a few days later .
great britain , pledging to protect belgium , entered the fray soon after .
the leaders dragged their somewhat confused , yet spirited populations with them in their wake .
" in the summer when the war began , most of us were content with our lives , " recalled albert sharpff , a german veteran who was 18 at the time .
" we were relatively prosperous and the last war had happened a long time ago . "
a war of horrific dimensions the short war that everyone had expected soon turned long and bloody .
over the next four years , more than 8.5 million men from 16 countries , ranging from russia to the u.s. and japan died .
the trench warfare and use of poison gas gave the war new and horrific dimensions .
the long winters prolonged the agony .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : needed for the first time : gas masks " i was at the front in ypres .
everything was frozen and slippery and i slipped and fell into a shell hole and saw eyes shining through the ice , " recalled ted kimmer , then a 16-year-old soldier who left his home in southport , england to fight .
" i had landed on a frozen pile of dead corpses … i was scared to death . "
news of peace , but not a long one the young men who had spent the best years of their life at war could hardly believe it when news of a general armistice was announced on nov .
11 , 1918 .
a few weeks later , the central powers and the u.s. , japan , france , britain and italy met in paris to hammer out a peace agreement .
germany was on the losing side of the war , and wilhelm had already abdicated his throne .
in the treaty of versailles , the allied powers forced germany to completely disarm , give up prussia and silesia in the north and the saarland in the south and pay millions in reparations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied leaders french premier george clemenceau , standing , center ; u.s. president woodrow wilson , seated at left ; italian foreign minister giorgio sinnino ; and british prime minister lloyd george present for the signing of the versailles treaty by germany .
the defeat and the conditions of the treaty were designed to humiliate germany , and they did .
so much so , that a group calling themselves the national socialist party won unprecendeted popularity in elections in the early 1930s .
they were led by a hateful , rhetorically-gifted austrian who tapped into his country 's vein of discontent and rode it into power .
soon , the drums of war would bang again .
and 20 years after the first great war ended , the world was on the brink of a new one - even more deadly than the last . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historians split on german wwi role aug .

germany spurned russia to join the austro-hungarian empire in declaring war on serbia .
russia , allied with serbia , moved troops to its borders with germany prompting kaiser wilhelm , on aug .

the leaders dragged their somewhat confused , yet spirited populations with them in their wake .
" in the summer when the war began , most of us were content with our lives , " recalled albert sharpff , a german veteran who was 18 at the time .
" we were relatively prosperous and the last war had happened a long time ago . "
a war of horrific dimensions the short war that everyone had expected soon turned long and bloody .
over the next four years , more than 8.5 million men from 16 countries , ranging from russia to the u.s. and japan died .
the trench warfare and use of poison gas gave the war new and horrific dimensions .
the long winters prolonged the agony .

germany was on the losing side of the war , and wilhelm had already abdicated his throne .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .

the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .

not only would the great war kill millions , it planted the seeds that would eventually start wwii . on the afternoon of aug .
1 , 1914 , lucien finance watched as a group of german soldiers marched through his small city , triumphal march music blaring .
like the rest of his friends , finance ran behind the proud soldiers , off to fight on the first of what would become one of the most brutal wars in history .
" then , my dad said , ' within the next few days , they will stop playing music , " ' finance recalled at a gathering of survivors in 1998 .
his prophecy proved to be true , and music and laughter disappeared from europe for four dark years beginning 90 years ago on sunday .
the great war , as it has gone down into the annals of history , provided a bloody start to the 20th century .
the advances made in technology and science would be put to deadly use for the first time .
railroads , tanks and poison gas would ensure that an average of 6,000 soldiers died every day of the war .
millions were killed between aug .

the deal , which is a positive step toward a 147-nation pact that lowers border barriers and enables exporters to sell their goods in more markets , came after days of hard bargaining and negotiations .
the official deadline for the deal passed at midnight on friday but members hunkered down through the early hours of saturday morning and the rest of the day to reach agreement .
industrialized nations find subsidy compromise eventually , industrialized nations , including the united states , eu members and japan , offered a compromise where they scaled back protection for their farmers in exchange for boosting trading opportunities for products ranging from computers to cars .
it was a major breakthrough on the main sticking point of agriculture , which had stalled the talks .
about 70 percent of the world 's poor live in rural areas and earn their income from farming .
the € 153 billion -lrb- $ 184 billion -rrb- in subsidies and other forms of aid the us , eu and japan give each year to support their farmers have been the biggest obstacles to reaching a broad wto agreement to dismantle trade barriers .
emergency negotiations were necessary after the wto released a new compromise text on friday in an attempt to overcome resistance to the mainly agricultural stumbling blocks but within hours of delegates receiving the new draft of the agreement , it became clear there were still major problems with the text .
problems in new draft meant extended work several countries raised objections to the section covering agriculture specifically references to subsidies and tariffs , and as the deadline drew near , a small group of members worked diligently to iron out the problems .
but as the deadline for an agreement passed , no deal had been made and the core group of countries continued to work into the small hours .
the hard works seems to have paid off but there is still to be a final agreement on the exact nature of the pact .
even so , what looked to be a losing battle has now been turned into a single victory in an ongoing war .
if ratified , the successful agreement will add some € 420 billion -lrb- $ 520 billion -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , with most of it going to poorer countries , according to projections from the world bank . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto issues new plan as time runs out in a bid to make a breakthrough in deadlocked talks on global trade , world trade organization negotiators put forward a compromise plan as the deadline for agreement nears .

foreign minister mustafa osman ismail said the resolution passed on friday did not go beyond commitments khartoum made in early july to un chief kofi annan to rein in the government-supported militias .
" if we look closely at this matter , we will find out that there is no reason to reject the resolution as it does n't contain anything new , anything other than what already has been signed on in the agreement with the united nations , " ismail told reporters .
sudan seen to have failed in pledge the resolution gives the sudanese government 30 days to act against the janjaweed arab militias , after international officials decreed that sudan had failed to honor its pledges to crack down on the janjaweed who have brutally attacked black african farmers in darfur .
the conflict has been raging since last year when black sudanese rebels attacked government property , accusing the government of neglecting darfur in favor of the arab population in sudan .
the government responded by setting up the janjaweed to put down the rebellion .
human rights groups estimate 15,000 to 30,000 civilians have been killed and more than 1.2 million people have been left homeless .
meanwhile , about 200 french troops already stationed in chad prepared to be sent to the border with sudan to help the relief effort in darfur as a planeload of u.n. aid was dispatched to the eastern region of the sudan 's neighbor .
estimates show that as many as 50,000 people have been killed and more than a million displaced after raids by the janjaweed , which has been blamed for mass rapes , killings and burning of villages in the darfur region .
aid agencies fear consequences of un inaction an anonymous representative from one of the major aid agencies in darfur told bbc online that many organizations in the region believe the resolution has been fatally weakened by the changes which saw the removal of the threat of sanctions .
" the security council have today proved unanimous in their inaction , " the source said .
" the only thing the un security council has delivered is ... another 30 days in which civilians will continue to live in fear of being killed or raped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2004 for some german architects , it 's easy being green großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the sun shine : a solar settlement near freiburg an exhibit on ecologically friendly architecture in germany just began a world tour .
it highlights the country 's position at the forefront of a growing movement in ' green ' building techniques . the german architect and engineer werner sobek has made quite a splash with his home , called r128 , which he completed in 2000 .
the house - perched on a hillside in stuttgart - is made entirely of glass , allowing unobstructed views over four full stories .
it also relies exclusively on infrared sensors instead of handles , with doors popping open and faucets shutting on and off at the wave of a hand .
but while r128 has received plenty of press coverage for its radical design , the architect himself stresses its importance in another area : as part of an increasing trend toward ' sustainable ' german architecture r 128 is one of nine buildings featured in the exhibit " made in germany : architecture & ecology " , which opened in barcelona on july 6 , and will travel to 14 other cities before it closes , in april 2006 .
the buildings featured range from personal homes , such as r128 and a solar-housing settlement near freiburg , to a daycare center whose roof collects rainwater used to flush the toilets , to a ' zero energy ' subterranean train station -lrb- lit by cathedral-like skylights at ground level -rrb- .
there is also a " zero emissions factory , " a high rise that makes use of thermal energy , and the " heliotrope , " a solar-energy powered building that rotates to follow the sun .
combining old and modern as diverse as they are stylistic , the buildings in this exhibit share a strong penchant for using renewable energy sources , like the sun , wind , and thermal air .
some architects returned to old-fashioned building-preserving techniques , such as enhancing the use of trapped air for insulation , while others relied entirely on cutting-edge building components and newly developed engineering methods .
one thing these buildings do have in common : it took a client with interests in furthering the cause of ' green ' architecture to get the job done .
this is because , while it may pay off in the long run , ecological architecture is usually expensive to build .
" solar components pay themselves off in about 15 years , and photovoltaic roofs for generating electricity can pay off in around 20 years , but only because of strong state subventions , " says prof. fried ranft , of the aachen based ecological-architecture firm casa .
ecological building is a growth industry , ranft says .
this is because " people realise it pays off , cost wise .
plus , they feel good about themselves , they feel good in their home . "
sobek , who built r128 , refuses to say what it cost for him to build .
but he does say that the design stemmed from his desire making " ephemeral architecture , " - architecture that can be removed by future generations without leaving any waste behind .
" most houses are made of composites .
look at a wall – there is wallpaper pasted to gypsum board , on top of insulation , with wires embedded in it … many layers .
then when you dispose of it , it becomes landfill , and the toxic elements leak into the environment , " sobek said .
but r128 can either be taken down and reconstructed elsewhere , or be broken down into four recyclable components : glass , steel , aluminum , and wood .
" the only toxic leftover of my four-story house would be 2 kilograms of insulating foil .
that ’ s the only thing i don ’ t know what to do with , " sobek added .
germany in the forefront in 2002 , a similar exhibit in the united states - called ten shades of green - featured nine instances of ecological architecture from around the world .
of these , four were german .
this overwhelming presence is a testament to a general interest in conservation in germany , and to considerable government financial support .
german policy – in the form of legislation , r & d investment , and financial advantages for builders encourages the use of renewable resources .
one key to this is the renewable energy sources act , which obliges electricity grid operators to give priority to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources , and to pay a specified price for it .
with this regulation , investors know for certain that they can sell their electricity at a fixed rate for 20 years , and banks are apt to provide financing .
this has resulted in the desired boom in the construction of new renewable-energy installations .
the renewable energy sources act also supports builders seeking to make use of regenerative raw materials – i.e , installing a boilers that use scrap-wood pellets instead of oil .

according to the german environment ministry , renewable energies are responsible for around 2.9 per cent of the total energy provision in germany today .
the stated aim is to double the share of renewables in the energy supply to 4.2 percent by 2010 , from its level of 2.1 percent in 2000 , and the share in gross electricity consumption from 6.3 % in 2000 to 12.5 % in 2010 .

in cuba , mass rallies have been organised against the new measures .
the cuban government , which itself prevents its people travelling unless with special permission , says president bush 's policy is brutal and cruel .

key wto members accepted proposals to cut the subsidies wealthy countries give their farmers for exports .
the deal should reduce barriers to international trade and so , it is hoped , lift millions out of poverty .
brazil 's foreign minister , celso amorim , said the wto agreement was good for trade and good for social justice .
" this is the beginning of the end for -lsb- farm -rsb- subsidies .
export subsidies will be eliminated first , " he said .
the agreement , agreed late on saturday in geneva , puts the so-called doha round of trade talks back on track , after similar talks in cancun last september ended in deadlock .
the geneva talks were extended for an extra 24 hours after the 147 wto members failed to reach an agreement by the end of friday , the original deadline .
hammered out " today 's news is that the doha round is back on track , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said .
analysis : much work ahead " in cancun i said the round was in intensive care .
today it 's not only out of the hospital but well and running , " he added .
us trade representative robert zoellick said the deal was " a crucial step for world trade " .
but even with the latest agreement , the details will still have to be hammered out , and that could take at least another couple of years , says the bbc 's john moylan in geneva .
a small group of african countries claimed a major breakthrough on their key agricultural product of cotton , our correspondent says .
after hours of talks , key wto nations , including the us , the eu , brazil and japan , agreed to eliminate export subsidies at a date to be set , to limit other subsidies and lower tariff barriers .
in return , wealthier nations , among them the eu 's members , are insisting on better access to markets in developing nations .
france , the biggest beneficiary of eu agricultural subsidies , has been highly critical of moves to cut support for farmers .
but eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler said the eu could " broadly accept " the deal .
japan and switzerland were also concerned about the removal of subsidies for some of their agricultural producers .
key points farm export subsidies eliminated - but timeframe has yet to be set stricter rules on state aid for rural development developing countries to cut import tariffs for industrial goods customs procedures to be simplified " the liberalization process will put additional economic pressure on our farmers , " said swiss president and economics minister joseph deiss .
but he welcomed the plan nonetheless : " this will be a key step for the opening of the world economy and this will be of benefit for all countries . "
healing the rift the geneva agreement revives the long-stalled talks on a trade liberalisation treaty that began in doha in 2001 but which collapsed amid a bitter rift between developed and developing nations in cancun last year .
wto director general supachai panitchpakdi said the breakthrough was a historic moment for the organisation .
according to the world bank , a successful final deal could add $ 520bn -lrb- £ 280bn ; 420bn euros -rrb- to the world economy by 2015 , if rich and developing countries cut their tariffs .
most of the benefit would , the world bank believes , go to poorer countries .
analysts say it is vital that any new deal be agreed before 2007 , when what is known as fast-track legislation expires in the us .
without fast-track , which limits the power of the us congress to alter trade deals negotiated by washington , there is little prospect that the us will adopt a new pact .
eu commissioner lamy said that he now believed the doha round could be completed by the end of 2005 .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : working time directive home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : sunday , 1 august , 2004 , 07:08 gmt 08:08 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : working time directive from sunday , under the european working time directive , the number of hours junior doctors can work will be limited .
bbc news online examines the directive and what it means for uk workers .
what is the working time directive ?
the directive is a european union initiative designed to protect workers from exploitation by employers .
it lays down regulations on matters such as how many breaks employees can take , and how much holiday they are entitled to .
the directive 's headline regulation is aimed at limiting the average working time for employees in the european union to 48 hours a week .
the regulations became law in the uk in october 1998 but some groups of workers , such those working in transport and junior doctors , were exempted from the directive .
however , as far as junior doctors goes this exemption starts to be eroded from sunday .
so junior doctors will work fewer hours ?
in theory , yes , their hours will have to fall to 48 per week by 2009 , the government has said .
doctors hours should fall to 48 per week by 2009 on sunday , as a stepping stone towards the 48 hour target , nhs trusts are expected to ensure that no junior doctor work more than 58 hours .
the directive also sets new minimum rest requirements for doctors in training .
however , research by the nhs confederation indicated that as many as one in six nhs trusts did not expect to meet sunday 's deadline for a 58-hour-week .
my partner works more than 48 hours a week in an office job , is this illegal ?
probably not , as there is an opt-out clause in the directive .
the opt-out means that workers can put in more than an average working week of 48 hours if they have agreed to do so with employers .
however the " opt-out " is under attack .
ms diamantopoulou feared uk staff worked too long the tuc would like to see it go and anna diamantopoulou , a former european employment commissioner , has said uk companies could be guilty of abusing the opt-out and forcing staff to work longer hours .
unions say more than 3 million men in the uk work more than 49 hours a week , almost one in four of the male workforce .
the figure for women is far lower at about 5.5 % of the workforce , partly due to higher numbers working part-time .
but the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- denies that abuse is taking place , and the conciliation service acas has concluded that the directive is not a source of disharmony in uk industry .
is the opt-out likely to come to an end ?
the european union has consulted on whether the opt-out should remain and is likely to announce a decision on its future in late september .
the eu has outlined four options for the future of the opt-out .
phasing out of the opt-out alleged abuse by employers clamped down upon opt-out only allowed following an agreement between employers and unions or the workforce as a whole individual employees can continue to put in more than an average working week of 48 hours if they have agreed to do so with employers e-mail this to a friend printable version see also : nhs ' facing new staffing crisis ' 08 apr 04 -pipe- health eu law ' threatens nhs care ' 06 apr 04 -pipe- health sleep deprivation ' fazes junior doctors ' 24 jan 02 -pipe- health related internet links : british medical association department of health european union gateway confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories strong demand boosts intel profit rio resumes australia investment unemployment dips to 2.47 million products and services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health have your say -pipe- in pictures -pipe- week at a glance -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes bbc copyright notice mmxi most popular now -pipe- 55,843 pages were read in the last minute .

bbc news online examines the directive and what it means for uk workers .
what is the working time directive ?
the directive is a european union initiative designed to protect workers from exploitation by employers .
it lays down regulations on matters such as how many breaks employees can take , and how much holiday they are entitled to .
the directive 's headline regulation is aimed at limiting the average working time for employees in the european union to 48 hours a week .
the regulations became law in the uk in october 1998 but some groups of workers , such those working in transport and junior doctors , were exempted from the directive .
however , as far as junior doctors goes this exemption starts to be eroded from sunday .
so junior doctors will work fewer hours ?
in theory , yes , their hours will have to fall to 48 per week by 2009 , the government has said .
doctors hours should fall to 48 per week by 2009 on sunday , as a stepping stone towards the 48 hour target , nhs trusts are expected to ensure that no junior doctor work more than 58 hours .
the directive also sets new minimum rest requirements for doctors in training .
however , research by the nhs confederation indicated that as many as one in six nhs trusts did not expect to meet sunday 's deadline for a 58-hour-week .
my partner works more than 48 hours a week in an office job , is this illegal ?
probably not , as there is an opt-out clause in the directive .
the opt-out means that workers can put in more than an average working week of 48 hours if they have agreed to do so with employers .
however the " opt-out " is under attack .
ms diamantopoulou feared uk staff worked too long the tuc would like to see it go and anna diamantopoulou , a former european employment commissioner , has said uk companies could be guilty of abusing the opt-out and forcing staff to work longer hours .
unions say more than 3 million men in the uk work more than 49 hours a week , almost one in four of the male workforce .
the figure for women is far lower at about 5.5 % of the workforce , partly due to higher numbers working part-time .
but the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- denies that abuse is taking place , and the conciliation service acas has concluded that the directive is not a source of disharmony in uk industry .
is the opt-out likely to come to an end ?
the european union has consulted on whether the opt-out should remain and is likely to announce a decision on its future in late september .
the eu has outlined four options for the future of the opt-out .
phasing out of the opt-out alleged abuse by employers clamped down upon opt-out only allowed following an agreement between employers and unions or the workforce as a whole individual employees can continue to put in more than an average working week of 48 hours if they have agreed to do so with employers e-mail this to a friend printable version see also : nhs ' facing new staffing crisis ' 08 apr 04 -pipe- health eu law ' threatens nhs care ' 06 apr 04 -pipe- health sleep deprivation ' fazes junior doctors ' 24 jan 02 -pipe- health related internet links : british medical association department of health european union gateway confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories strong demand boosts intel profit rio resumes australia investment unemployment dips to 2.47 million products and services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health have your say -pipe- in pictures -pipe- week at a glance -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes bbc copyright notice mmx most popular now -pipe- 80,857 pages were read in the last minute .
