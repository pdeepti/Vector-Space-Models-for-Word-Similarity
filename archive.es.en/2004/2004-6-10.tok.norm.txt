program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.
the rigid and anachronistic maxim “ i ’ ll never work on sunday ” won ’ t last forever , the lübeck paper said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.
the rigid and anachronistic maxim “ i ’ ll never work on sunday ” won ’ t last forever , the lübeck paper said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.06.2004 the view from the summit one could almost envy the leaders of the eight biggest industrialized countries , the members of the so-called g-8 states .
this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .
in this collection of articles , dw-world provides background information on the g-8 , its history , its goals and its opponents along with current analysis and commentary . dw-world.de g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- what is the g-8 ?
the group of eight is comprised of the leading industrial nations canada , france , germany , great britain , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- a platform for protest in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- from bit player to global heavyweight the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- china : the uninvited guest the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .
-lrb- june 9 , 2004 -rrb- g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform g-8 leaders were all smiles at their summit on wednesday .
but despite all the public bonhomie , the europeans remained reluctant towards u.s. president bush 's plans to reform the middle east and get nato involved in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : european parliament elections 2004 the new europe glossary : the european union from a-z european constitution politics from the left europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joan collins finds it hard to talk to other europeans elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .
in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.06.2004 the view from the summit one could almost envy the leaders of the eight biggest industrialized countries , the members of the so-called g-8 states .
this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .
in this collection of articles , dw-world provides background information on the g-8 , its history , its goals and its opponents along with current analysis and commentary . dw-world.de g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.

this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .

more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?

this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .
in this collection of articles , dw-world provides background information on the g-8 , its history , its goals and its opponents along with current analysis and commentary . dw-world.de g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids .

the group of eight is comprised of the leading industrial nations canada , france , germany , great britain , italy , japan , russia and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.
the rigid and anachronistic maxim “ i ’ ll never work on sunday ” won ’ t last forever , the lübeck paper said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .
-lrb- june 9 , 2004 -rrb- german teens sentenced for abusing classmate three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences .

the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.
the rigid and anachronistic maxim “ i ’ ll never work on sunday ” won ’ t last forever , the lübeck paper said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer . in hildesheim , germany , a court condemned nine young men to sentences ranging from probation to 18 months in prison for ritually abusing a peer for over three months .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung from essen called the teens swines .
they took a 16-year old , tormented and humiliated him .
the main culprits have received juvenile sentences that only require them to spend their nights in a correctional facility .
during the day , they can pursue job training .
the paper wrote that they have a last chance to save themselves .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .
rather than pleading for stricter laws against neglected adolescents , the coburg daily said parents and other adults should look at themselves in the mirror since they are the ones who failed . the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest legal instance , has put the ball back in the government ’ s court , wrote berlin ’ s die welt .
the laws restricting shop hours were deemed constitutional , and the judges in karlsruhe suggested that the question is one for the state governments .
the daily said that regional legislatures should deal with the matter , not the seemingly overburdened federal government .
but they should be so kind as to do so before the end of this century .
it is embarrassing enough that the world laughs about our shop hours .
but who can take germany seriously when a rampantly growing bureaucracy is messing about with shoppers , the paper asked . the center-left governing coalition pulled the short straw with the shop hour verdict wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the most comfortable solution for berlin would have been if the constitutional court had ruled that the legislation on store hours must be changed , no matter in what form .
now , the cologne paper observed , the federal government has to act and allow the individual states to develop fundamentally new concepts with regards to shopping hours . yes , the government can dictate store hours , but it doesn ’ t have to , the financial times deutschland wrote .
the law has de facto already been more or less liberalized .
gas stations and train station shops sell almost everything under the sun by calling them travel items .
the disadvantages to other shops are obvious as well as unjustified , wrote the hamburg financial daily .
the states would be well-advised to scrap the remnants of the shop hours law and leave the decision to department stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
towns and villages could preserve the current laws that require businesses to be closed on sunday and holidays .
of course , the paper noted , workers will howl about the extra flexibility demanded of them , but if they work in a service-oriented business , they should keep the saying in mind that the customer is king . the lübecker nachrichten wrote that salespeople across germany have reason to be happy , since at least one free day will be reserved for them .
but who knows how much longer it will last ?
individual states will eventually allow stores to stay open past 8 p.m.
the rigid and anachronistic maxim “ i ’ ll never work on sunday ” won ’ t last forever , the lübeck paper said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high court rejects liberalizing store hours germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : european parliament elections 2004 the new europe glossary : the european union from a-z european constitution politics from the left europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joan collins finds it hard to talk to other europeans elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .
in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.06.2004 the view from the summit one could almost envy the leaders of the eight biggest industrialized countries , the members of the so-called g-8 states .
this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .
in this collection of articles , dw-world provides background information on the g-8 , its history , its goals and its opponents along with current analysis and commentary . dw-world.de g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- what is the g-8 ?
the group of eight is comprised of the leading industrial nations canada , france , germany , great britain , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- a platform for protest in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- from bit player to global heavyweight the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- china : the uninvited guest the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .
-lrb- june 9 , 2004 -rrb- g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform g-8 leaders were all smiles at their summit on wednesday .
but despite all the public bonhomie , the europeans remained reluctant towards u.s. president bush 's plans to reform the middle east and get nato involved in iraq .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .
european officials like foreign policy chief javier solana make regular visits to kosovo .
the united nations interim mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- gives brussels regular reports .
in april , the german parliament agreed to extend the mandate of the 3,670 troops taking part in the nato peacekeeping mission , the largest contribution from any single country . of the € 35 billion invested in the balkan region in the last five years , € 6.3 billion has gone through the eu-sponsored stability pact for southeastern europe .
on recent trips , solana has urged kosovo to take more responsibility for its economic future . since the end of the fighting in 1999 , the european union has helped set up 100 banks , helped switched the currency over to the euro and introduced new business laws .
but pack said hurdles remain . " privatization is being held up , " said pack , among other reasons because matters of ownership have yet to be cleared up .
" and the ability of the two sides to live together is still up in the air , " he said . nowhere was that more clear than in the recent clashes in the capital , pristina .
the sudden violence was proof that the local international bodies do not have as good a handle on the situation as they might have thought . solana responded by appointing an eu representative to kosovo who will be on the lookout for future such blow-ups . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.06.2004 the view from the summit one could almost envy the leaders of the eight biggest industrialized countries , the members of the so-called g-8 states .
this year 's world economic summit takes place in the sub-tropical paradise of sea island , an eight-kilometer long island off the coast of georgia full of noble villas and golf courses .
but the heads of state and government will have little time to enjoy the luxury .
from june 8 to 10 , they will be focused on negotiating a tough political agenda covering the current situation in iraq , the peace process in the middle east and the continuing high price of oil .
the location of this year 's summit follows the trend set in previous years of staging the high-profile meeting in secluded sites removed from mass protests by globalization critics .
with such hot-button issues on the table , the two-day conference is nonetheless bound to attract demonstrators and generate a good deal of criticism .
in this collection of articles , dw-world provides background information on the g-8 , its history , its goals and its opponents along with current analysis and commentary . dw-world.de g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- what is the g-8 ?
the group of eight is comprised of the leading industrial nations canada , france , germany , great britain , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
although informal in structure , the group 's influence is far reaching .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- a platform for protest in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows .
-lrb- june 7 , 2004 -rrb- from bit player to global heavyweight the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- china : the uninvited guest the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy .
-lrb- june 8 , 2004 -rrb- germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again .
-lrb- june 9 , 2004 -rrb- g-8 summit ends with emphasis on mid east reform g-8 leaders were all smiles at their summit on wednesday .
but despite all the public bonhomie , the europeans remained reluctant towards u.s. president bush 's plans to reform the middle east and get nato involved in iraq .

five years ago , united nations troops marched into kosovo , ending the last of the balkan wars in the 1990s .
though democratic progress has been made , recent violence has shown the peace is tenuous . the images could have come from television footage from the late 1990s . in mid-march , pictures of burning serbian churches and clashes between ethnic albanians and the serb minority in kosovo were beamed around the world once again .
more than 19 people died in the unrest , and nato rushed to send more troops to stock up the kfor international peacekeeping force . the flare-up was a reminder of how tenuous the peace won in kosovo five years ago on june 10 has been .
in 1998 , serb paramilitary troops battled ethnic albanian kosovars , who demanded independence from serbia .
the spiraling conflict eventually resulted in bombing attacks on serbian targets by nato planes . the subsequent peace agreement between the two sides led a majority of the serb population in kosovo to leave .
today there are 1.8 million ethnic albanians in kosovo and only about 100,000 serbs . economy not yet on track the tensions between the serb minority in the region and ethnic albanians remain on simmer .
despite the best efforts of the u.n. and the eu , much of the kosovar economy remains in the hands of mobsters . " i think there has been progress in the political area .
we have had local elections , we have a government and a parliament .
in other areas there has been little progress , " said german european parliamentarian doris pack . the european community seems interested in seeing the area flourish .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty .

the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england .

collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone .

" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

the neue ruhr / neue rhein zeitung said it was hopeful that the apologies the young men made to their victim during the trial were sincere and merely uttered on the advice of their lawyers . the coburger tageblatt wrote that the verdict was harsh but correct .
it pointed out that another trial just began in which a group of teenagers , the youngest one being 12 , killed a homeless man .

thursday morning a flood of spam was released on the internet containing german-language right-wing propaganda .
experts say extremists are using a " spambot " to spread their xenophobic messages as widely as possible . one of the messages that hit e-mail boxes warned of increasing numbers of immigrants from turkey and belarus settling in a town in the state of north rhein-westphalia , saying they were driving criminality up and entering into " mixed " relationships with german women . " here in germany , i feel like a stranger in my own country , " it read . another blamed the rising cost of medical care in germany on foreigners who come to the country as " medical tourists " to get free health care .
others were entitled " what germany needs is more german children " and " the deformation of social order . " below the bodies of the right-wing messages in the spam flood , many e-mail featured a series of links that led to sites like the extreme right german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , articles that appeared in the right-oriented newspaper " young freedom , " and various " people 's initiatives " which fight such things as the building of mosques in germany . these kinds of right-wing messages are nothing new , they can be found in various extreme-right publications at newsstands . what is new is the method of their distribution - by spam , or junk e-mail .
while most spam , which by current estimates comprises between 60 to 80 percent of e-mail traffic , tries to sells goods from penis enlargement methods to viagra to college degrees , this latest spam wave simply attempts to spread a right-wing message of xenophobia to as large a group as possible . new sophistication the spam flood also shows a new it sophistication on the part of right-wing groups , since they appear to have used a " spambot , " a program spammers use to collect e-mail addresses and hide the real address of the sender , making it hard to trace the origin of the offending spam . right-wing groups have used the electronic medium to spread their messages in the past .
currently there are several e-mail newsletters in circulation informing an often unwilling public over the latest out of " germania . " but these unwelcome e-mails been easy to filter with a few clicks of the mouse to stop any future e-mails originating from a certain address .

others came from large networks owned by deutsche telekom , several originated in other countries . analysts say the right-wing spammers used the latest methods , perhaps even working in tandem with virus programmers , to " seize " other computers and use addresses found there to building large distribution lists . tracing the originators can be difficult in these cases , although the network administrator at the university of rostock told der spiegel that they have taken the server where many of the e-mails came from offline and will work with it security experts to trace the spam back to its original source . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spammers jam german government e-mail the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .

while most spam , which by current estimates comprises between 60 to 80 percent of e-mail traffic , tries to sells goods from penis enlargement methods to viagra to college degrees , this latest spam wave simply attempts to spread a right-wing message of xenophobia to as large a group as possible . new sophistication the spam flood also shows a new it sophistication on the part of right-wing groups , since they appear to have used a " spambot , " a program spammers use to collect e-mail addresses and hide the real address of the sender , making it hard to trace the origin of the offending spam . right-wing groups have used the electronic medium to spread their messages in the past .

many of those arriving at deutsche welle had return addresses such as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , one of germany 's most respected newspapers , or hotmail.com , a widely used web-based e-mail service . the newsmagazine der spiegel reported 80 percent of the right-wing spam it received came from a server at the university of rostock , in northeastern germany .
others came from large networks owned by deutsche telekom , several originated in other countries . analysts say the right-wing spammers used the latest methods , perhaps even working in tandem with virus programmers , to " seize " other computers and use addresses found there to building large distribution lists . tracing the originators can be difficult in these cases , although the network administrator at the university of rostock told der spiegel that they have taken the server where many of the e-mails came from offline and will work with it security experts to trace the spam back to its original source . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spammers jam german government e-mail the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .

police have been unable to link terrorists to a pipe bomb attack in cologne wednesday that injured 22 people , most of them turkish .
the majority of the victims have been released from the hospital . investigators were unable to get much information out of the victims , 21 of whom were turkish and one german .
six remain in the hospital . law enforcement officials said the pipe bomb was filled with nails roughly 10 cm -lrb- 4 inches -rrb- long and exploded shortly before 4 p.m. on a busy shopping street in the mühlheim neighborhood in northeastern cologne .
the blast destroyed store fronts and nearby cars in the mostly turkish district . police said a wrecked bicycle that was found in front of a hair salon may have " played a role " in the blast .
media reports suggested the bomb might have been placed on the bike .
state prosecutors and law enforcement agents said they are being deliberately careful in looking at who might be behind the attack .
so far , local police have been responsible for most of the investigation .
had there been suspicion of terrorist involvement , agents from germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution would have taken over .
" we do n't have any knowledge about the motive or suspects , " dieter klinger , the head of the investigative team , told reporters . security sources have said the police investigation into the bombing was focusing on organized crime .
german interior minister otto schilly said it was too early to draw a conclusion about a possible motive . " the findings made so far by our intelligence authorities point not to a terrorist background , but to a criminal milieu , " he said . police have assigned a relatively small force of 20 officers to investigate the attack , which indicates they do not believe terrorism is involved . the blast occurred in the street in front of a three-story building containing both apartments and businesses and caused an estimated € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,758 -rrb- in damage.most of the injured had been in a pizza restaurant on the ground floor , according to a fire department spokesman . dw staff -lrb- dre and jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

state prosecutors and law enforcement agents said they are being deliberately careful in looking at who might be behind the attack .
so far , local police have been responsible for most of the investigation .
had there been suspicion of terrorist involvement , agents from germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution would have taken over .
" we do n't have any knowledge about the motive or suspects , " dieter klinger , the head of the investigative team , told reporters . security sources have said the police investigation into the bombing was focusing on organized crime .
german interior minister otto schilly said it was too early to draw a conclusion about a possible motive . " the findings made so far by our intelligence authorities point not to a terrorist background , but to a criminal milieu , " he said . police have assigned a relatively small force of 20 officers to investigate the attack , which indicates they do not believe terrorism is involved . the blast occurred in the street in front of a three-story building containing both apartments and businesses and caused an estimated € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,758 -rrb- in damage.most of the injured had been in a pizza restaurant on the ground floor , according to a fire department spokesman . dw staff -lrb- dre and jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : european parliament elections 2004 the new europe glossary : the european union from a-z european constitution politics from the left europe -pipe- 10.06.2004 eu-skeptics gain momentum in britain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joan collins finds it hard to talk to other europeans elections for the european parliament started thursday as dutch and british voters headed to the polls .
in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

thursday morning a flood of spam was released on the internet containing german-language right-wing propaganda .
experts say extremists are using a " spambot " to spread their xenophobic messages as widely as possible . one of the messages that hit e-mail boxes warned of increasing numbers of immigrants from turkey and belarus settling in a town in the state of north rhein-westphalia , saying they were driving criminality up and entering into " mixed " relationships with german women . " here in germany , i feel like a stranger in my own country , " it read . another blamed the rising cost of medical care in germany on foreigners who come to the country as " medical tourists " to get free health care .
others were entitled " what germany needs is more german children " and " the deformation of social order . " below the bodies of the right-wing messages in the spam flood , many e-mail featured a series of links that led to sites like the extreme right german national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , articles that appeared in the right-oriented newspaper " young freedom , " and various " people 's initiatives " which fight such things as the building of mosques in germany . these kinds of right-wing messages are nothing new , they can be found in various extreme-right publications at newsstands . what is new is the method of their distribution - by spam , or junk e-mail .
while most spam , which by current estimates comprises between 60 to 80 percent of e-mail traffic , tries to sells goods from penis enlargement methods to viagra to college degrees , this latest spam wave simply attempts to spread a right-wing message of xenophobia to as large a group as possible . new sophistication the spam flood also shows a new it sophistication on the part of right-wing groups , since they appear to have used a " spambot , " a program spammers use to collect e-mail addresses and hide the real address of the sender , making it hard to trace the origin of the offending spam . right-wing groups have used the electronic medium to spread their messages in the past .
currently there are several e-mail newsletters in circulation informing an often unwilling public over the latest out of " germania . " but these unwelcome e-mails been easy to filter with a few clicks of the mouse to stop any future e-mails originating from a certain address .
this latest wave of spam is different . the mails come from different addresses .
many of those arriving at deutsche welle had return addresses such as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , one of germany 's most respected newspapers , or hotmail.com , a widely used web-based e-mail service . the newsmagazine der spiegel reported 80 percent of the right-wing spam it received came from a server at the university of rostock , in northeastern germany .
others came from large networks owned by deutsche telekom , several originated in other countries . analysts say the right-wing spammers used the latest methods , perhaps even working in tandem with virus programmers , to " seize " other computers and use addresses found there to building large distribution lists . tracing the originators can be difficult in these cases , although the network administrator at the university of rostock told der spiegel that they have taken the server where many of the e-mails came from offline and will work with it security experts to trace the spam back to its original source . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spammers jam german government e-mail the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .
the amount of junk and virus-infected mail has posed an ever growing problem to both governments and european businesses .

in britain , an anti-eu party with celebrity backing could do particularly well . nearly 349 million people across the eu are eligible to elect a new parliament through sunday .
according to some opinion polls , the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- could get as much as 18 percent of the british vote , which would make the right-wing party the third strongest british group in the eu parliament .
currently , three members of the european parliament belong to the ukip . in the weeks and months leading up to the election , clever pr and support from conservative tabloids pushed the ukip from an outsider position to the center of media attention .
in addition , the party 's top candidate , robert kilroy-silk , hosted a tv talk show until he called arabs " suicide bombers , limb amputators -lrb- and -rrb- women repressors " and was fired from his position . kilroy-silk has promised voters to end alleged eu paternalism .
" my father did not give his life in the war that we should be governed by chirac and schröder , by france and germany , " he said at a press conference . soap opera glamour ukip officials have also managed to get glamorous support from joan collins , best known as the scheming alexis carrington in the u.s. tv soap opera " dynasty . "
the 71-year-old actress , who has admittedly never voted in her life , went as far as accusing eu bureaucrats of wanting to " kill my england . " collins lives in southern france and follows in the footsteps of french actress bridget bardot , who has voiced her support for france 's extreme right-wing national front party in the past .
collins reportedly also said she did n't know what to talk about during dinner conversations with slovaks , slovenes or estonians after chit-chatting about the weather . imploding the system from within the party 's platform can be summed up quickly : no to an eu constitution .
no to joining the euro .
and no to eu membership in general .
ukip officials have put quotation marks around eu parliament in their brochures as they do n't believe the legislature is a necessary body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk during a press conference in may .
kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- still wants to go to strasbourg and brussels , where the parliament holds its sessions : he wants to help implode the system from within and return to a loosely associated free trade zone . " we know that many parliamentarians of the new eu member states do n't support a superstate but a free trade zone , " kilroy told reporters .
" they sympathize with america and we agree with them .
we will form a larger group of euro-skeptics in the european parliament .
a lot will change . " some british observers see the ukip as a catchment basin for nationalists , racists and opponents of asylum-seekers .
but even the governing labour party , which is expected to take a beating in the elections , has somewhat taken up the general anti-eu trend : during negotiations for an eu constitution , british foreign secretary jack straw keeps talking about red lines that have to be drawn to preserve britain 's independence and he promised not to sacrifice britain on the altar of europe . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 click here to read dw-world 's complete coverage of the european parliamentary elections feedback do you think the ukip should be taken as a serious threat to the future of the eu ?

police have been unable to link terrorists to a pipe bomb attack in cologne wednesday that injured 22 people , most of them turkish .
the majority of the victims have been released from the hospital . investigators were unable to get much information out of the victims , 21 of whom were turkish and one german .
six remain in the hospital . law enforcement officials said the pipe bomb was filled with nails roughly 10 cm -lrb- 4 inches -rrb- long and exploded shortly before 4 p.m. on a busy shopping street in the mühlheim neighborhood in northeastern cologne .
the blast destroyed store fronts and nearby cars in the mostly turkish district . police said a wrecked bicycle that was found in front of a hair salon may have " played a role " in the blast .
media reports suggested the bomb might have been placed on the bike .
state prosecutors and law enforcement agents said they are being deliberately careful in looking at who might be behind the attack .
so far , local police have been responsible for most of the investigation .
had there been suspicion of terrorist involvement , agents from germany 's federal office for the protection of the constitution would have taken over .
" we do n't have any knowledge about the motive or suspects , " dieter klinger , the head of the investigative team , told reporters . security sources have said the police investigation into the bombing was focusing on organized crime .
german interior minister otto schilly said it was too early to draw a conclusion about a possible motive . " the findings made so far by our intelligence authorities point not to a terrorist background , but to a criminal milieu , " he said . police have assigned a relatively small force of 20 officers to investigate the attack , which indicates they do not believe terrorism is involved . the blast occurred in the street in front of a three-story building containing both apartments and businesses and caused an estimated € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,758 -rrb- in damage.most of the injured had been in a pizza restaurant on the ground floor , according to a fire department spokesman . dw staff -lrb- dre and jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the closure , which will affect 700 employees , is part of a major restructuring of the company 's rail division that will cut around 6,600 jobs - 1,500 of them in germany - and shut down seven production plants across europe .
the closing down of the ammendorf plant will deal a blow to the state of saxony-anhalt , which has the highest unemployment rate - close to 20 percent - in germany .
in 2002 , bombardier decided against closing ammendorf when chancellor gerhard schröder personally intervened and held talks with the company .
the government stepped in with a large order from a state transport authority . but on wednesday , the board chairman of its german arm , peter witt , said bombardier has now decided to close the facility by december 2005 . more briefs 10.06.2004 -pipe- volkswagen to be official sponsor of 2008 olympics 09.06.2004 -pipe- french pm joins simmering siemens row 09.06.2004 -pipe- judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms 09.06.2004 -pipe- german exports and imports increase in april 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling 08.06.2004 -pipe- bundesbank : lack of cents creating trouble for euro 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany mulls tax on jet fuel 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft and sap reveal failed merger talks radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the leaders , meeting in the us state of georgia , said the reforms should be accompanied by support for a settlement in the palestinian-israeli conflict .
president bush 's original plan was seen by the arab leaders as an attempt to impose american values on their region .
on thursday , the summit focus shifts to africa , discussing debt relief .
the g8 leaders also have plans to train and equip more than 50,000 peacekeepers over the next five years , particularly for deployment in africa .
us officials said the initiative had grown out of african requests for assistance in ending the civil wars plaguing the continent .
mid-east settlement the leaders of the uk , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us said that ending the palestinian-israeli conflict was a priority , but should not be used as an excuse for not seeking reform .
the summit is trying to secure a suitable exit for the us from iraq palestinian paper al-hayat al-jadidah arab press sees hope for iraq " our support for reform in the region will go hand in hand with our support for a just , comprehensive and lasting settlement to the arab-israeli conflict , " the statement said .
the bbc 's jill mcgivering in georgia says earlier drafts of the statement originating from washington made no mention of the importance of the conflict and proved highly controversial in the arab world and europe , and the inclusion will make it more palatable to critics .
and in an attempt to deflect criticism from some arab leaders , the statement noted that the reform should not and could not be imposed from outside .
main g8 issues middle east - israel / palestinian conflict and looming iraq handover are key issues .

department of health officials , senior consultants , nhs managers and patient representatives have met to discuss the issue , radio 4 's today programme says .
it says surgeons fear viable organs will be lost because no surgeon can be found to perform an operation .
reporter tom feilder says the problem is most acute in renal surgery .
potentially , there could be the effect that our transplant units are not open all the time and the possibility that organs will not be used john forsythe listen to the today programme discussion kidney transplant centres are locally managed within the nhs and hospital units tend to be small , leaving individual consultants facing long hours and unpredictable shift patterns .
and because organs must be used swiftly after they become available , this means surgeons often being called out during the night and over weekends .
one hospital in plymouth was recently forced to advertise a vacant consultant 's post three times before finding a suitable candidate .
sharp focus john forsythe , vice-president of the british transplantation society , told the today programme : " we have been aware of a problem in recruitment for some time , but it has been brought into sharp focus in the last little while because of a realisation that jobs are unfilled in some of the units in the uk .
" with increased regulation to do with hours of work , the european working time directive and the new consultant contract , this problem is going to get worse . "
dr forsythe said the society had passed a unanimous vote at its meeting on wednesday warning that the present situation was unsustainable .
" potentially , there could be the effect that our transplant units are not open all the time and the possibility that organs will not be used .
" at the moment , there 's no evidence that 's happened .
we are trying in a professional way to plan for the future before such a drastic thing occurs . "
intense demands professor peter friend , a consultant renal surgeon at the oxford transplant centre , said the demands of the job were very intense .
" kidney transplantation is part of a very exciting form of surgery , it is right on the interface between science and medicine , the patients are complex , it is a very fulfilling job .
" but there is an image problem , and it is largely due to the fact that kidney transplant surgeons are seen to be over-worked , and perhaps in some senses , under-valued . "
in a statement , the national kidney research fund agreed that the problem was serious .
it said : " the knock-on effects of a lack of transplant surgeons is a situation that can not be sustained as they are felt by the surgeons themselves , as well as the patients they care for .
" for the surgeons , their on-call hours become very onerous with some experiencing an average of four out of every seven days .
" and for the patient there is concern that the well known lack of organs , coupled with the lack of transplant surgeons , does not help to improve people ¿ s chances of having a transplant . "
doctors ' representatives are calling for : more money for transplant specialists who have to work unpredictable hours the merging of small transplant units into larger centres to allow greater flexibility with rotas increased exposure of junior doctors to transplantation at a time when they are making their career choices a department of health spokesman said : " it is recognised that recruiting transplant surgeons is difficult , as transplantation surgery is often perceived as difficult , with a heavy out-of-hours commitment .
" there have been a number of initiatives to increase the number of transplant surgeons in training which , to date , have had limited success . "

department of health officials , senior consultants , nhs managers and patient representatives have met to discuss the issue , radio 4 's today programme says .
it says surgeons fear viable organs will be lost because no surgeon can be found to perform an operation .
reporter tom feilder says the problem is most acute in renal surgery . "
potentially , there could be the effect that our transplant units are not open all the time and the possibility that organs will not be used " john forsythe kidney transplant centres are locally managed within the nhs and hospital units tend to be small , leaving individual consultants facing long hours and unpredictable shift patterns .
and because organs must be used swiftly after they become available , this means surgeons often being called out during the night and over weekends .
one hospital in plymouth was recently forced to advertise a vacant consultant 's post three times before finding a suitable candidate .
sharp focus john forsythe , vice-president of the british transplantation society , told the today programme : " we have been aware of a problem in recruitment for some time , but it has been brought into sharp focus in the last little while because of a realisation that jobs are unfilled in some of the units in the uk .
" with increased regulation to do with hours of work , the european working time directive and the new consultant contract , this problem is going to get worse . "
dr forsythe said the society had passed a unanimous vote at its meeting on wednesday warning that the present situation was unsustainable .
" potentially , there could be the effect that our transplant units are not open all the time and the possibility that organs will not be used .
" at the moment , there 's no evidence that 's happened .
we are trying in a professional way to plan for the future before such a drastic thing occurs . "
intense demands professor peter friend , a consultant renal surgeon at the oxford transplant centre , said the demands of the job were very intense .
" kidney transplantation is part of a very exciting form of surgery , it is right on the interface between science and medicine , the patients are complex , it is a very fulfilling job .
" but there is an image problem , and it is largely due to the fact that kidney transplant surgeons are seen to be over-worked , and perhaps in some senses , under-valued . "
in a statement , the national kidney research fund agreed that the problem was serious .
it said : " the knock-on effects of a lack of transplant surgeons is a situation that can not be sustained as they are felt by the surgeons themselves , as well as the patients they care for .
" for the surgeons , their on-call hours become very onerous with some experiencing an average of four out of every seven days .
" and for the patient there is concern that the well known lack of organs , coupled with the lack of transplant surgeons , does not help to improve people ¿ s chances of having a transplant . "
doctors ' representatives are calling for : more money for transplant specialists who have to work unpredictable hours the merging of small transplant units into larger centres to allow greater flexibility with rotas increased exposure of junior doctors to transplantation at a time when they are making their career choices a department of health spokesman said : " it is recognised that recruiting transplant surgeons is difficult , as transplantation surgery is often perceived as difficult , with a heavy out-of-hours commitment .
" there have been a number of initiatives to increase the number of transplant surgeons in training which , to date , have had limited success . "
the spokesman said several initiatives were currently underway to try to maximise the donation of organs , and to increase the kidney transplant rate .
" this will produce more choice for patients but , as importantly , a successful and thriving transplant service will be attractive to more surgeons . "

breakfast asked residents in nottingham it might not have been quite so controversial if it had n't come out of the mouth of the secretary of state for health .
instead , it seems , dr john reid may have undone years of health campaigning .
he let slip that he understood that having a cigarette might be one of the few pleasures in life - especially if you 're poor , living in bad housing and looking after children on your own .
he 's been accused of sending out mixed messages after telling one of labour 's " big conversation " groups that smoking is n't the biggest problem affecting the poor .
plain speaking or patronising ?
jump straight to our e-mail form to tell breakfast what you think of dr reid 's comments dismissing smoking campaigns as an obsession of the middle classes , dr john reid added : " what enjoyment does a 21-year-old single mother-of-three living in a council sink estate get ?
" the only enjoyment sometimes they have is to have a cigarette . "
this morning , breakfast set out to find out whether he 's right .
we sent our reporter mike sergeant to a council estate in nottingham , to find out what people there think .
many agreed with john reid 's comments : they enjoy smoking , even though they know it 's not good for them. watch mike sergeant 's report from nottingham and we debated the issue of smoking and poverty with professor carol black , president of the royal college of physicians and robert whelan , the deputy director of the think-tank civitas. watch breakfast 's debate on smoking and poverty we also want to know what you think .

a report in health service journal says the government will demand cuts in waiting times and hospital admissions in return for the extra cash .
it claims ministers also want cuts in child obesity and smoking rates .
the government has refused to comment on the report , saying no decision has been made .
but the hsj said the targets would be announced in july .
according to the magazine , the targets will be published at the same time as the results of the government 's comprehensive spending review , which will set out spending priorities for the next three years .
extra money chancellor gordon brown has previously pledged to increase spending on the nhs at least until 2008 .
in four years time , spending on the nhs is expected to top £ 100bn a year .
this compares to £ 79bn this year . "
no targets have yet been signed off by ministers " spokesman , department of health the hsj says it has seen a final draft of an agreement between the treasury and the department of health , which will be published when the comprehensive spending review is announced .
it says the document includes tough new targets on waiting times and on public health .
the magazine says the treasury will demand that all patients can start treatment within four-and-a-half months of being referred by a gp by 2008 .
it will also call for a 10 % cut in the number of people admitted to hospital as emergencies .
the document suggests this could be achieved by improving the care given to patients with chronic diseases .
the magazine says the treasury also wants the annual increase in child obesity rates to have been stopped by 2010 .
in addition , it is calling for adult smoking rates to be reduced to 21 % of the population by 2010 .
at the moment , the target is 24 % .
the document also includes targets to increase average life expectancy for men by three years and for women by 2.5 years by 2010 , according to the magazine .
however , a spokesman for the department of health said a final decision had still to be made .
" we do n't comment on leaked documents .
no targets have yet been signed off by ministers , " he said .
medical support professor sian griffiths , president of the faculty of public health , said she would back a target to cut obesity rates .
" this is the sort of bold statement that we really need to reverse what is an epidemic-style curve , " she told the hsj .
dr michael dixon , chairman of the nhs alliance which represents primary care organisations , also backed the idea .
" it is good to see that these targets are looking at the things that really matter . "
however , opposition parties were critical .
shadow health secretary tim yeo said : " labour is continuing to set targets despite evidence from nhs staff that they distort priorities . "
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " these targets show that the government can not let go of its obsession with micromanaging the nhs . "

the government wants to switch off analogue broadcasts by 2010 until now , satellite tv has meant pay tv .
sky viewers pay a monthly subscription to watch its services , a development that has revolutionised television in this country in the last decade .
a whole new revenue stream was brought into british television , complementing the bbc 's licence fee and the advertising that funds itv and other free-to-air commercial channels .
with seven million homes paying up to £ 400 a year in subscription and other charges , bskyb became the most profitable of british broadcasters .
now sky has changed its policy .
later this year , it will offer 200 tv , radio and interactive services free-to-air , for a one-off payment of £ 150 .
that includes the cost of a satellite dish , a set-top receiver box and installation by sky engineers .
sky will not make much money on the free service - but it hopes many of the new customers will later upgrade to the pay channels .
so why has it made the change ?
the move was prompted partly by a slow-down in new satellite subscribers .
there 's been evidence for some time that sky 's subscriber growth had plateaued .
those households that wanted - and could afford - the sport and movie channels , or the music and children 's channels , had already got sky .
those that were left either did not want to pay or did not want a dish on their house .
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option the success of freeview was another factor .
the free digital terrestrial service , which rose from the ashes of the itv digital pay service , showed that many people wanted more channels but were not prepared to pay a subscription .
the simple concept of a one-off payment for a box you could plug into your existing tv and aerial has proved remarkably attractive .
more than 3.5 million boxes have been sold .
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option .
but equally significant has been the government 's desire to switch everyone over to digital broadcasting in the next few years .
the freeview service , which uses ordinary tv aerials , can not be received in a quarter of uk homes .
the satellite signal can be picked up everywhere ... provided people are willing - and can afford - to install a dish .
the bbc 's own view -lsb- is -rsb- that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw andy duncan bbc director of marketing , communications & audiences ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , recently called for better access to free digital satellite broadcasts in order to speed up the move to digital switchover .
it said it might even have to consider whether it should intervene to secure a viable free-to-air satellite service .
now it does not need to andy duncan , the bbc 's director of marketing , communications and audiences , said the move followed " the bbc 's own view that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw to achieving a fully digital britain " .
he said it also meant more viewers would have access to the bbc 's new digital services without having to pay for the subscription channels : " this is good news for our viewers as it provides another route to all the bbc 's digital services without subscription . "
so will it attract many customers ?
and how will it affect freeview sales ?
the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television sky viewers already have access to many free-to-air channels , such as those of the bbc , itv and channels 4 and 5 .
they have also discovered lots of free radio channels , in high quality , which is why around a quarter of all radio listeners now claim to have listened to a station through their tv set .
now those channels will be available to those people not willing to pay a subscription .
it seems an attractive proposition , with many more tv and radio channels - and greater interactivity - than freeview .
sky says it will be offering 115 free tv channels -lrb- including all the regional variations of the bbc -rrb- and 81 radio networks , compared with freeview 's 26 tv channels and 21 radio stations .
sky 's free channels will include the five terrestrial channels , bbc digital channels such as bbc three , bbc four , cbeebies , cbbc and news 24 , as well sky news , the itv news channel and cnn .
it also includes more esoteric stations like the god channel and exchange and mart tv .
but it does not include itv2 , e4 or those satellite channels that are part of a sky subscription package .
greater choice sky 's price - £ 150 - is comparable with that of the top-of-the-range freeview boxes , though a perfectly good freeview box can be bought for around half that price .
and as more people get used to a greater choice of channels , many households may choose both , with the sky system in the main living room and freeview in the kitchen or a bedroom .
in fact , sky and the bbc have an interest in both systems .
they are both shareholders in freeview , while the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television .
the big question is how far the new service will boost the overall penetration of digital television , bringing the government closer to achieving its ambition of full digital switchover by 2010 .

the government wants to switch off analogue broadcasts by 2010 until now , satellite tv has meant pay tv .
sky viewers pay a monthly subscription to watch its services , a development that has revolutionised television in this country in the last decade .
a whole new revenue stream was brought into british television , complementing the bbc 's licence fee and the advertising that funds itv and other free-to-air commercial channels .
with seven million homes paying up to £ 400 a year in subscription and other charges , bskyb became the most profitable of british broadcasters .
now sky has changed its policy .
later this year , it will offer 200 tv , radio and interactive services free-to-air , for a one-off payment of £ 150 .
that includes the cost of a satellite dish , a set-top receiver box and installation by sky engineers .
sky will not make much money on the free service - but it hopes many of the new customers will later upgrade to the pay channels .
so why has it made the change ?
the move was prompted partly by a slow-down in new satellite subscribers .
there 's been evidence for some time that sky 's subscriber growth had plateaued .
those households that wanted - and could afford - the sport and movie channels , or the music and children 's channels , had already got sky .
those that were left either did not want to pay or did not want a dish on their house .
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option the success of freeview was another factor .
the free digital terrestrial service , which rose from the ashes of the itv digital pay service , showed that many people wanted more channels but were not prepared to pay a subscription .
the simple concept of a one-off payment for a box you could plug into your existing tv and aerial has proved remarkably attractive .
more than 3.5 million boxes have been sold .
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option .
but equally significant has been the government 's desire to switch everyone over to digital broadcasting in the next few years .
the freeview service , which uses ordinary tv aerials , can not be received in a quarter of uk homes .
the satellite signal can be picked up everywhere ... provided people are willing - and can afford - to install a dish .
the bbc 's own view -lsb- is -rsb- that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw andy duncan bbc director of marketing , communications & audiences ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , recently called for better access to free digital satellite broadcasts in order to speed up the move to digital switchover .
it said it might even have to consider whether it should intervene to secure a viable free-to-air satellite service .
now it does not need to andy duncan , the bbc 's director of marketing , communications and audiences , said the move followed " the bbc 's own view that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw to achieving a fully digital britain " .
he said it also meant more viewers would have access to the bbc 's new digital services without having to pay for the subscription channels : " this is good news for our viewers as it provides another route to all the bbc 's digital services without subscription . "
so will it attract many customers ?
and how will it affect freeview sales ?
the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television sky viewers already have access to many free-to-air channels , such as those of the bbc , itv and channels 4 and 5 .
they have also discovered lots of free radio channels , in high quality , which is why around a quarter of all radio listeners now claim to have listened to a station through their tv set .
now those channels will be available to those people not willing to pay a subscription .
it seems an attractive proposition , with many more tv and radio channels - and greater interactivity - than freeview .
sky says it will be offering 115 free tv channels -lrb- including all the regional variations of the bbc -rrb- and 81 radio networks , compared with freeview 's 26 tv channels and 21 radio stations .

the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television sky viewers already have access to many free-to-air channels , such as those of the bbc , itv and channels 4 and 5 .
they have also discovered lots of free radio channels , in high quality , which is why around a quarter of all radio listeners now claim to have listened to a station through their tv set .
now those channels will be available to those people not willing to pay a subscription .
it seems an attractive proposition , with many more tv and radio channels - and greater interactivity - than freeview .
sky says it will be offering 115 free tv channels -lrb- including all the regional variations of the bbc -rrb- and 81 radio networks , compared with freeview 's 26 tv channels and 21 radio stations .
sky 's free channels will include the five terrestrial channels , bbc digital channels such as bbc three , bbc four , cbeebies , cbbc and news 24 , as well sky news , the itv news channel and cnn .
it also includes more esoteric stations like the god channel and exchange and mart tv .
but it does not include itv2 , e4 or those satellite channels that are part of a sky subscription package .
greater choice sky 's price - £ 150 - is comparable with that of the top-of-the-range freeview boxes , though a perfectly good freeview box can be bought for around half that price .
and as more people get used to a greater choice of channels , many households may choose both , with the sky system in the main living room and freeview in the kitchen or a bedroom .
in fact , sky and the bbc have an interest in both systems .
they are both shareholders in freeview , while the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television .
the big question is how far the new service will boost the overall penetration of digital television , bringing the government closer to achieving its ambition of full digital switchover by 2010 .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- what sky 's free digital deal means bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture thursday , 10 june , 2004 , 07:16 gmt 08:16 uk what sky 's free digital deal means by torin douglas bbc media correspondent sky is to launch a new digital service with 200 tv and radio channels for a one-off payment of £ 150 - and no monthly fee .
until now , satellite tv has meant pay tv .
sky viewers pay a monthly subscription to watch its services , a development that has revolutionised television in this country in the last decade .
a whole new revenue stream was brought into british television , complementing the bbc 's licence fee and the advertising that funds itv and other free-to-air commercial channels .
with seven million homes paying up to £ 400 a year in subscription and other charges , bskyb became the most profitable of british broadcasters .
now sky has changed its policy .
later this year , it will offer 200 tv , radio and interactive services free-to-air , for a one-off payment of £ 150 .
that includes the cost of a satellite dish , a set-top receiver box and installation by sky engineers .
sky will not make much money on the free service - but it hopes many of the new customers will later upgrade to the pay channels .
so why has it made the change ?
the move was prompted partly by a slow-down in new satellite subscribers .
there 's been evidence for some time that sky 's subscriber growth had plateaued .
those households that wanted - and could afford - the sport and movie channels , or the music and children 's channels , had already got sky .
those that were left either did not want to pay or did not want a dish on their house . "
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option " the success of freeview was another factor .
the free digital terrestrial service , which rose from the ashes of the itv digital pay service , showed that many people wanted more channels but were not prepared to pay a subscription .
the simple concept of a one-off payment for a box you could plug into your existing tv and aerial has proved remarkably attractive .
more than 3.5 million boxes have been sold .
sky could no longer afford to ignore the free-to-air option .
but equally significant has been the government 's desire to switch everyone over to digital broadcasting in the next few years .
the freeview service , which uses ordinary tv aerials , can not be received in a quarter of uk homes .
the satellite signal can be picked up everywhere ... provided people are willing - and can afford - to install a dish . "
the bbc 's own view -lsb- is -rsb- that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw " andy duncan bbc director of marketing , communications & audiences ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , recently called for better access to free digital satellite broadcasts in order to speed up the move to digital switchover .
it said it might even have to consider whether it should intervene to secure a viable free-to-air satellite service .
now it does not need to andy duncan , the bbc 's director of marketing , communications and audiences , said the move followed " the bbc 's own view that free-to-air digital satellite is an important missing piece in the jigsaw to achieving a fully digital britain " .
he said it also meant more viewers would have access to the bbc 's new digital services without having to pay for the subscription channels : " this is good news for our viewers as it provides another route to all the bbc 's digital services without subscription . "
so will it attract many customers ?
and how will it affect freeview sales ? "
the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television " sky viewers already have access to many free-to-air channels , such as those of the bbc , itv and channels 4 and 5 .
they have also discovered lots of free radio channels , in high quality , which is why around a quarter of all radio listeners now claim to have listened to a station through their tv set .
now those channels will be available to those people not willing to pay a subscription .
it seems an attractive proposition , with many more tv and radio channels - and greater interactivity - than freeview .

sky 's free channels will include the five terrestrial channels , bbc digital channels such as bbc three , bbc four , cbeebies , cbbc and news 24 , as well sky news , the itv news channel and cnn .

and as more people get used to a greater choice of channels , many households may choose both , with the sky system in the main living room and freeview in the kitchen or a bedroom .
in fact , sky and the bbc have an interest in both systems .
they are both shareholders in freeview , while the bbc will benefit from its new digital channels being more widely available on satellite television .

he also explained why the count would not begin until monday .
' right results ' " the legislation requires that no results shall be announced until after the last country in europe has finished voting .
the last country in europe does not finish voting until nine o 'clock on sunday .
" that would mean we would be starting our count sometime late on sunday evening to avoid making the announcement any earlier than 9pm .
" it seems to us impracticable to try to get the hundreds of people we need to help us with all of this on a sunday night .
we think it is much better to do it on the monday morning . "
asked if it took away some of the excitement associated with elections , he said : " we are not in the business of providing excitement or not .
" we are in the business of giving the right results in the right time . "

an open-eyed look of disbelief on their faces , they shook their heads and breathed out heavily .
they both appeared very tempted to go for a few surprised swear words , but were too polite . " ... how much ? " said one of them , still stunned .
sitting in the sleek air-conditioned boardroom of one of portugal 's leading software companies , i had just told them that portugal 's seven new stadiums for euro 2004 were built for less than half the price of the new wembley national stadium in north london .
the businessman , whose headquarters is just down the road from one of the two shiny new stadiums in lisbon - estadio jose alvalade - a futuristic , curvy ground with 52,000 seats , were far from convinced england had got good value for money .
yet other experts , including uk civil engineers , say wembley is worth every penny .
so has portugal got the bargains of the century , or is wembley vastly over-priced ?
five-star stadiums the new wembley stadium , set for completion in 2006 is budgeted to cost £ 757m -lrb- $ 1.3m -rrb- , whereas the seven new stadiums across portugal , came in at a combined £ 333m .
in addition , portugal has expanded and revamped three existing stadiums for £ 73m .
the new wembley will have a few facilities the biggest new ground in portugal , the 65,000 seat estadio da luz -lrb- stadium of light -rrb- in lisbon cost £ 79m .
so are portugal 's new stadiums a bit , well , basic ?
far from it , three of them - luz , jose alvalade , and porto 's dragao have been given uefa 's top five-star rating , which means they are as good as the best stadiums across europe , and have all the bells and whistles that come with this .

taking shape against the london north skyline , it is certainly an impressive beast - 90,000 seats , a 133m tall supporting arch that at 315m long claims to be the longest single span roof structure in the world , a roof that partially retracts , and even more toilets than any other stadium in the world - 2,000 .
facilities simon inglis , the author of a number of books on football stadiums , says the vital factor to consider is that the £ 757m figure for wembley contains the entire full cost , everything from purchase of the land to the cost of the lawyers .
dragao stadium has been praised for its ' clean lines ' " they are not bad stadiums in portugal , but it is not a fair comparison , " he said .
" for a start , the £ 757m figure for wembley accounts for the cost of everything .
the figures are fully complete and totally transparent - you could do a forensic examination .
" for example , london property prices are so high , that it cost some £ 100m alone to buy the land .
" it will also be extremely well-equipped stadium .
the stadiums in portugal are better compared to english premiership grounds of the same size . "
alan crane from the institution of civil engineers also points out that the wembley figure also includes associated work such as upgrading transport links .
wage differentials " we are talking about a whole different thing , " he said .
braga stadium was cut from a mountainside mr crane said another factor in the comparison was wembley 's much bigger size .
" it is much , much cheaper to build a 50,000 capacity stadium than a 100,000 .
for every seat above 50,000 the cost increases significantly .
" there are factors most people do n't take into account , like a stadium having to be able to empty in a certain time .

far from it , three of them - luz , jose alvalade , and porto 's dragao have been given uefa 's top five-star rating , which means they are as good as the best stadiums across europe , and have all the bells and whistles that come with this .
cost head to head new wembley - £ 757m the seven new portuguese stadiums - £ 333m and while the other four new portuguese stadiums are much more modest in size , with capacities around the 30,000 mark , one of them , estadio municipal de braga , in the north portugal city of the same name , was actually carved out of a mountainside at the site of a former quarry .
cost & capacity estadio da luz , lisbon - £ 79m , 65,000 jose alvalade , lisbon - £ 52m , 52,000 dragao , porto - £ 65m , 52,000 aveiro - £ 29m , 30,000 braga - £ 55m , 30,000 bessa seculo xxi , porto - £ 30m , 30,000 algarve , faro / loule - £ 23m , 30,000 they may be smaller , but each has been given its own architectural character - there is no apparent identikit cost-cutting .
so is wembley a limited edition rolls royce , with the opulence and facilities to match ?
taking shape against the london north skyline , it is certainly an impressive beast - 90,000 seats , a 133m tall supporting arch that at 315m long claims to be the longest single span roof structure in the world , a roof that partially retracts , and even more toilets than any other stadium in the world - 2,000 .
facilities simon inglis , the author of a number of books on football stadiums , says the vital factor to consider is that the £ 757m figure for wembley contains the entire full cost , everything from purchase of the land to the cost of the lawyers .
dragao stadium has been praised for its ' clean lines ' " they are not bad stadiums in portugal , but it is not a fair comparison , " he said .
" for a start , the £ 757m figure for wembley accounts for the cost of everything .
the figures are fully complete and totally transparent - you could do a forensic examination .
" for example , london property prices are so high , that it cost some £ 100m alone to buy the land .
" it will also be extremely well-equipped stadium .
the stadiums in portugal are better compared to english premiership grounds of the same size . "
alan crane from the institution of civil engineers also points out that the wembley figure also includes associated work such as upgrading transport links .
wage differentials " we are talking about a whole different thing , " he said .
braga stadium was cut from a mountainside mr crane said another factor in the comparison was wembley 's much bigger size .
" it is much , much cheaper to build a 50,000 capacity stadium than a 100,000 .
for every seat above 50,000 the cost increases significantly .
" there are factors most people do n't take into account , like a stadium having to be able to empty in a certain time .
getting 100,000 out in 10 minutes requires expensive solutions .
" labour costs are obviously also much higher in the uk than portugal . "
but still , seven very nice stadiums for less than half the price of one .
the men at siscog software in lisbon would opt for the seven .

an open-eyed look of disbelief on their faces , they shook their heads and breathed out heavily .
they both appeared very tempted to go for a few surprised swear words , but were too polite . " ... how much ? " said one of them , still stunned .
sitting in the sleek air-conditioned boardroom of one of portugal 's leading software companies , i had just told them that portugal 's seven new stadiums for euro 2004 were built for less than half the price of the new wembley national stadium in north london .
the businessman , whose headquarters is just down the road from one of the two shiny new stadiums in lisbon - estadio jose alvalade - a futuristic , curvy ground with 52,000 seats , were far from convinced england had got good value for money .
yet other experts , including uk civil engineers , say wembley is worth every penny .
so has portugal got the bargains of the century , or is wembley vastly over-priced ?
